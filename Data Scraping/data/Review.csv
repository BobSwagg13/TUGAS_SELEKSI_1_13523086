179,5,7,8.3,2025-03-20,expert_overall,The price point is awesome for what you're getting from the Jordan Zion 4. I love the cushioning setup and the support feels great.
180,5,10,8.0,2025-03-12,expert_overall,I like playing in the Jordan Zion 4 but it's not my type of shoe. I prefer something more fluid. The cushioning feels nice though.
181,5,1,7.8,2025-02-28,expert_overall,"I can recommend the Zion 4 for people with narrow feet. It's bouncy, quick, and fun to play in."
182,5,9,7.6,2025-04-12,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 4 is a slightly below-average performer. It doesn't work for my feet, but I like the cushioning setup."
183,5,6,7.4,2025-03-12,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 4 is not it for me. My main issue is the heel slippage, but the traction was also lacking."
184,5,3,7.2,2025-05-11,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 4 is more spacious and smoother, but the traction and materials are a letdown."
185,5,15,7.7,2025-07-06,user_overall,
186,5,2,8.0,2025-02-28,traction,I like the rubber compound on this year's Zion model.
187,5,7,8.0,2025-03-20,traction,The traction performs well on clean floors but struggles on dirty floors. I enjoyed my time on cleaner courts.
188,5,10,8.0,2025-03-12,traction,You need to break in the traction for a good performance. It feels nice but is not top-tier.
189,5,1,8.0,2025-02-28,traction,Traction feels consistent. I also like the stopping power. They do pick up dust but it's easy to wipe.
190,5,9,8.0,2025-04-12,traction,"The traction performance is a lot better this year. It needs a break-in period, but it grips well afterward."
191,5,6,7.0,2025-03-12,traction,"I can only describe the traction as okay. It's decent and stops well, but it's nothing spectacular."
192,5,3,6.0,2025-05-11,traction,"The traction is meh. It picks up a lot of dust, and the performance is inconsistent."
193,5,2,9.0,2025-02-28,cushion,The cushioning is a huge improvement. The Cushlon 3.0 provides plenty of impact protection and feels bouncy and springy.
194,5,7,9.0,2025-03-20,cushion,The drop-in midsole is thin but feels plush and comfortable. I also like the full-length Zoom under the drop-in setup.
195,5,10,9.0,2025-03-12,cushion,There's a lot of compression under the heel. The cushioning is one of my favourite features.
196,5,1,8.5,2025-02-28,cushion,The cushioning feels incredibly responsive.
197,5,9,9.0,2025-04-12,cushion,"Cushioning is the standout feature and my favourite part of the shoe. The full-length Zoom Strobel unit is bouncy, and the drop-in midsole has plenty of step-in comfort."
198,5,6,8.0,2025-03-12,cushion,The cushioning is comfortable and bouncy. You get a lot of cushion but it's too high off the ground for me.
199,5,3,7.0,2025-05-11,cushion,The drop-in midsole feels sad. It's thin without much bounce back. Most of the bounce comes from the Zoom strobel board.
200,5,2,8.0,2025-02-28,materials,The upper feels supportive and contains my foot well during lateral movements.
201,5,7,8.0,2025-03-20,materials,You're not getting anything premium. The materials are nothing special but they do feel supportive.
202,5,10,7.0,2025-03-12,materials,The materials are stiff and don't get much softer with play. It feels durable and sturdy though.
203,5,1,7.0,2025-02-28,materials,A lot of the upper is basic but beefy. The breathability is impressive.
204,5,9,8.0,2025-04-12,materials,"The material starts stiff, but I like the padding. It becomes more comfortable over time."
205,5,6,8.0,2025-03-12,materials,"Most of the materials are textiles, and it feels stiff and rigid. Overall, the usage is fine. It gets the job done."
206,5,3,7.0,2025-05-11,materials,"The materials don't make sense to me. It's not soft or conforming, and I lacked breathability."
207,5,2,9.0,2025-02-28,support,I like how supportive the upper feels.
208,5,7,9.0,2025-03-20,support,This is a very supportive basketball shoe.
209,5,10,8.0,2025-03-12,support,"The upper is very supportive, and the drop-in midsole helps with containment. I did experience some minor heel slippage."
210,5,1,7.5,2025-02-28,support,I can feel slippage no matter how much I crank down the laces.
211,5,9,6.0,2025-04-12,support,The support is a downer for me. I dislike the lack of a shank plate and had a lot of heel slippage.
212,5,6,6.0,2025-03-12,support,"I had some issues with the support, mainly around the heel. My heel slid up and down, and it didn't get better."
213,5,3,8.0,2025-05-11,support,The support feels decent and playable.
214,5,2,8.0,2025-02-28,fit,The fit caters more towards narrower feet. It feels contained but is not accommodating.
215,5,7,7.5,2025-03-20,fit,"The midfoot is more accommodating this year, but the toe area slants inwards. It takes time to break in the fit."
216,5,10,8.0,2025-03-12,fit,The fit feels decent when you go with your proper size. The toe box is also snug.
217,5,1,8.0,2025-02-28,fit,The upper is fairly low volume. You also lose space and length because of the drop-in midsole.
218,5,9,7.0,2025-04-12,fit,"The fit is not accommodating for my wide feet, but it could be a solid option for players with narrow feet."
219,5,6,8.0,2025-03-12,fit,The fit is slightly more forgiving than the Zion 3. It's close to being a regular fit.
220,5,3,8.0,2025-05-11,fit,The fit feels standard and more accommodating.
221,5,2,0.0,2025-02-28,outdoor,I recommend staying indoors.
222,5,7,0.0,2025-03-20,outdoor,The outsole grooves are too shallow for outdoor use.
223,5,10,0.0,2025-03-12,outdoor,Durability is not the best because of the thinner grooves.
224,5,1,0.0,2025-02-28,outdoor,I don't think this pair is good for outdoor courts.
225,5,9,0.0,2025-04-12,outdoor,The outsole does not feel durable enough for outdoor use.
226,5,3,50.0,2025-05-11,outdoor,The durability for outdoors is fine.
227,5,7,2,2025-03-20,width,Go up half a size if you have a wide foot.
228,5,10,1,2025-03-12,width,The width is very narrow.
229,5,1,1,2025-02-28,width,2E feet can go up half a size for a performance fit or up a full size for a roomier fit.
230,5,9,2,2025-04-12,width,I would not recommend the Zion 4 for people with wide feet.
231,5,6,2,2025-03-12,width,Wider feet might need to go up half a size. It's a narrow shoe.
232,5,3,3,2025-05-11,width,This pair is wider than the Zion 3.
233,5,7,3,2025-03-20,size,I went true to size.
234,5,10,2,2025-03-12,size,I went up half a size.
235,5,1,3,2025-02-28,size,Narrow and medium feet can go true to size. Medium-footers can also consider going up half a size for extra room.
236,5,6,3,2025-03-12,size,I went true to size. Narrow and medium feet can go true to size. Everything else felt fine.
237,5,3,3,2025-05-11,size,Go true to size.
238,6,7,8.4,2025-05-27,expert_overall,"I can recommend the Nike KD 18. The traction performs well, but the cushioning could be better."
239,6,10,8.2,2025-03-12,expert_overall,"The KD 18 feels like a slightly better version of the KD 17. The traction is better, but the cushioning feels the same."
240,6,6,8.2,2025-03-24,expert_overall,"Nike didn't change much on the KD 18, but it's a solid performer. I like the improvements to the materials and the support."
241,6,3,8.2,2025-05-04,expert_overall,"I enjoy the Nike KD 18. There are no gimmicks. The traction and cushioning get the job done, and I like the extra structure of the midfoot caging."
242,6,9,8.2,2025-05-27,expert_overall,I like the Nike KD 18. It's more comfy but also slightly more clunky. There's not much difference from the KD 17.
243,6,1,7.8,2025-02-28,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 18 feels similar to the 17. I'm not a fan of the shank plate, but the shoe's overall performance is decent."
244,6,7,9.0,2025-05-27,traction,"The outsole is the same as last year, which is a good thing. I felt good making lateral and linear movements."
245,6,10,9.0,2025-03-12,traction,The traction performance feels amazing. It's much improved on dust.
246,6,6,8.0,2025-03-24,traction,You won't have issues on clean courts. The bite is solid. Expect to wipe on dustier courts.

248,6,9,8.0,2025-05-27,traction,The traction is good and reliable. I enjoy this setup.
249,6,1,8.0,2025-02-28,traction,The traction performs well as long as you keep the dust off.
250,6,7,7.5,2025-05-27,cushion,"The midsole is the same as last year. The forefoot Zoom unit is fairly muted, but the foam is decent."

254,6,9,8.0,2025-05-27,cushion,"Cushioning is comfortable, but it's the same as the KD 17."
255,6,1,7.0,2025-02-28,cushion,"The midsole is almost the same. There are only minor changes, but the forefoot Zoom Air unit feels bouncy."
256,6,7,8.5,2025-05-27,materials,"I like the material setup, even if it's synthetic. It feels like an upgrade from last year."
257,6,10,8.0,2025-03-12,materials,The upper materials are thin and breathable. I wish the toe box area were more structured. It feels too soft.
258,6,6,8.0,2025-03-24,materials,"I like the addition of the rubber cage. The rest of the materials feel better, too."
259,6,3,9.0,2025-05-04,materials,The mesh conforms to my feet extremely well. This is the most comfortable Nike shoe.
260,6,9,8.0,2025-05-27,materials,"The reinforced upper is welcome, and I like the lacing setup. The materials are also the biggest change from the KD 17."
261,6,1,9.0,2025-02-28,materials,The upper materials are my favourite part of the shoe. I like the rubber and eyelet setup. The engineering to help with breathability is impressive.
262,6,7,9.0,2025-05-27,support,My foot felt locked in thanks to the side caging and heel counter.
263,6,10,8.0,2025-03-12,support,"I like how supportive the plastic caging feels. The support and containment, in general, feel better this year."

267,6,1,8.0,2025-02-28,support,The upper makes lockdown much better.
268,6,7,8.0,2025-05-27,fit,The fit is tighter than previous models. It could be because of the extra padding.

270,6,6,8.0,2025-03-24,fit,The fit is similar to the KD 17. Most people will be okay with the fit.
271,6,3,8.0,2025-05-04,fit,I needed to go down half a size to get a secure fit. The lacing didn't work at larger sizes.

273,6,1,7.0,2025-02-28,fit,The shoe feels tapered. My right foot was going numb after extended play.

286,7,10,8.6,2025-03-12,expert_overall,I thoroughly enjoyed playing in the Nike LeBron NXXT Genisus. The only downsides are the shoe's short length and restrictive heel. Everything else performed exceptionally well.
287,7,7,8.2,2025-04-03,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron NXXT Genisus is a good basketball shoe, but not at the retail price. The traction is consistent, and the support and fit feel secure. I wish they kept the heel Zoom bag, though."

291,7,3,7.8,2025-02-28,expert_overall,I didn't like the Nike LeBron NXXT Genisus much. I prefer the previous iteration because of its better traction performance and upper.

297,7,6,8.0,2025-02-28,traction,"The wide herringbone traction is better than expected. The bite is solid, and I felt good on clean courts. Be prepared for slight slippage on dirtier courts."
298,7,3,7.0,2025-02-28,traction,The traction pattern is the same as the Zoom Generation. I give it a 7 out of 10.
299,7,10,9.0,2025-03-12,cushion,I like the heel compression and the extra bit of bounce. My feet didn't hurt at all.
300,7,7,8.0,2025-04-03,cushion,The cushioning feels like a downgrade from the NXXT Gen. There's only a forefoot Zoom unit and nothing under the heel.

303,7,6,8.0,2025-02-28,cushion,The cushioning feels pretty good. Impact protection is decent under the heel.
304,7,3,8.0,2025-02-28,cushion,The forefoot Zoom unit is the only positive for the cushioning. It does the job but isn't as bouncy as the main line.
305,7,10,8.0,2025-03-12,materials,The materials were stiff initially but softened over time. I also felt contained and supported.
306,7,7,6.5,2025-04-03,materials,"The material setup feels cheap, but breaks in nicely and is breathable."
307,7,9,8.0,2025-04-28,materials,All the materials are synthetic. It feels soft but not breathable.
308,7,1,8.0,2025-02-28,materials,There's a lot of padding around the ankle collar and thins out around the forefoot.
309,7,6,8.0,2025-02-28,materials,"Nike uses a textile mesh for the upper materials. It feels cheap to the touch, but the performance is solid. I had no issues."
310,7,3,8.0,2025-02-28,materials,The materials make a plasticky sound. Breathability is great.
311,7,10,9.0,2025-03-12,support,My feet feel contained and locked into the upper material. Not much else is needed. The only downside is the restrictive containment around the heel area.

313,7,9,9.0,2025-04-28,support,I like the carbon plate for torsional support. You feel locked in and secure at all times.
314,7,1,9.0,2025-02-28,support,Lockdown on this pair is fantastic. The rearfoot around the ankle also has a strong heel counter. It starts stiff and takes time to break in.
315,7,6,8.0,2025-02-28,support,I had zero issues with the support and lockdown.
316,7,3,8.0,2025-02-28,support,"Lockdown and support are secure, and ankle mobility is slightly better than other lows on the market."

327,7,9,3,2025-04-28,width,This shoe is wide-foot friendly.

335,7,3,3,2025-02-28,size,This shoe runs true to size.
336,8,10,8.8,2025-04-12,expert_overall,"The Nike G.T. Cut 3 Turbo is a fantastic performer. It has a high price tag, but I love the traction and upgraded support."
337,8,3,8.8,2025-04-12,expert_overall,"The Turbo is a much different shoe than the original. Lockdown and containment feel better, and I still love the cushioning."
338,8,1,8.7,2025-04-12,expert_overall,I recommend the Nike G.T. Cut 3 Turbo for anyone who enjoys the original but wants a more stable experience.
339,8,6,8.2,2025-04-12,expert_overall,"The Nike G.T. Cut 3 Turbo has improved support and lockdown, but the increased price is not worth it."

341,8,3,9.0,2025-04-12,traction,The traction performance is better. I experienced less dust pickup and more consistent performance.
342,8,1,10.0,2025-04-12,traction,"The outsole tread is the same as the G.T. Cut 3. Dust pickup seems better, but it does affect performance slightly. I like the stopping power better on this pair."
343,8,6,8.0,2025-04-12,traction,The traction performance feels good. You'll have no issues on clean courts.
344,8,10,8.0,2025-04-12,cushion,The cushioning is a bit more plush because of the new foam insole. The rebound and bounce also feel good.
345,8,3,10.0,2025-04-12,cushion,The cushioning feels the same. It's loaded and feels delicious.
346,8,1,9.5,2025-04-12,cushion,I like the midsole. The shank is plastic but springy and responsive. It feels fantastic.

348,8,10,9.0,2025-04-12,materials,"I enjoy the updated upper. The quality feels better, and the materials are soft. One of the downsides is the lack of ventilation."

616,13,3,8.0,2025-01-27,materials,There's nothing truly impressive but it gets the job done.
617,13,1,8.0,2024-12-21,support,The strap helps with heel slippage and lockdown. I felt plenty stable in this pair.

640,14,6,6.0,2024-12-21,traction,"You'll have no issues on clean courts, but any dust will create a bad experience. The performance becomes poor on dust. I experienced a lot of sliding."
641,14,10,6.0,2024-12-21,traction,The traction is not that good. It's okay on clean courts but you need to break it in. The main issue is the performance does not bite through dust well.

646,14,1,8.0,2024-12-21,materials,The materials are not fantastic but they get the job done. It's not light but it works. Only the tongue offers breathability. Moisture retention can be an issue.
647,14,3,7.0,2024-12-21,materials,It doesn't bother me functionally but the materials feel hard. Breathability is an issue though.
648,14,6,8.0,2024-12-21,materials,The mesh feels stiff but the materials get the job done performance-wise.
649,14,10,6.0,2024-12-21,materials,The upper quality is stiff and I'm not a fan. I also wish there was more padding in the tongue.

719,15,6,3,2025-01-05,width,The width feels normal.
720,15,1,3,2024-12-21,size,Narrow feet can go down half a size for a performance fit or true to size for a roomier fit. A medium foot can also go true to size.
721,15,10,3,2025-01-02,size,I went true to size.
722,15,9,3,2025-01-05,size,I always go up a size for the extra width in my foot but you may be able to go true to size.
723,15,3,3,2024-12-21,size,True to size is the best option.
724,15,6,3,2025-01-05,size,I recommend going true to size.

745,16,3,9.0,2024-12-21,materials,"Materials are a strong aspect of the Shadow 6. It feels smooth and conforming, and everything is good to go."
746,16,6,8.0,2024-12-21,materials,The upper is a type of textile. It gets the job done performance-wise.
747,16,10,8.0,2024-12-21,materials,The materials on my pair are thin and soft. I'm not a fan of the laces though.
748,16,7,6.5,2024-12-21,materials,I like materials the least on the shoe. The upper doesn't break in nicely or expand during play. I prefer mesh like some of the other colourways.
749,16,23,7.0,2025-01-24,materials,"The material quality varies depending on the colourway. We recommend going with the thinner, lighter pairs."
750,16,1,9.0,2024-12-21,support,"I had zero heel slippage, and I love the shank. Lateral support and containment also feel good."

777,17,2,8.6,2025-02-03,expert_overall,"Anta made minor adjustments to the KT 10, which made a big difference. The cushioning and support are impressive."
778,17,10,8.0,2025-01-09,expert_overall,"I love the cushioning and stability of the Anta KT 10, but the traction on dusty courts made me feel unsafe."
779,17,29,9.0,2025-07-25,user_overall,"Anta KT10 is true to size and great traction and cushion for play, width is little bit roomy for me but I have average width but most of people will be OK."

785,17,1,10.0,2025-01-09,traction,The stopping power is incredible and the outsole feels tacky. These do pick up dust but I didn't have any issues.
786,17,3,10.0,2025-01-09,traction,The traction is insane. I would rank this as a 10 out of 10. I had hard stops and there was never a moment I felt any slippage.
787,17,2,9.0,2025-02-03,traction,"My outsole picked up a bit of dust, but the performance was not affected. I didn't slip at all."
788,17,10,6.0,2025-01-09,traction,The traction is the shoe's Achilles heel in my opinion. The stop is only impressive on the cleanest courts. Dust causes this shoe a lot of issues. I experienced some severe slipping.
789,17,23,9.5,2025-01-09,cushion,"The cushioning feels stiff out of the box, and you need to break it in. Once broken in, it becomes stable, bouncy, and smooth."
790,17,1,10.0,2025-01-09,cushion,This cushioning setup feels incredibly bouncy and springy.
791,17,3,10.0,2025-01-09,cushion,The cushioning is delicious. The midsole is loaded and the impact protection under the heel is impressive. This setup is bouncy and responsive.
792,17,2,9.0,2025-02-03,cushion,"The foam in this shoe is upgraded from the previous one. It feels bouncy after breaking in, and the impact protection is solid."
793,17,10,9.0,2025-01-09,cushion,"Court feel and responsiveness are slightly above average, and the impact protection feels very nice."
794,17,23,9.0,2025-01-09,materials,"The materials are lightweight and durable, and the setup works well on the court. For synthetic materials, it feels as premium on the foot as possible."
795,17,1,9.0,2025-01-09,materials,The breathability and comfort of the upper is awesome. Upper construction doesn't get much better than this.
796,17,3,8.0,2025-01-09,materials,"The materials do not impress me, but the functionality is solid."
797,17,2,8.0,2025-02-03,materials,The upper and tongue are padded and comfortable. The quality isn't the best but it gets the job done.
798,17,10,8.0,2025-01-09,materials,The material quality feels a little cheap. The performance works and feels nice though.
799,17,23,10.0,2025-01-09,support,"Support is also a standout feature. It feels secure and stable. Once broken in, the shank plate also provides lots of torsional rigidity."
800,17,1,10.0,2025-01-09,support,"I had no heel slippage. The shank does a solid job with torsional support, and the shoe and flange construction keep your feet secure and stable."
801,17,3,9.0,2025-01-09,support,"Lockdown is a highlight, and the torsional support is also impressive. This is a sturdy shoe in a good way."
802,17,2,8.0,2025-02-03,support,The shoe feels stable and secure. I felt contained laterally. Heel containment also feels nice.
803,17,10,8.0,2025-01-09,support,I was good to go for lateral containment and stability. The heel lockdown feels nice too.
804,17,23,9.0,2025-01-09,fit,The shoe's construction provides natural foot movements. It feels snug but breaks in well.
805,17,1,8.0,2025-01-09,fit,The KT 10 fit is a lot more forgiving than the KT 9.
806,17,3,8.0,2025-01-09,fit,The fit feels standard. There's nothing special here.
807,17,2,9.0,2025-02-03,fit,I like the fit. It's perfect around my feet.
808,17,10,9.0,2025-01-09,fit,The KT 10 fits extremely well. I enjoy the snug fit.
809,17,1,50.0,2025-01-09,outdoor,The outsole rubber is too thin to hold up for long outdoors.
810,17,10,50.0,2025-01-09,outdoor,The rubber feels decent for outdoor courts.
811,17,1,3,2025-01-09,width,2E feet can go true to size for a performance fit or up half a size for a roomier fit.
812,17,3,3,2025-01-09,width,The width feels spot-on.
813,17,10,1,2025-01-09,width,Go up at least half a size if you have a wide foot.
814,17,1,3,2025-01-09,size,Narrow and medium feet can go true to size.
815,17,3,3,2025-01-09,size,Go true to size.

817,18,32,8.0,2024-11-11,expert_overall,"Everything about the Tatum 3 is decent. Some aspects could be better like the traction, but it works well overall."
818,18,6,7.8,2024-11-11,expert_overall,I can't recommend the Jordan Tatum 3. The containment issues and dust pick-up turned me away. I do like the comfortable cushioning.
819,18,33,7.8,2024-11-11,expert_overall,The Jordan Tatum 3 is Jayson Tatum's best signature sneaker so far. The cushioning and traction perform well.
820,18,5,7.8,2024-11-22,expert_overall,This is the best Tatum shoe to drop so far. It's nice to see a brand slowly improve.
821,18,7,7.8,2024-11-22,expert_overall,I recommend waiting for a sale before getting the Jordan Tatum 3. It's the best shoe in the lineup because of the traction. The cushioning could be better and the support is decent.
822,18,3,7.7,2024-11-11,expert_overall,The Jordan Tatum is smoother than previous models. The outsole composition is better and I like the material usage.
823,18,1,7.2,2024-11-11,expert_overall,"When the Tatum 3 grips, it offers light, quick pop and performance. The problem is the shoe is inconsistent."
824,18,10,7.2,2024-11-11,expert_overall,The Jordan Tatum 3 let me down. I can't recommend it because of the inconsistent traction and the lack of support.
825,18,34,10.0,2024-12-20,user_overall,
826,18,32,7.5,2024-11-11,traction,"The traction is inconsistent. There is a lot of dust pickup, and I experienced occasional slipping."
827,18,6,8.0,2024-11-11,traction,"You won't have issues with clean courts. Dustier courts were a problem, though, as the outsole is a dust magnet."
828,18,33,8.0,2024-11-11,traction,I have no complaints about the traction inside or out.
829,18,5,8.0,2024-11-22,traction,I was able to stick and move the way I preferred.
830,18,7,8.5,2024-11-22,traction,The traction sticks well laterally and linearly on clean courts. Make sure to wipe on dusty courts.
831,18,3,7.5,2024-11-11,traction,The traction performance improves marginally. I would say this is a B-tier outsole.
832,18,1,7.0,2024-11-11,traction,I'm confused by the outsole tread. Consistency is the main issue. It grabs well sometimes but horribly at other times.
833,18,10,7.0,2024-11-11,traction,"On clean courts, the traction has a solid bite. However, dust is a problem; it affects the performance a lot."
834,18,32,8.5,2024-11-11,cushion,The foam is comfortable on your feet but there's not a lot of impact protection.
835,18,6,8.0,2024-11-11,cushion,The cushioning is comfortable for the most part. I like the heel impact protection too.
836,18,33,8.0,2024-11-11,cushion,The cushioning setup is interesting. Cushlon 3.0 feels very comfortable. It's an upgrade from the last couple of shoes.
837,18,5,8.0,2024-11-22,cushion,The cushioning is comfier than it looks. I enjoy the performance and comfort of the Cushlon 3.0 foam.
838,18,7,7.5,2024-11-22,cushion,The Cushlon 3.0 feels soft and elastic. It has some bounce with every step. I didn't feel the Zoom unit though.
839,18,3,8.0,2024-11-11,cushion,"I thought the cushioning would be improved, but it performs similarly. The midsole feels softer but it's not bouncy or responsive."
840,18,1,6.0,2024-11-11,cushion,"I like Cushlon 3.0 foam but there's no shank, which causes slight stress. The forefoot is bouncy, though."
841,18,10,7.0,2024-11-11,cushion,"The cushioning isn't the best either. I dislike the heel cushioning, but the court feel is solid."
842,18,32,8.5,2024-11-11,materials,The materials are light and flexible. It's not durable but it gets the job done.
843,18,6,8.0,2024-11-11,materials,The textile upper gets the job done well.
844,18,33,8.0,2024-11-11,materials,The materials are nothing fancy. It feels flexible and breathable. The setup works well performance-wise. I can't complain.
845,18,5,8.0,2024-11-22,materials,The materials feel nice. I enjoy the combination of textiles and how flexible they are on feet.
846,18,7,7.0,2024-11-22,materials,The mesh materials are minimal and breathable. It gets the job done but it's not premium.
847,18,3,8.0,2024-11-11,materials,The materials break in easily. It feels comfortable. There are no stiff corners or breathability issues.
848,18,1,8.0,2024-11-11,materials,The upper handles heat well. It also does a decent job with lockdown.
849,18,10,9.0,2024-11-11,materials,I like the material quality and comfort. It feels thin and conforms to my feet well.
850,18,32,8.5,2024-11-11,support,"The shoe felt stable, and my foot was not moving within the containment."
851,18,6,7.0,2024-11-11,support,I had some support issues with this shoe. The soft upper doesn't offer as much containment as I want.
852,18,33,7.0,2024-11-11,support,"I like the support setup. It could be better, but it's adequate for the price. A lateral outrigger would be helpful."
853,18,5,7.0,2024-11-22,support,Support could have been better. There are no standout features.
854,18,7,8.0,2024-11-22,support,"The heel cup and lateral wall contain you well, but the Cushlon 3.0 around the midfoot causes some instability. Keep in mind, that there is no shank plate."
855,18,3,7.0,2024-11-11,support,The upper softens over time causing some heel slippage.
856,18,1,8.0,2024-11-11,support,The side-to-side flexibility feels stable and contained.
857,18,10,6.0,2024-11-11,support,The upper support is terrible. My foot never left the footbed but the containment was not good. I wish there was more structural support.
858,18,32,8.5,2024-11-11,fit,The stretch and containment of the upper keep you secure. I didn't have any issues with fit.
859,18,6,8.0,2024-11-11,fit,You won't feel any discomfort with the fit. It feels better after a few games too.
860,18,33,8.0,2024-11-11,fit,I don't like the last but the fit works.
861,18,5,8.0,2024-11-22,fit,"The fit isn't my preferred snug level, but it's still comfortable."
862,18,7,8.0,2024-11-22,fit,"There is no dead space in the forefoot, which I like. The overall fit is enjoyable."
863,18,3,8.0,2024-11-11,fit,I like how the shoe fits my foot.
864,18,1,7.0,2024-11-11,fit,The forefoot shape is fantastic. The problem is the rubber at the sides of the shoe; they affect the comfort of the fit.
865,18,10,7.0,2024-11-11,fit,"The fit loosens up over time because of the materials. Otherwise, I had no issues."
866,18,5,0.0,2024-11-22,outdoor,I would stay inside with this traction pattern.
867,18,7,50.0,2024-11-22,outdoor,I think you can use this pair outdoors.

892,19,1,9.0,2024-11-11,traction,The outsole tread is a pleasant surprise. This traction is one of the most surefooted of the year.
893,19,7,8.0,2024-11-22,traction,The outsole sticks like glue on clean floors but struggles with dust.
894,19,10,8.0,2024-11-22,traction,The traction is poor initially but improves a lot over time. I slipped a bit on dusty courts but never felt out of control.
895,19,6,7.0,2024-11-22,traction,"You won't have issues with traction on clean courts, but you'll struggle on dusty courts. Dust pickup is an issue."

900,19,1,9.5,2024-11-11,cushion,"The midsole feels responsive and supportive. The bounce is also incredible, and the shock absorption is some of the best in basketball shoes."
901,19,7,9.5,2024-11-22,cushion,The Zoom unit under the forefoot is snappy and bouncy. There's also plenty of impact protection. You'll be protected no matter your position.
902,19,10,10.0,2024-11-22,cushion,The cushioning setup is amazing. It feels like the best cushioning in the LeBron signature line. I love the Zoom units.

904,19,3,9.0,2024-11-11,cushion,Cushioning remains a strong feature. The performance and bounce are excellent. It's easy to jump in this shoe.

907,19,32,9.0,2024-11-11,cushion,"The foam feels soft and smooth, and there are so many cushioning layers. It's hard to activate, but the impact protection is impressive."
908,19,1,8.0,2024-11-11,materials,"The upper uses chunky synthetic leather, and there are also thick layers of padding throughout the shoe. The only downside is the weight."
909,19,7,8.0,2024-11-22,materials,"The materials are mostly synthetic. It's not a breathable shoe, and the upper runs hot. However, I do like this setup better than the LeBron 21."
910,19,10,8.0,2024-11-22,materials,The materials are decent. I like how soft the upper feels. It's supportive and conforms to my feet nicely.
911,19,6,9.0,2024-11-22,materials,The materials perform well. Breathability is the only concern. I like the comfort around my feet during play.
912,19,3,8.0,2024-11-11,materials,"Unfortunately, the 22 feels heavier than the 20 and 21. The synthetic leather feels soft, smooth, and conforming though."
913,19,2,8.0,2024-11-14,materials,"The upper needs no break-in time. It feels soft out of the box, but the breathability could be better."
914,19,20,8.0,2025-06-13,materials,"I like the material quality, and I have no complaints about the assembly. My main complaint is the weight."
915,19,32,7.0,2024-11-11,materials,"The materials feel bulky and clunky, and the structure is rigid and stiff. This feels like a step back."
916,19,1,9.0,2024-11-11,support,I like the support added by the midfoot saddle. The outsole flange also provides extra stability.
917,19,7,9.5,2024-11-22,support,"This is a very supportive basketball shoe. The ankle support feels great, and the torsional support is incredibly rigid. You have to break in the flexibility to get rid of the stiffness."
918,19,10,9.0,2024-11-22,support,I was good to go with the support and lockdown. I had no issues with lateral containment.
919,19,6,9.0,2024-11-22,support,The support is phenomenal on the LeBron 22. I had no heel slippage or side-to-side movements.

929,19,2,8.0,2024-11-14,fit,I like how the lacing system helps with the fit. The soft materials feel good on my feet too.
930,19,20,7.0,2025-06-13,fit,"The fit is almost 1-to-1. I had an issue with the laces rubbing my foot, though."
931,19,32,7.5,2024-11-11,fit,The length feels good and I enjoy the true-to-size fit.
932,19,1,0.0,2024-11-11,outdoor,The rubber is too thin for outdoor use.

935,19,3,50.0,2024-11-11,outdoor,My guess is this shoe will be fine outdoors.
936,19,2,100.0,2024-11-14,outdoor,I have the EP version and the outsole is very durable.
937,19,7,3,2024-11-22,width,The shoe is more wide-foot friendly than other LeBron shoes.
938,19,10,2,2024-11-22,width,The forefoot is slightly narrow.
939,19,6,3,2024-11-22,width,"I have a slightly wide foot, and I felt good."

948,20,7,8.5,2024-11-02,expert_overall,"I enjoyed playing in the Nike Ja 2. It's Kobe-esque, but there are other better-cushioned options available. The traction plays well, and I like the snug fit."
949,20,3,8.4,2024-11-01,expert_overall,"The Nike Ja 2 is one of the most practical, no-BS Nike shoes. The shoe's strengths are traction, weight, and agility."
950,20,1,8.4,2024-10-11,expert_overall,The outsole traction performance makes the Nike Ja 2 a fun shoe. The downside is this shoe feels too similar to the Sabrina 2.
951,20,20,8.4,2025-05-17,expert_overall,The Nike Ja 2 is a good basketball shoe. I enjoyed the traction performance. The shoe is best for lightweight and shifty players.
952,20,33,8.2,2024-10-11,expert_overall,"I like the Nike Ja 2 slightly more than the Ja 1. The outsole is grippy and the cushioning feels a bit better. Like all Nike basketball shoes lately, this reminds me of Kobe shoes."
953,20,2,8.0,2024-10-23,expert_overall,"The Nike Ja 2 is a lightweight performance shoe with awesome traction. However, the impact protection is lacking."
954,20,6,8.0,2024-10-30,expert_overall,The Nike Ja 2 is a solid performer with decent traction and cushioning.
955,20,10,7.8,2024-10-16,expert_overall,"I prefer the Nike Ja 1 because of the fit, but the Ja 2 provides a softer, minimal upper. The comfort feels decent, and the traction performs well."
956,20,5,7.8,2024-10-23,expert_overall,The Nike Ja 2 feels like a generic and basic Nike sneaker. The traction plays well and is the best feature.
957,20,9,7.6,2025-04-12,expert_overall,"There are two main changes to the Nike Ja 2. It feels less supportive, but the materials are better. The traction remains a strong point."
958,20,38,7.5,2025-07-29,user_overall,The Ja 2’s are budget friendly coming in at $160CAD. They offer good support and average cushion. They have good grip on a clean court but are average on a dusty one. They fit a bit narrower compared to the ones in my opinion. I feel as the Ja 2’s have nice colourways compared to the Ja 1’s but for performance I’d go with the Ja 1  personally.
959,20,39,8.5,2024-11-15,user_overall,Keeping it simple. Good shoe if your feet are narrow. Everything checked out good but I returned my pair because they were way too narrow.
960,20,40,8.6,2025-07-10,user_overall,Traction on these is awesome and the cushion is good durability is awesome and for the price? It’s an easy cop

967,20,33,9.0,2024-10-11,traction,Traction is the best feature once broken in. There's a ton of grip.
968,20,2,9.0,2024-10-23,traction,The traction performance feels awesome. I didn't have any problems with dust either.
969,20,6,8.0,2024-10-30,traction,"The traction feels pretty good. I experienced minor slipping on dusty courts, but it was not a big deal."
970,20,10,9.0,2024-10-16,traction,The traction performs better with more playing time. You pretty much stop on a dime. I was also fine on dustier courts.
971,20,5,9.0,2024-10-23,traction,Traction is the shoe's best feature. It moves and sticks with my movements.
972,20,9,9.0,2025-04-12,traction,The traction feels amazing after an initial break-in period. Dust pickup is not an issue at all.
973,20,7,6.5,2024-11-02,cushion,The cushioning setup let me down. It's more or less the same as the Ja 1. I need more cushioning under my feet.
974,20,3,8.0,2024-11-01,cushion,"The midsole is more responsive than I expected. There's some more bounce, and the transition feels good."
975,20,1,9.0,2024-10-11,cushion,"The foam feels slightly dense, but the Zoom unit is very bouncy."
976,20,20,8.0,2025-05-17,cushion,"The cushioning is nothing fancy. It feels light and shifty, but the foam isn't too responsive. I like the Zoom unit, though."
977,20,33,8.0,2024-10-11,cushion,Cushioning hasn't changed much. The Phylon feels slightly better.
978,20,2,7.0,2024-10-23,cushion,"The cushioning feels similar, and the midsole feels thin. It's close to the ground but lacks impact protection."
979,20,6,8.0,2024-10-30,cushion,"Impact protection is decent, and the forefoot Zoom unit feels responsive."
980,20,10,7.0,2024-10-16,cushion,"The cushioning setup is disappointing and there is not much impact protection. This shoe is good for the court feel, though."
981,20,5,7.0,2024-10-23,cushion,The cushioning setup feels basic. There's nothing mindblowing about it.
982,20,9,7.0,2025-04-12,cushion,The cushioning setup is boring. Nike didn't make any updates. This setup isn't the best for impact protection.
983,20,7,8.0,2024-11-02,materials,"The materials are a lot softer. I like how the shoe feels, especially the mesh."
984,20,3,8.0,2024-11-01,materials,"The shoe is extremely lightweight. I had no pinching or discomfort, and the upper conforms to my feet nicely."
985,20,1,8.0,2024-10-11,materials,The materials feel basic and cheap. The upper provides decent containment.
986,20,20,8.0,2025-05-17,materials,The mesh materials feel standard but not premium. They feel light and comfortable.
987,20,33,7.0,2024-10-11,materials,"The materials are cheap, and there is no design. It works performance-wise, though."
988,20,2,8.0,2024-10-23,materials,The mesh upper feels lighter while remaining comfortable.
989,20,6,8.0,2024-10-30,materials,The materials perform well. It's fine.
990,20,10,8.0,2024-10-16,materials,"The mesh materials are thin and soft and there is no break-in time. The upper, as a whole, is minimal."
991,20,5,7.0,2024-10-23,materials,"The materials are lighter but feel cheaper. The shoe is still functional, though."
992,20,9,8.0,2025-04-12,materials,The materials are way softer and have a faster break-in period. I think it's an upgrade.
993,20,7,8.5,2024-11-02,support,I like the rigid internal heel counter and the outrigger. This is a supportive shoe for guards and slashers.
994,20,3,8.0,2024-11-01,support,Support and lateral containment are decent. I like the lockdown too.
995,20,1,8.0,2024-10-11,support,"I like the ankle support section, and the shank feels decent."
996,20,20,8.0,2025-05-17,support,"The shoe feels stable laterally, and the lockdown is decent. My only complaint is the lack of torsional stability."
997,20,33,8.0,2024-10-11,support,The support is decent. The upper and outrigger help provide stability. The lack of torsional stability is a minor gripe.
998,20,2,8.0,2024-10-23,support,The support mainly comes from the outsole and synthetic leather materials. It feels decently contained.
999,20,6,8.0,2024-10-30,support,I felt snug and secure within the shoe. I also had no issues with heel slippage or side-to-side movements.
1000,20,10,8.0,2024-10-16,support,"Torsional support is not the best, but the lateral containment is decent. I wish the upper were more supportive, though."
1001,20,5,8.0,2024-10-23,support,"I miss the heel padding and sculpting, but the performance remains solid."
1002,20,9,6.0,2025-04-12,support,"The support feels flimsier and less supportive, especially with the torsional support."
1003,20,7,9.0,2024-11-02,fit,The fit is close to being 1-to-1. I like the snug fit.
1004,20,3,8.0,2024-11-01,fit,I had issues with the fit. It felt good.
1005,20,1,8.0,2024-10-11,fit,I'm pleasantly surprised with the fit. There was zero break-in for my foot.

1011,20,5,8.0,2024-10-23,fit,The fit is enjoyable. I like the snug feeling.
1012,20,9,8.0,2025-04-12,fit,"The fit feels decent, but not as compatible with my wide feet. There's no heel slip or extra space within the shoe."
1013,20,7,0.0,2024-11-02,outdoor,I wouldn't bring this pair outdoors.
1014,20,3,50.0,2024-11-01,outdoor,I'm not sure about taking this pair outdoors.
1015,20,1,0.0,2024-10-11,outdoor,The rubber grooves are too thin for outdoors.

1033,21,7,8.5,2024-11-26,expert_overall,"The Puma MB.04 is the best-fitting shoe in LaMelo Ball's line. However, the rest of the performance feels like last year's model. I like the traction and support."

1210,25,6,8.0,2024-10-03,traction,You're not going to have any issues on clean courts. I experienced some minor sliding on dust. The gum rubber performed better than the translucent rubber pair.
1211,25,7,8.5,2024-11-06,traction,"The performance grips well on clean courts, but the grooves are tightly knit and dust can affect the rubber."
1212,25,9,9.0,2025-05-11,traction,"The outsole pattern offers multi-directional coverage, but there is a bit of dust pickup. The performance is excellent."

1219,25,3,9.0,2024-09-21,cushion,The cushioning is more than decent. I didn't expect this level of softness and responsiveness from Lightstrike.
1220,25,6,9.0,2024-10-03,cushion,The Lightstrike midsole feels comfortable and responsive. I like the compression around the heel area.

1236,25,19,8.0,2025-07-12,materials,The upper has multiple layers. It feels synthetic but smooth. I like the effort Adidas put in.
1237,25,45,7.0,2024-09-21,materials,"The upper is synthetic and offers structure. Breathability is an issue, though."
1238,25,10,7.0,2024-09-29,materials,"I'm not a fan of the upper. It breaks in nicely, but it feels too stiff and bulky. I like the inner booty, though."
1239,25,3,8.0,2024-09-21,support,The upper feels supportive and secure.
1240,25,6,9.0,2024-10-03,support,"I had zero issues with the support in the Dame 9. The upper adds to the support and structure, and the shank plate contains you torsionally."

1249,25,3,8.0,2024-09-21,fit,I experienced some heel slippage with my true size. Going down half a size made the fit feel much better.

1370,27,6,9.0,2024-10-16,fit,I felt good about the fit. The shoe breaks in nicely and it's close to a 1-to-1 fit.

1384,28,10,9.0,2024-11-11,expert_overall,The quality and tech of the Anta KAI 1 Speed are top-notch. It feels like the KAI 1 but it's lower to the ground and more responsive.
1385,28,3,8.5,2024-11-11,expert_overall,"The Anta KAI 1 Speed is faster, lighter, and stiffer than the KAI 1. This shoe is better for players who prioritize fast play styles."

1391,28,3,9.5,2024-11-11,traction,The traction has a strong grip on all court surfaces.
1392,28,1,9.5,2024-11-11,cushion,"The nitrogen-infused foam offers plenty of bounce, and it feels streamlined."
1393,28,7,9.0,2024-11-11,cushion,"The foam compound is lightweight, has great impact protection, and doesn't sacrifice court feel."
1394,28,10,9.0,2024-11-11,cushion,"The nitrogen-infused foam feels very soft. It feels great under the heel, and responsive in the forefoot."
1395,28,3,7.0,2024-11-11,cushion,"The cushioning is worse than the original. The midsole has some bounce, but it is not soft. It also lacks responsiveness."

1397,28,7,8.0,2024-11-11,materials,"The materials are nothing special, but the breathability is impressive."
1398,28,10,8.0,2024-11-11,materials,"The embroidered upper breaks in nicely. The regular KAI 1 is softer, but the Speed is still comfortable. I also love the tongue. It's plush and well-padded."

1421,29,5,8.2,2024-08-17,expert_overall,"There's nothing special about the Jordan Luka 3, but there's nothing that will hinder you as well."
1422,29,3,8.2,2024-10-10,expert_overall,"The Luka 3 doesn't feel premium, but the performance is decent. It caters to slower-paced players or spot-up shooters. I like the containment and traction."

1432,29,8,8.0,2024-08-07,traction,The traction performs well but isn't quite top-tier. Make sure to wipe the dust.
1433,29,10,8.0,2024-08-06,traction,"The traction performance is on or off depending on the court condition. The bite is top-tier on cleaner courts, but the outsole picks up dust quickly."
1434,29,5,9.0,2024-08-17,traction,Traction is the strongest and most appealing feature.
1435,29,3,9.0,2024-10-10,traction,The traction performance is really good. I never had issues no matter the court conditions.

1439,29,6,8.0,2024-08-06,cushion,The Cushlon 3.0 midsole is comfortable and responsive. The impact protection is also adequate. I felt quick in this shoe.
1440,29,8,8.0,2024-08-07,cushion,Cushlon 3.0 isn't a major improvement. It feels marginally better than the Luka 2. The setup is low to the ground and has less impact protection.
1441,29,10,8.0,2024-08-06,cushion,"The cushioning feels nice, but the performance isn't amazing. It's a responsive and low setup. I also like the court feel."
1442,29,5,8.0,2024-08-17,cushion,The Cushlon 3.0 is nothing special but it isn't bad. It feels subtle and chill.
1443,29,3,7.0,2024-10-10,cushion,Cushioning is not bad. It feels stiff at first but softens up over time. The performance is satisfactory.
1444,29,20,9.0,2024-11-26,cushion,The Cushlon 3.0 foam gets the job done for impact protection. The court feel is also present.
1445,29,7,8.0,2025-03-12,cushion,"The Cushlon 3.0 feels soft, and the EVA is firm and stable. It breaks in nicely. My only concern is how long it will last."
1446,29,1,8.0,2024-08-06,cushion,The Cushlon 3.0 is a fairly balanced foam. There's a small amount of bounce as well.
1447,29,6,8.0,2024-08-06,materials,The upper is a combination of textile materials and synthetic leather. It gets the job done.
1448,29,8,8.0,2024-08-07,materials,The materials are comfortable and accommodating but are not premium.
1449,29,10,9.0,2024-08-06,materials,I like how the textile materials feel. It breaks in nicely and becomes soft around your feet.
1450,29,5,8.0,2024-08-17,materials,There's nothing crazy about the materials. It's soft enough to get the job done.
1451,29,3,8.0,2024-10-10,materials,"The materials are not soft or plush, but there was no pinching or discomfort."
1452,29,20,7.0,2024-11-26,materials,"The upper starts stiff and the materials feel bland. Make sure to break the shoe in. Also, breathability is an issue."
1453,29,7,7.0,2025-03-12,materials,"I like the padding around the tongue and the back of the shoe. The other materials are cheap-feeling synthetic, but I'm not complaining."
1454,29,1,8.0,2024-08-06,materials,"Padding around the tongue is substantial, but the upper materials aren't too durable. Breathability is also not the best. However, the upper is comfortable on foot."

1457,29,10,8.0,2024-08-06,support,I was good to go laterally because of the supportive material and the iso plate. My foot felt locked in.
1458,29,5,8.0,2024-08-17,support,Lockdown and stability are solid. I like the Iso plate for lateral containment and stability.
1459,29,3,9.0,2024-10-10,support,"The midfoot feels rigid and stable. I felt contained, especially on lateral movements."

1493,30,6,8.0,2024-08-19,expert_overall,"I like everything about the Jordan 39 except for the support and stability. The cushioning is very comfortable, but I wish they would've put in a shank."

1509,30,20,9.0,2025-01-19,traction,"The grip is almost top-tier. I had no issues playing on professional, clean courts, and the performance also held up on dustier courts."

1512,30,3,10.0,2024-08-17,cushion,The cushioning is delicious. The full-length Zoom X and Zoom Air are loaded up. It's very bouncy. The only downside is it tires out my flat feet.
1513,30,7,9.5,2024-08-06,cushion,Cushioning is my favourite aspect of the shoe. The step-in comfort and ride are plush. This is one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn.
1514,30,33,9.0,2024-08-07,cushion,"The cushioning is fantastic. ZoomX is extremely bouncy and explosive, but the cup sole lacks stability."
1515,30,5,9.0,2024-08-27,cushion,The ZoomX foam and the Zoom Air unit might be the shoe's best feature. It's bouncy and comfortable. Beware if you like to be lower to the ground.

1519,30,10,7.0,2024-08-11,cushion,"I was excited about the ZoomX and Zoom Air, but it felt sloppy and slow during play. The lack of responsiveness did not feel good. The step-in comfort is soft and comfortable, though."
1520,30,1,8.0,2024-08-06,cushion,"I love 90% of the midsole setup. I love the arch support and the ZoomX setup, but there's no torsional stability. However, the bounce is unbelievable."

1522,30,7,9.5,2024-08-06,materials,"I love the ballistic nylon mesh. There's no break-in time required, and the shoe feels comfortable. However, there's next to no breathability."

1524,30,5,9.0,2024-08-27,materials,I love that Jordan Brand used leather on the upper. It should add lots of longevity.
1525,30,6,8.0,2024-08-19,materials,Materials feel comfortable. I like the quality as well.

1528,30,10,8.0,2024-08-11,materials,I like the material quality and construction. The tongue is also nicely padded.
1529,30,1,7.0,2024-08-06,materials,"The upper feels thick and padded. There's a lack of breathability, though. The ankle area caused some blistering during the break-in period."
1530,30,3,8.0,2024-08-17,support,"The shoe is missing an outrigger. The support and containment are decent, though."
1531,30,7,7.5,2024-08-06,support,Side-to-side stability is an issue because of the outsole construction. The heel lockdown is sturdy and solid.
1532,30,33,7.0,2024-08-07,support,The support takes a hit because of the lack of an outrigger and torsional stability.
1533,30,5,8.0,2024-08-27,support,The stability is nothing crazy. I can see how some players felt unstable.
1534,30,6,6.0,2024-08-19,support,Support is the worst part of the shoe. Torsional stability is non-existent because of the lack of a shank.
1535,30,9,7.0,2024-09-08,support,"There's no shank plate, which I dislike. I wish there were better torsional and lateral stability. I do enjoy the heel counter and base width."
1536,30,20,7.0,2025-01-19,support,"The lockdown has no problems, but the rounded outsole decreases stability."
1537,30,10,7.0,2024-08-11,support,"I had solid lateral containment, but the lateral stability was not up to par. The combination of dust pickup, no outrigger, and soft foam made me feel unstable."
1538,30,1,6.0,2024-08-06,support,The heel slippage gets better once you break in the collar area. The shoe feels incredibly unstable.
1539,30,3,9.0,2024-08-17,fit,"The fit feels standard, almost perfect. The toe box is also forgiving."
1540,30,7,9.0,2024-08-06,fit,The fit feels snug. I like how it feels with the padding and comfort.
1541,30,33,9.0,2024-08-07,fit,The fit is close to perfect. It feels comfortable around my feet.
1542,30,5,8.0,2024-08-27,fit,The materials will conform to your foot the more you play. The fit widens slightly.
1543,30,6,8.0,2024-08-19,fit,I enjoyed the fit. I felt snug and supported.
1544,30,9,8.0,2024-09-08,fit,The fit feels decent. It's snug and slightly long.
1545,30,20,6.0,2025-01-19,fit,"The fit caused me some discomfort in the ankle area. However, after I broke in the shoe it stopped rubbing."
1546,30,10,8.0,2024-08-11,fit,The fit feels snug and the shoe conforms to my feet nicely.
1547,30,1,7.0,2024-08-06,fit,"The fit feels more forgiving than other Jordan shoes, but the lack of containment features makes the performance tricky."
1548,30,3,0.0,2024-08-17,outdoor,The rubber feels too soft for outdoor use.
1549,30,9,0.0,2024-09-08,outdoor,I would not take this pair outdoors.

1555,30,6,3,2024-08-19,width,The width is fairly accommodating for slightly wide feet.
1556,30,9,2,2024-09-08,width,The shoe is not the best for wide feet.
1557,30,10,3,2024-08-11,width,The width feels normal.
1558,30,1,3,2024-08-06,width,2E feet can go true to size for a performance fit or up half a size for a roomier fit.
1559,30,7,3,2024-08-06,size,I went with my standard true-to-size fit.
1560,30,5,3,2024-08-27,size,I recommend going true to size.
1561,30,6,3,2024-08-19,size,I went true to size without an issue.

1563,30,10,3,2024-08-11,size,I suggest going true to size for a snug fit.
1564,30,1,3,2024-08-06,size,Narrow and medium feet can go true to size.
1565,31,7,8.7,2024-09-15,expert_overall,"I love the bang for your buck the Adidas AE 1 Low offers. My main gripe is the fit and sizing. However, the cushioning, traction, and support are all impressive."
1566,31,33,8.4,2024-09-05,expert_overall,"The AE 1 Low is still a solid performer. I enjoy the Lows better because of the fit, but the main difference between the two shoes is cushioning. The Lows are firmer."
1567,31,19,8.4,2025-07-05,expert_overall,"I like how the Adidas AE 1 Lows perform. The cushioning and support cater well to my play style, and I didn't have any issues with the traction."
1568,31,6,8.2,2024-08-18,expert_overall,"The Adidas AE 1 Low is a great shoe for the price. It's not for everyone because of the lack of impact protection, but I like the traction. The materials feel better on feet too."
1569,31,1,8.0,2024-08-18,expert_overall,The Adidas AE 1 Low feels clunky enough to be noticeable on feet. The shoe performance doesn't feel the same without the bigger ankle collar and upper materials.
1570,31,8,7.8,2024-08-18,expert_overall,"The Adidas AE 1 Low's fit throws off the shoe's performance. It affects the fit and heel containment. However, the traction and other support features are solid."
1571,31,3,7.0,2024-08-18,expert_overall,The AE 1 Low is the most disappointing release of 2024. The lack of heel slippage and fit affects performance too much. The cushioning also feels like a downgrade.

1577,31,7,9.0,2024-09-15,traction,Clean court performance is elite. You'll have to wipe occasionally on dirty courts.
1578,31,33,9.0,2024-09-05,traction,I didn't have any issues with the traction performance.
1579,31,19,9.0,2025-07-05,traction,I didn't have any issues with the traction. The court surface did not matter.
1580,31,6,9.0,2024-08-18,traction,The pattern is similar to the regular AE 1. The performance is top-notch. I didn't experience any issues.
1581,31,1,8.0,2024-08-18,traction,The outsole is similar to the AE 1. It has nice tackiness.
1582,31,8,9.0,2024-08-18,traction,"The traction works very well. It does pick up some dust, but wiping fixes it."
1583,31,3,8.0,2024-08-18,traction,"The traction also feels slightly worse, but it still performs well."
1584,31,7,9.0,2024-09-15,cushion,Light Boost provides soft compression under the heel. It feels plush underfoot.
1585,31,33,8.0,2024-09-05,cushion,"The Boost foam is slightly different. There's a lighter Boost, and it feels firmer. Impact protection takes a hit, and the cushioning feels grounded."
1586,31,19,9.0,2025-07-05,cushion,The midsole feels good. I wasn't worried about anything while playing in the AE 1 Low.
1587,31,6,8.0,2024-08-18,cushion,"This cushioning setup is responsive and low to the ground, even more than the regular AE 1. There's minimal impact protection."
1588,31,1,8.0,2024-08-18,cushion,The midsole is the most bizarre part of the shoe. The Light Boost foam isn't as bouncy as JetBoost but feels balanced.
1589,31,8,7.0,2024-08-18,cushion,"Cushioning feels like a slight downgrade. There's less impact protection, especially under the heel. The shoe feels low to the ground."
1590,31,3,7.0,2024-08-18,cushion,"The cushioning is not as bouncy, soft, or foamy as the mid-top AE 1. There's a better court feel, but it's a downgrade."
1591,31,7,8.0,2024-09-15,materials,Materials are the same as the mids.
1592,31,33,8.0,2024-09-05,materials,The materials feel and perform the same as the mid. I dig it.
1593,31,19,8.0,2025-07-05,materials,The materials are the same as the mid. There's a lot of rubber and textile.
1594,31,6,8.0,2024-08-18,materials,"The rubber TPU shell is the same, but the lace structure is different this time. It feels perfectly fine."
1595,31,1,7.5,2024-08-18,materials,"The tongue feels flimsier, and it doesn't aid with lockdown and I felt more slipping in the shoe. There's also a lot of moisture retention."
1596,31,8,8.0,2024-08-18,materials,"The shoe is lighter but still heavy because of the materials. I like the material setup, though."
1597,31,3,8.0,2024-08-18,materials,The shoe is still heavy because of the upper materials but is similar to the mid-top.
1598,31,7,9.0,2024-09-15,support,Sizing up half a size caused some heel slip. I enjoy the lateral and torsional stability.
1599,31,33,9.0,2024-09-05,support,"Outside of having fewer eyelets, the support is the same. I like the materials and base width. There's also lots of torsional rigidity."
1600,31,19,8.0,2025-07-05,support,I like the shank plate for stability.
1601,31,6,8.0,2024-08-18,support,The support felt great for me. I didn't experience any heel slippage or containment issues.
1602,31,1,8.5,2024-08-18,support,"Heel slippage is mild to begin but goes away after a break-in period. The upper material also offers solid containment, but lateral stability can be better."
1603,31,8,8.0,2024-08-18,support,"The support is the shoe's highlight, but I experienced minor heel slippage. The containment and stability are great, though."
1604,31,3,6.0,2024-08-18,support,Heel slippage is a problem. It throws off the support of the shoe.
1605,31,7,8.5,2024-09-15,fit,I had some issues with fit. The shoe feels smaller. I needed to lace up much tighter than usual.
1606,31,33,8.0,2024-09-05,fit,The fit feels fine. I didn't experience any heel slippage.
1607,31,19,8.0,2025-07-05,fit,"I like the snug heel sculpting. The Lows fit me better, especially around the toe box. I only needed one game to break this pair in."
1608,31,6,8.0,2024-08-18,fit,The fit feels slightly more snug. I think it's because of the heel padding. It also feels a tad long.
1609,31,1,8.0,2024-08-18,fit,The fit is slightly shorter with a generous width. There's no break-in for fit.
1610,31,8,7.0,2024-08-18,fit,"Fit is a concern. It feels long but not secure, especially around the heel."
1611,31,3,6.0,2024-08-18,fit,The fit is not good. The heel slippage affects how secure you feel. I wish there were more eyelets.
1612,31,7,0.0,2024-09-15,outdoor,I would not bring this pair outdoors.
1613,31,1,50.0,2024-08-18,outdoor,"The durometer is high, but the tread lines are narrow."
1614,31,8,0.0,2024-08-18,outdoor,The durability is not the best.
1615,31,6,3,2024-08-18,width,You might be able to go down half a size if you have skinny feet.
1616,31,1,3,2024-08-18,width,2E feet can go true to size for a performance fit or up half a size for a roomier fit.
1617,31,8,3,2024-08-18,width,Stay true to size if you have beefy feet.
1618,31,6,3,2024-08-18,size,I went true to size.
1619,31,1,3,2024-08-18,size,Narrow and medium feet can go true to size.
1620,31,8,4,2024-08-18,size,"The fit is technically true to size, but I recommend downsizing a half size for a more secure heel."
1621,31,3,4,2024-08-18,size,You cannot go true to size. I recommend going down half a size.
1622,32,32,9.0,2024-08-24,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom Freak 6 is well worth it. I like the tech, especially the comfortable cushioning."
1623,32,7,8.1,2024-08-27,expert_overall,The Nike Zoom Freak 6 takes an incremental step forward. I enjoy the lightweight materials and the responsive cushioning.
1624,32,3,8.0,2024-09-19,expert_overall,I don't have much to complain about with the Nike Zoom Freak 6. The traction is the best feature. I highly recommend waiting for sales.
1625,32,10,7.8,2024-09-15,expert_overall,"I like the comfort of the Nike Freak 6 but the quality could be better for a signature shoe. The cushioning is low to the ground, and the traction performs well after breaking in."
1626,32,6,7.8,2024-09-23,expert_overall,The Zoom Freak 6 has decent performance. There are only minor issues with dust accumulation and heel slippage. The rest of the features perform well.
1627,32,20,7.8,2025-02-15,expert_overall,"The Zoom Freak 6 is adequate. The materials are crappy, and the upper is too flimsy to keep you contained. It's a shoe meant for light and shifty guards."
1628,32,1,7.2,2024-08-24,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom Freak 6 feels great initially. However, wear and tear can deteriorate the build quality and containment."
1629,32,68,8.6,2025-01-07,user_overall,"O tênis é excelente pra Armadores ou Alas rápidos, leve, amortecimento muito bem balanceado, nem muito simples mas nem tão tecnológico, tração fixa muito bem nas quadras internas, esquenta um pouco os pés… poderia ser mais respirável, além que o suporte é “Ok”, senti falta de uma placa somente, mas em geral o tênis é bom"

1632,32,32,9.0,2024-08-24,traction,The traction feels good right out of the box. Wiping is needed because the outsole picks up dust.
1633,32,7,8.5,2024-08-27,traction,The traction pattern performs at an almost elite level on clear floors. You won't run into many issues with dust as long as you wipe.
1634,32,3,8.5,2024-09-19,traction,The traction performance is excellent. It performs well on clean and dusty courts. Everything was good to go.
1635,32,10,8.0,2024-09-15,traction,The traction performance stops well on clean courts but is not the best on dusty courts. It gets better after a break-in period.
1636,32,6,8.0,2024-09-23,traction,The Giannis logo traction pattern performs decently well. Don't let dust accumulate or you'll slide.
1637,32,20,8.0,2025-02-15,traction,"The traction bites into a clean hardwood well, but I slid slightly on dustier courts."
1638,32,1,8.0,2024-08-24,traction,"The grip on this outsole is fantastic. It picks up dust, but the performance isn't affected much."
1639,32,32,9.5,2024-08-24,cushion,There's a lot of responsiveness in the forefoot. I enjoyed the shock absorption and impact protection. It's very comfortable.
1640,32,7,8.0,2024-08-27,cushion,The Cushlon 2.0 has decent impact protection and springiness. The Zoom Air bag under the forefoot also offers some bounciness. It's not special but the cushioning feels natural.
1641,32,3,8.0,2024-09-19,cushion,The cushioning feels similar to the last model. It feels nice on my feet and I like the bounce back under the heel.
1642,32,10,7.0,2024-09-15,cushion,"The cushioning setup feels nice, but it's not worth the price. Impact protection is okay."
1643,32,6,8.0,2024-09-23,cushion,This shoe has a decent cushioning setup. The Cushlon is soft and the Zoom unit has some bounce.
1644,32,20,8.0,2025-02-15,cushion,The heel does not provide impact protection. It's suitable for shifty guards but not bigger players. The court feel is also great.
1645,32,1,7.0,2024-08-24,cushion,"The midsole setup is similar to the Zoom Freak 5. There's a forefoot Zoom unit, but there's no shank. The cushioning does feel springy while being low to the ground."
1646,32,32,8.5,2024-08-24,materials,The materials feel nice but are not premium.
1647,32,7,6.5,2024-08-27,materials,Materials are nothing special. The synthetic leather feels cheap. The rest of the materials feel solid with no break-in time.
1648,32,3,8.0,2024-09-19,materials,"The synthetic materials feel cheap, but the upper conforms to your feet well enough. I like the ventilation and flexibility."
1649,32,10,8.0,2024-09-15,materials,"The upper materials are incredibly soft. The quality isn't the best, though."
1650,32,6,7.0,2024-09-23,materials,The materials feel plasticky but they get the job done.
1651,32,20,7.0,2025-02-15,materials,There's nothing much to look at for materials. The upper feels light but is nothing fancy. I'm not a fan.
1652,32,1,8.0,2024-08-24,materials,"I like the light, breathable weave upper. It feels comfortable. The padding is thick, which can affect breathability."
1653,32,32,9.0,2024-08-24,support,Support and lockdown are solid. You feel locked in without feeling constricting.
1654,32,7,8.5,2024-08-27,support,The shoe's support features get the job done. I never had any hiccups with support and lockdown.
1655,32,3,7.5,2024-09-19,support,The support is decent but isn't as supportive as the Freak 5. I'm unsure how long the upper will remain intact structurally.
1656,32,10,7.0,2024-09-15,support,"The upper material could be better for containment. Lateral support could be better, too. The performance is adequate overall."
1657,32,6,8.0,2024-09-23,support,"I experienced some heel slippage. It's not too uncomfortable, and the rest of the support is solid."
1658,32,20,7.0,2025-02-15,support,"The forefoot lacks support features, but the heel lockdown is acceptable. Stability is solid. However, there is no torsional plate."
1659,32,1,7.0,2024-08-24,support,"Heel slippage is minor, and there's not much available for lateral stability. I do like the heel counter, though."
1660,32,32,9.0,2024-08-24,fit,Fit is flexible and comfortable thanks to the materials.
1661,32,7,9.0,2024-08-27,fit,"The fit feels very snug, almost 1-to-1. It feels sculpted around the ankle collar, which I enjoy."
1662,32,3,8.0,2024-09-19,fit,The fit is comfortable. I was fine with the length and width.
1663,32,10,9.0,2024-09-15,fit,The shoe fits me like a glove.
1664,32,6,8.0,2024-09-23,fit,"The fit is a bit long, but it doesn't affect performance."
1665,32,20,9.0,2025-02-15,fit,The shoe is easy to put on and has an adjustable fit. Fit and comfort are among the best features.
1666,32,1,6.0,2024-08-24,fit,"I was disappointed with the fit. It's slightly long, and the toe box tapers heavily."
1667,32,7,50.0,2024-08-27,outdoor,The rubber feels firm enough for outdoors.
1668,32,3,50.0,2024-09-19,outdoor,The XDR version is decent for outdoor pairs.

1682,33,33,8.8,2024-09-21,expert_overall,"The Curry 12 is the best overall performer in his lineup. This pair blew my mind. The cushioning is improved, while the support and traction remain fantastic."
1683,33,3,8.6,2024-09-29,expert_overall,"The Curry 12 is an impressive performer. Flow foam provides excellent traction, and the materials are comfortable and supportive."
1684,33,10,8.4,2024-09-21,expert_overall,"The Curry 12 is extremely light and performs similarly to the Curry 11. The traction plays well on clean courts, and the cushioning is best for responsiveness."
1685,33,1,8.3,2024-09-21,expert_overall,The Curry 12 performance is similar to the 11 but is more comfortable. The fit and upper materials are much improved.
1686,33,6,8.2,2024-09-21,expert_overall,You should know what to expect with a Curry shoe. The Curry 12 is in line with the rest of the Flow lineup. I love the performance on clean courts.
1687,33,71,8.2,2024-10-10,user_overall,My first Curry/Under Armour Basketball shoes this one. Performance wise I find these ok but not great. In terms of looks though I think they are great.

1853,36,3,8.0,2024-06-23,materials,"I like how lightweight the shoe feels. The materials are innovative and softer than I expected. The downsides are the upper is prone to creasing, and the breathability is not the best."
1854,36,10,8.0,2024-08-03,materials,The leather-like material requires no break-in time. It conforms to my feet nicely. The only downside is the lack of ventilation.
1855,36,2,8.0,2024-08-06,materials,"The upper doesn't require any break-in time. The shoe feels comfortable immediately. Breathability is a downside, though. The shoe gets warm."

1859,36,20,9.0,2024-07-12,materials,"The materials are comfortable but not breathable. I like how the upper feels, and how secure the construction makes my foot feel."
1860,36,1,9.0,2024-06-23,support,"There's zero heel slippage after an initial break-in period, mainly because of the substantial heel counter."
1861,36,7,10.0,2025-01-02,support,"This is one of, if not the most, secure shoe I ever tested. It feels like a straightjacket on my feet."
1862,36,3,9.0,2024-06-23,support,Your foot feels secure in the shell. You're covered for support and stability.
1863,36,10,9.0,2024-08-03,support,I was good to go with support and lockdown. The lateral containment is also outstanding thanks to the upper materials.
1864,36,2,9.0,2024-08-06,support,"The upper materials and construction provide plenty of lateral support and containment. The shoe is cozy and contained around the ankle, too."
1865,36,9,10.0,2024-09-15,support,I like the torsional support and had zero issues with support and stability. You feel stable thanks to the base width.

1873,36,2,7.0,2024-08-06,fit,The fit is the only downside. The shoe is easy to put on my feet but feels snug around the midfoot. The forefoot also feels long.

1878,36,1,50.0,2024-06-23,outdoor,The rubber is soft but durable. I still think the depth is too low for outdoor play.
1879,36,7,0.0,2025-01-02,outdoor,The grooves are too shallow for outdoor play.
1880,36,3,0.0,2024-06-23,outdoor,I'm not sure the rubber will hold up for outdoors.

1889,36,8,2,2024-07-15,width,My pinky toe went numb from the snug width. I recommend going up half a size if you have a wide foot.

1898,37,6,8.6,2024-07-25,expert_overall,I enjoyed playing in the Adidas D.O.N Issue 6. The shoe features phenomenal traction and solid impact protection. My only issue is the minor heel slippage.

1902,37,1,8.3,2024-07-15,expert_overall,The Adidas D.O.N. Issue 6 offers elite balance. The shoe is light and the traction is impressive for surefooted players. The main downside is the lack of snap and springiness.
1903,37,83,8.8,2024-12-25,user_overall,Personally I think the shoe has high potential I went half a size up and I had some issues with the heel slippage and the shoe kept digging in

1910,37,9,10.0,2024-11-14,traction,The traction covers you in all directions. It's one of the best setups I've tried.
1911,37,3,10.0,2024-09-03,traction,"Traction performance is top-tier. It picks up dust easily, but I had no issues after wiping it."

1914,37,10,8.0,2024-07-15,cushion,"The cushioning feels nice during play, but not from a regular step-in comfort perspective. I like the compression and impact protection of the foam."
1915,37,9,8.0,2024-11-14,cushion,The cushioning feels good if you don't need much impact protection. This setup is low and bouncy.
1916,37,3,8.0,2024-09-03,cushion,"The forefoot cushioning is mediocre, but the heel cushioning is surprisingly responsive. It feels decent overall."
1917,37,1,8.0,2024-07-15,cushion,"There's a Lightstrike Pro pad under the forefoot. The rest of the foam is regular Lightstrike. The foam provides impact protection, but it feels dull and not bouncy."
1918,37,6,8.0,2024-07-25,materials,"The textile upper feels like an engineered mesh, and the tongue is adequately padded. It gets the job done."

1922,37,1,9.0,2024-07-15,materials,Adidas did not skimp on the volume of material on the upper. It's substantial and well-padded. I also like the padding layer around the lace line.

1924,37,10,8.0,2024-07-15,support,The support and lockdown are surprisingly good for how light the shoe is.

1934,37,9,0.0,2024-11-14,outdoor,This outsole is not meant for outdoors.
1935,37,1,0.0,2024-07-15,outdoor,The tread is too narrow for outdoor play. There isn't enough surface area for the traction to be ideal outdoors.
1936,37,9,2,2024-11-14,width,"Wide-footers may need to go up half a size. The materials do break in, though."
1937,37,3,2,2024-09-03,width,"If you have wider feet, go up half a size. Beware of potential heel slippage if you size up."
1938,37,1,3,2024-07-15,width,2E feet can go true to size for a performance fit or up half a size for a roomier fit.

1943,38,7,9.2,2024-07-19,expert_overall,I love the performance of the Nike Sabrina 2. The traction and cushioning performance are outstanding. Beware of potential quality control issues. I experienced some peeling on my first pair.
1944,38,6,8.6,2024-07-19,expert_overall,The Nike Sabrina 2 is a solid performer. It reminds me of the Nike Kobe 5. The traction is fantastic; the only downside is the lack of impact protection.
1945,38,86,8.5,2024-07-15,expert_overall,"The Nike Sabrina 2 is lighter without losing support, stability, or comfort. The new Cushlon 3.0 midsole feels more plush as well."

1953,38,8,8.2,2024-07-15,expert_overall,The Nike Sabrina 2 feels like a budget Kobe. The shoe reminds me of the Kobe 5 with how the traction and cushioning feel.
1954,38,39,9.2,2024-11-24,user_overall,"It’s a good shoe, traction top tier, had a little slipping when i first bought them but got way better the day after. A little wide which is perfect for me as I am a wide footer. If u do have flat feet like me and wear insoles for them I suggest going your true size, it squeezes going in your ankle a lot and hurts a lot. Other than that you should go half a size down. The outsole starts to peel a little so that’s a tiny bit worrying but other than that the shoe is really good."
1955,38,87,9.4,2024-09-11,user_overall,"The Sabrina 2 is a great performer with amazing looks. It feels low to the ground, but doesn’t sacrifice significant cushion. I’d say it’s more of a guard/forward shoe, because of the cushion not being top-notch. Overall I would heavily recommend this shoe to basketball players, especially the ones that like Kobe’s. The shoe felt very similar to what you would get from a kobe shoe."
1956,38,40,8.7,2025-07-10,user_overall,Everything about the shoe is amazing but the cushion isn’t awesome especially when you are standing around. It maxes your hells uncomfortable but otherwise this shoe feels awesome if feels just like a Kobe 5 but 200 dollars cheaper and I highly recommend it for any position on the court
1957,38,88,9.3,2025-01-14,user_overall,"imagine wearing 90% of kobe 5, its not he best but still worth the money"

1962,38,5,9.0,2024-07-15,traction,The herringbone traction is proven and it works. It feels more aggressive than the Sabrina 1.

1970,38,7,9.5,2024-07-19,cushion,Cushlon 3.0 feels plush underfoot. The top-loaded Zoom unit in the forefoot feels springy as well. The performance is superb.
1971,38,6,8.0,2024-07-19,cushion,The inner Cushlon 3.0 foam feels nice. It leans less toward impact protection and more toward responsiveness.
1972,38,86,8.0,2024-07-15,cushion,The Cushlon 3.0 midsole offers more impact protection than React foam while keeping the shoe agile. The setup is best for shiftier guards.
1973,38,5,8.0,2024-07-15,cushion,The cushioning feels similar to the first shoe. The Cushlon 3.0 foam starts stiff but moulds to your feet nicely.

1977,38,9,8.0,2024-08-18,cushion,"The low cushioning is great for shifty guards, but won't perform well for players who need more impact protection."
1978,38,1,8.0,2024-07-15,cushion,I like the double-thickness shank in the cushioning. The Cushlon 3.0 feels comfortable and plush. This setup feels lively and bouncy.
1979,38,33,7.0,2024-07-15,cushion,"The foam is different, but it feels similar. The Cushlon 3.0 has some spring, but it feels lightweight without being plush."
1980,38,8,8.0,2024-07-15,cushion,"The Cushlon 3.0 feels comfortable, but you must break in the forefoot to feel the Zoom unit. The setup still feels low to the ground."

1989,38,1,8.0,2024-07-15,materials,"I like the bunting and padding around the ankle and heel counter. The breathability isn't the best, though."
1990,38,33,8.0,2024-07-15,materials,The materials are all textiles. It feels broken in and comfortable immediately.
1991,38,8,8.0,2024-07-15,materials,The materials are lightweight and accommodating. It feels flexible and comfortable.

1999,38,9,9.0,2024-08-18,support,I like the support features and the addition of a new shank plate. I had no issues with the support and felt safe.
2000,38,1,9.0,2024-07-15,support,"The lockdown around the heel is outstanding. The cables Nike includes around the midfoot keep you locked in, and the midfoot shank keeps you supported."
2001,38,33,8.0,2024-07-15,support,"I felt stable in this shoe. The shank could be beefed up, though."
2002,38,8,8.0,2024-07-15,support,There are no issues with the support and lockdown.
2003,38,7,10.0,2024-07-19,fit,The forefoot is a lot more forgiving this year. It's a 1-to-1 fitting basketball shoe.
2004,38,6,8.0,2024-07-19,fit,The fit is decent. There's a bit of extra length.

2011,38,1,8.0,2024-07-15,fit,"The fit is my favourite part of the shoe. The shoe has a lot of functional space you can use, and you can zero in the lockdown."
2012,38,33,9.0,2024-07-15,fit,The upper fit and secured my foot well. I like how stable I felt.
2013,38,8,9.0,2024-07-15,fit,The fit is slightly improved. I had a better experience playing in this model than the previous one.
2014,38,7,0.0,2024-07-19,outdoor,My only gripe for the traction is the durability.
2015,38,5,50.0,2024-07-15,outdoor,The sneaker is better suited for indoors.
2016,38,10,50.0,2024-07-15,outdoor,The durability feels decent.
2017,38,2,0.0,2024-07-22,outdoor,"I would not recommend this pair outdoors, mainly because of the cushioning."
2018,38,9,0.0,2024-08-18,outdoor,I don't think this outsole will last long outdoors.
2019,38,1,50.0,2024-07-15,outdoor,I enjoyed playing in this pair outdoors. They'll last if you can get the XDR pairs.
2020,38,8,0.0,2024-07-15,outdoor,This is not the most durable rubber. My pair started fraying after indoor play only.
2021,38,5,2,2024-07-15,width,The shoe feels slightly narrow.
2022,38,10,3,2024-07-15,width,The width feels normal.
2023,38,3,3,2024-08-07,width,The width is accommodating.
2024,38,9,3,2024-08-18,width,The width is much more accommodating on the Sabrina 2.
2025,38,1,3,2024-07-15,width,2E feet can go true to size for a performance fit or up half a size for a roomier fit. The width feels normal.
2026,38,8,3,2024-07-15,width,The width is more accommodating.
2027,38,6,2,2024-07-19,size,I went up half a size.
2028,38,5,3,2024-07-15,size,"In my opinion, the shoe is true to size."
2029,38,10,3,2024-07-15,size,"I went up half a size, but you can go true to size."
2030,38,2,3,2024-07-22,size,"Get your regular size, but try on in-store if possible."
2031,38,3,3,2024-08-07,size,The fit is true to size.
2032,38,9,3,2024-08-18,size,I recommend going true to size if you have regular feet.
2033,38,1,3,2024-07-15,size,Narrow and medium feet can go true to size.
2034,38,8,3,2024-07-15,size,I went true to size.
2035,39,7,9.1,2024-07-19,expert_overall,This is a fantastic hoop shoe. The Nike GT Hustle 3 is a perfect shoe for players who like plush cushioning. It offers some of Nike's best tech from cushioning to support and materials.
2036,39,33,8.4,2024-07-19,expert_overall,"The Nike GT Hustle 3 feels like an elevated running shoe meant for basketball. The traction and cushioning are fantastic, and I like how Nike built the upper."
2037,39,6,8.4,2024-08-03,expert_overall,The Nike GT Hustle 3 has an insane amount of cushioning and reliable traction. This is a perfect shoe for players who want impact protection.
2038,39,2,8.4,2024-08-13,expert_overall,The Nike GT Hustle 3 is an amazing basketball sneaker. I highly recommend this for bigger players. The impact protection and cushioning are outstanding.
2039,39,9,8.3,2024-08-11,expert_overall,"The Nike GT Hustle 3 is a solid performer if impact protection is your top priority. The containment and stack height can be an issue, but the traction performance is also great."
2040,39,1,8.2,2024-07-15,expert_overall,The Nike GT Hustle 3 is an easy shoe to play in. It gets off the ground easily because of the cushioning setup and the shank. My only concern is the stability.
2041,39,10,8.0,2024-08-03,expert_overall,"The Nike GT Hustle 3 has ample cushioning and reliable traction. However, the lack of stability hurts, and the cushion can be excessive."

2046,39,7,9.0,2024-07-19,traction,"You'll be good to go on clean floors, and the rubber sticks like glue. On dirty floors, make sure to wipe the dust off."
2047,39,33,9.0,2024-07-19,traction,The traction performance feels great. It's likely because of the gum rubber compound.
2048,39,6,8.0,2024-08-03,traction,The traction performance is surprisingly good. I had a strong grip on clean courts and didn't experience any sliding on dusty courts.
2049,39,2,8.0,2024-08-13,traction,The traction performance feels nice. It feels consistent and the grip is solid.
2050,39,9,9.0,2024-08-11,traction,The traction performs very well. The grip is impressive. I especially like the gum setup.
2051,39,1,8.0,2024-07-15,traction,"I like how the lateral cutout performs. The traction performance feels stable, especially during lateral cuts. Speed is not an issue, cornering could be."
2052,39,10,8.0,2024-08-03,traction,"Performance on clean courts is solid. It gets better and better the more you play. I experienced some dust pickup, though."
2053,39,7,9.0,2024-07-19,cushion,The React midsole feels plush but rides high. Impact protection is fantastic. The double-stacked Zoom Air setup is bouncy and plush as well.
2054,39,33,9.0,2024-07-19,cushion,"The cushioning is the shoe's best feature, but the stack height is not for everybody. The insole and midsole are incredibly plush, and the double-stacked Zoom feels insane."
2055,39,6,10.0,2024-08-03,cushion,"The cushioning setup feels insane. There's plenty of impact protection and the heel feels plush. It has maximum bounce, too."
2056,39,2,10.0,2024-08-13,cushion,I like the insole. It has outstanding step-in comfort. The Zoom in the forefoot is incredibly bouncy.
2057,39,9,10.0,2024-08-11,cushion,The cushioning setup is insanely comfortable. It's the shoe's best feature. It might be excessive for players who prefer responsiveness.
2058,39,1,9.5,2024-07-15,cushion,You sit high off the ground. The React foam isn't bouncy but the Zoom units under the forefoot make up for it.
2059,39,10,9.0,2024-08-03,cushion,"The cushioning setup feels bouncy and explosive. It's almost too much cushioning and compression, and the court feel is non-existent."
2060,39,7,9.5,2024-07-19,materials,"I enjoy the materials on the shoe. It's a mesh upper that feels strong and breathable. There was no break-in time, and I felt comfortable right away."
2061,39,33,8.0,2024-07-19,materials,"The materials are Flyknit, and it feels light and breathable. I like the construction of the upper."
2062,39,6,8.0,2024-08-03,materials,I think the materials are nice and feel good on my feet.
2063,39,2,8.0,2024-08-13,materials,"The materials hold up well and are comfortable, but it feels flimsier than expected."
2064,39,9,8.0,2024-08-11,materials,"The materials are light and thin, but containment might be an issue. I like the quality and comfort, though."
2065,39,1,8.0,2024-07-15,materials,"The upper materials look and feel substantial. It feels breathable, especially if the insole is out. The materials aren't the most durable, though."
2066,39,10,9.0,2024-08-03,materials,I like the knit upper. It feels thin and lightweight. The shoe is also well-ventilated.
2067,39,7,9.5,2024-07-19,support,"I had no issues with the support. The heel counter is sturdy and rigid, and the upper is strong enough to keep you secure. My only concern is a high stack of cushioning."
2068,39,33,8.0,2024-07-19,support,The upper support is decent. It's good enough to get the job done. Make sure to get the right fit.
2069,39,6,8.0,2024-08-03,support,"I didn't have issues with heel slippage, but I did have some with containment on the footbed. I never rolled over, though."
2070,39,2,8.0,2024-08-13,support,The upper performs well for lateral stability.
2071,39,9,6.5,2024-08-11,support,The support is decent considering how high they are off the ground. The issue is the material containment.
2072,39,1,7.5,2024-07-15,support,"Heel slippage is non-existent. The heel counter offers extra rearfoot stability, but the containment will be tough for people without strong balance."
2073,39,10,6.0,2024-08-03,support,Support and lockdown could be better. I wish the shoe included a lateral counter in the forefoot because I didn't feel laterally stable.
2074,39,7,8.5,2024-07-19,fit,The fit is very snug. It took me about 2 hours to break in. I enjoyed it afterwards.
2075,39,33,8.0,2024-07-19,fit,The fit feels super snug. There's no wiggle room whatsoever. The upper may stretch over time.
2076,39,6,8.0,2024-08-03,fit,The fit is extremely snug. It breaks in a bit but feels slightly short as well.
2077,39,2,8.0,2024-08-13,fit,I didn't have issues with the fit.
2078,39,9,8.0,2024-08-11,fit,The materials will help the fit get better for wide feet.
2079,39,1,8.0,2024-07-15,fit,The fit can be odd. It feels slightly short with a standard width.
2080,39,10,8.0,2024-08-03,fit,The fit runs short and the shoe feels snug.
2081,39,7,50.0,2024-07-19,outdoor,"The compound feels firm and the grooves are deep enough, but I'm hesitant to take these outdoors."
2082,39,2,50.0,2024-08-13,outdoor,"The treads are deep, but the rubber material feels soft."
2083,39,9,0.0,2024-08-11,outdoor,I don't recommend these shoes for outdoor play.
2084,39,10,50.0,2024-08-03,outdoor,Outdoor performance seems okay.
2085,39,6,2,2024-08-03,width,I have a slightly wide foot. The width is somewhat narrow.
2086,39,2,2,2024-08-13,width,"If you have wide feet, go half a size up."
2087,39,9,3,2024-08-11,width,"After a break-in period, the upper stretches and conforms nicely to my wide feet."
2088,39,1,2,2024-07-15,width,2E feet can go up half a size.
2089,39,10,2,2024-08-03,width,The width is narrow.
2090,39,6,3,2024-08-03,size,I went true to size. I recommend going up half a size if you have wide feet.
2091,39,2,3,2024-08-13,size,"If you have narrow or medium feet, go true to size."
2092,39,9,3,2024-08-11,size,I recommend going true to size.
2093,39,1,3,2024-07-15,size,Narrow and medium feet can go true to size.
2094,39,10,2,2024-08-03,size,I recommend going up a half size.
2095,40,7,7.4,2024-08-06,expert_overall,I think you're getting hosed with the Nike GT Hustle Academy. There's not enough tech to offer much performance.
2096,40,33,7.0,2024-08-06,expert_overall,The Nike GT Hustle Academy is a head-scratcher. There's no tech in the cushioning and support features. The only upside is the lightweight feeling and decent traction.
2097,40,10,6.8,2024-08-13,expert_overall,The Nike GT Hustle Academy is minimal and lightweight but sacrifices too much to get there. There's no cushioning and a lack of support features.
2098,40,1,6.6,2024-08-06,expert_overall,"The Nike GT Hustle Academy feels light and breezy and has a solid grip. However, the lack of cushioning, support, and durability is too much to overcome."
2099,40,7,9.0,2024-08-06,traction,You'll be good to go through most movements. The performance was impressive on clean courts. Wipe the outsole on dusty courts.
2100,40,33,8.0,2024-08-06,traction,"The traction performance feels similar to the Hustle 3 but is less tacky. It works well, especially in linear movements."
2101,40,10,8.0,2024-08-13,traction,"You have a solid bite, especially on clean courts. However, the performance is bad, but not terrible, on dust. I didn't experience dangerous sliding, but the stop wasn't the best."
2102,40,1,8.0,2024-08-06,traction,The radial pattern offers you a confident grip.
2103,40,7,5.0,2024-08-06,cushion,"Cushioning is the shoe's biggest letdown. The foam feels dead. It has a bit of impact protection under the heel, but your forefoot is close to the floor."
2104,40,33,6.0,2024-08-06,cushion,The cushioning feels cheap and basic. My legs felt tired after playing in this shoe.
2105,40,10,5.0,2024-08-13,cushion,The cushioning setup is terrible. There's no impact protection whatsoever. It hurt my feet on landings and heel strikes.
2106,40,1,5.0,2024-08-06,cushion,"The dual-density foams feel similar to each other. You feel low to the ground, but there is no liveliness. The shoe also doesn't offer much shock absorption, so you feel the impact in your legs."
2107,40,7,6.5,2024-08-06,materials,"The materials are also a letdown. The Flyknit feels more like a mesh with TPU strands throughout. It offers a lot of breathability, but it feels cheap."
2108,40,33,8.0,2024-08-06,materials,The Flyknit feels good. It's breathable and the shoe requires no break-in time.
2109,40,10,7.0,2024-08-13,materials,"The upper materials aren't bad. You can't complain because of the price, but it does feel cheap."
2110,40,1,8.0,2024-08-06,materials,The materials make the shoe one of the lightest available. Flyknit makes the upper breathable and airy.
2111,40,7,8.0,2024-08-06,support,I don't have anything to harp on for the support. The support features get the job done.
2112,40,33,6.0,2024-08-06,support,There's nothing in the shoe to boost support. Torsional support sucks.
2113,40,10,6.0,2024-08-13,support,"The torsional support is non-existent. My foot didn't feel supported in this shoe. Lateral containment is decent, though."
2114,40,1,5.0,2024-08-06,support,"The heel counter feels flimsy, and there isn't much torsional stability."
2115,40,7,8.5,2024-08-06,fit,The fit feels decent after a break-in period. It's snug and close to being 1-to-1.
2116,40,33,7.0,2024-08-06,fit,"The fit is extremely snug, even for my liking. There's no wiggle room at all."
2117,40,10,8.0,2024-08-13,fit,I like the way the shoe fits. The toe box is snug and thin.
2118,40,1,7.0,2024-08-06,fit,"The last is incredibly straight, but the fit feels long."
2119,40,7,50.0,2024-08-06,outdoor,I think you can take this pair outdoors because of the firm rubber.
2120,40,10,50.0,2024-08-13,outdoor,You should be fine on outdoor courts.
2121,40,1,0.0,2024-08-06,outdoor,The tread isn't meant for outdoor play.
2122,40,1,3,2024-08-06,width,The width is standard. 2E feet can go true to size.
2123,40,10,2,2024-08-13,size,I went up half a size.
2124,40,1,4,2024-08-06,size,People with narrow or medium feet with short toes can go down half a size. Regular medium feet can go true to size.
2125,41,7,8.9,2024-09-22,expert_overall,The Li-Ning Wade 808 4 Ultra is an incredibly supportive shoe with a fantastic drop-in midsole. I also enjoyed the traction performance. This shoe is a great value.
2126,41,1,8.8,2024-08-06,expert_overall,There is so much packed into the Li-Ning Wade 808 4 Ultra. The materials and cushioning help you get off the floor and move side-to-side quickly.
2127,41,10,8.6,2024-08-06,expert_overall,"The Wade 808 4 Ultra is an incredibly balanced shoe. The upper is minimal, I love the cushioning, and the traction is elite. My only complaint is the heel area feels clunky."
2128,41,3,8.6,2024-08-11,expert_overall,"The Li-Ning Wade 808 4 Ultra is the best shoe in the 808 line. The materials and the cushioning are the best features, but the shoe is also lightweight and comfortable."
2129,41,8,8.6,2024-08-19,expert_overall,"The Li-Ning Wade 808 4 Ultra is an incredible performer. The drop-in midsole is outstanding, and the traction performs well. My only gripe is the hollowed-out sections on the outsole. I prefer full coverage."
2130,41,6,8.6,2024-11-22,expert_overall,"I think the Wade 808 4 Ultra is a banger of a shoe. Once you break in the traction, the performance is outstanding. I love the Boom midsole setup, too."

2134,41,7,8.5,2024-09-22,traction,The performance on clean courts feels great. I find it collects some dust on dirty floors but I never slipped out.
2135,41,1,10.0,2024-08-06,traction,The rubber is forgiving. It's meant to move with you. I didn't have any problems on indoor courts.
2136,41,10,10.0,2024-08-06,traction,The rubber compound provides an amazing bite. The traction is top-tier after a few games.
2137,41,3,10.0,2024-08-11,traction,This shoe's traction performance is elite.
2138,41,8,9.0,2024-08-19,traction,"The traction performs very well, even on dust. I'm not a fan of the hollowed pattern, though."
2139,41,6,9.0,2024-11-22,traction,"The traction performance requires a break-in period, but afterwards, it grips hard. I didn't have issues with dusty courts either."
2140,41,7,10.0,2024-09-22,cushion,"Once the midsole breaks in, the Boom foam is springy and outstanding. I love what Li-Ning is doing with Boom."
2141,41,1,10.0,2024-08-06,cushion,"The drop-in isn't crazy, but it's substantial in stack height. The support is solid under your feet and the bounce is also impressive."
2142,41,10,9.0,2024-08-06,cushion,I love the drop-in Boom midsole. It's one of my favourite foams on the market. The step-in comfort feels nice.
2143,41,3,8.0,2024-08-11,cushion,"The drop-in Boom midsole provides impact protection and bounciness. The performance is solid, even though I don't enjoy drop-in midsoles."
2144,41,8,10.0,2024-08-19,cushion,"The drop-in midsole is much thicker, more comfortable, and bouncier."
2145,41,6,10.0,2024-11-22,cushion,"The drop-in Boom midsole is outstanding. It's comfortable, soft, and bouncy, making this setup perfect."
2146,41,7,8.0,2024-09-22,materials,"The materials are nothing special and quite cheap. I enjoy the free-flowing feeling the performance provides, though."
2147,41,1,8.0,2024-08-06,materials,"The upper has so much going on. The elastic strap helps with containment, and the tongue gusset is aggressive. The materials are TPU and textiles. It feels comfortable."
2148,41,10,7.0,2024-08-06,materials,"The upper feels flimsy and cheap for the price. It's thin and lightweight, which I enjoy."
2149,41,3,9.0,2024-08-11,materials,Materials are a key area of improvement. It's a lot softer and more cozy.
2150,41,8,8.0,2024-08-19,materials,The materials are lightweight and feel nice on my feet. I like how supportive it feels without being rigid.
2151,41,6,8.0,2024-11-22,materials,The materials feel strong and they conform to your foot nicely.
2152,41,7,9.0,2024-09-22,support,"This is a very supportive basketball shoe. There's a ton of support at the back of the shoe, and the lateral containment is impressive."
2153,41,1,8.0,2024-08-06,support,You have to break in the shoe to avoid heel slippage. Lateral stability is fantastic in this shoe.
2154,41,10,9.0,2024-08-06,support,"I like the strap implementation. The support and lockdown performance is great, especially laterally."
2155,41,3,8.0,2024-08-11,support,The strap is decently functional. The support also feels comfortable.
2156,41,8,8.0,2024-08-19,support,"Lockdown is impressive, even without the strap."
2157,41,6,8.0,2024-11-22,support,"My heel felt contained, and the side-to-side containment was solid. I had no issues with the support."
2158,41,7,9.0,2024-09-22,fit,"My break-in period was painful because of the containment features. Otherwise, the fit feels secure and locked down, which I loved."
2159,41,1,8.0,2024-08-06,fit,Break the shoes in around the house before you play in them.
2160,41,10,8.0,2024-08-06,fit,The shoe is slightly long. It's narrow and snug in the toe box.
2161,41,3,8.0,2024-08-11,fit,I went up half a size to get a decent fit and avoid pinching.
2162,41,8,8.0,2024-08-19,fit,I like the way this shoe fits. It's more comfortable.
2163,41,6,8.0,2024-11-22,fit,I didn't have any issues with the fit. I felt snug and secure.
2164,41,7,0.0,2024-09-22,outdoor,"I like the rubber compound, but the grooves are shallow."
2165,41,1,0.0,2024-08-06,outdoor,These are indoor shoes to me.
2166,41,10,50.0,2024-08-06,outdoor,The rubber is thick enough for outdoor play.
2167,41,3,50.0,2024-08-11,outdoor,The rubber should be durable enough for outdoor play.
2168,41,1,3,2024-08-06,width,The width is standard. 2E feet can go true to size for a performance fit or up half a size for a roomier fit.
2169,41,8,3,2024-08-19,width,"If you have a wide foot, go up half a size."
2170,41,6,3,2024-11-22,width,My slightly wide foot felt okay in this shoe.

2173,41,3,2,2024-08-11,size,I went up half a size.
2174,41,8,2,2024-08-19,size,I recommend going half a size up.
2175,41,6,3,2024-11-22,size,I would say the shoe runs true to size.
2176,42,10,8.6,2024-06-14,expert_overall,The Nike Kobe 8 Protro is a responsive shoe. I feel quick because of the top-tier traction and support. I wish Nike upgraded the cushioning more.
2177,42,8,8.6,2024-07-15,expert_overall,"The Nike Kobe 8 Protro is a lightweight, minimal shoe. The traction performs very well, but the cushioning is not geared for impact protection. The shoe is better suited for shifty guards."
2178,42,6,8.6,2024-09-05,expert_overall,"The Nike Kobe 8 Protro is a great pair to play in. The traction is impressive, and I enjoy the React cushioning setup."
2179,42,9,8.6,2025-02-23,expert_overall,"I love how supportive, lightweight, and grippy the Nike Kobe Protro 8 feels. The traction is excellent, and the heel counter keeps you contained."
2180,42,7,8.1,2024-06-14,expert_overall,"I'm not impressed by the improvements to the Nike Kobe 8 Protro. The cushioning could be better, but the traction and support are outstanding."
2181,42,1,7.6,2024-06-14,expert_overall,The Nike Kobe 8 Protro allows a lot of movement freedom and contortion. Lighter players who don't require impact protection will get the most out of this shoe.
2182,42,94,8.6,2024-11-02,user_overall,"Traction is super grippy on all courts and rarely needs wiping.Cushion have great court feel but react foam needs break in to be more soft, ok bounce, and impact protection could be better. Materials take a decent amount of break in time to be less tight, but after broken in they’re light, breathable and supportive. The support is great because of the carbon fiber plate and heel counter. Fit is very narrow at first but after 5 or 6 wares it loosens up."
2183,42,95,8.8,2024-06-26,user_overall,Really good option just pick thick socks which are not to wide because the insole will stick to it like glue

2187,42,10,10.0,2024-06-14,traction,"The traction performance is freaking amazing. The stop and the bite are incredible on clean courts, and I wasn't affected by dust."
2188,42,8,10.0,2024-07-15,traction,The traction works very well. The rubber is sticky almost instantaneously.
2189,42,6,9.0,2024-09-05,traction,"The traction performance is great. You're going to have no issues, especially on cleaner courts."
2190,42,9,10.0,2025-02-23,traction,The traction meets my high expectations. It bites extremely well on indoor courts.
2191,42,7,9.0,2024-06-14,traction,"The traction performance is fantastic on clean courts. You'll have to wipe on dirty courts, but the performance holds up well."
2192,42,1,8.0,2024-06-14,traction,The traction performs well after the rubber gets warm.
2193,42,10,8.0,2024-06-14,cushion,"I prefer more springiness. The React foam feels softer than the older Lunarlon setup. Impact protection isn't the best. I love the court feel, though."
2194,42,8,7.0,2024-07-15,cushion,The React drop-in midsole feels firm. It doesn't offer much impact protection and feels minimal.
2195,42,6,9.0,2024-09-05,cushion,"The React drop-in midsole has decent impact protection, but the setup caters more to responsiveness. It feels perfect for my personal needs."
2196,42,9,8.0,2025-02-23,cushion,"The React drop-in is low to the ground and responsive, but there isn't much impact protection. I would not recommend this setup for bigger players."
2197,42,7,7.0,2024-06-14,cushion,"The cushioning is somewhat of a letdown. The React drop-in is thin, especially under the forefoot. It offers an impressive court feel, but I would like more cushioning."
2198,42,1,7.0,2024-06-14,cushion,The React midsole feels light and feathery but also flimsy.
2199,42,10,8.0,2024-06-14,materials,The materials are thin but comfortable.
2200,42,8,8.0,2024-07-15,materials,"The materials feel stiff, but feel better after a break-in period. It gets the job done afterwards."
2201,42,6,8.0,2024-09-05,materials,"The materials feel crispy, but it breaks in easily. I wish they used more premium materials. The upper gets the job done."
2202,42,9,8.0,2025-02-23,materials,"The materials are nothing special. They do a good job, and are lightweight and breathable."
2203,42,7,7.5,2024-06-14,materials,The synthetic materials are nothing special. I like that the mesh is breathable and durable.
2204,42,1,8.0,2024-06-14,materials,"The upper was not as breathable as expected. However, the heat retention is not affected. I like how the upper moulds to my feet, though."
2205,42,10,9.0,2024-06-14,support,"I had zero issues with the support and lockdown. I would've felt better with more of a sidewall, but that's a personal preference."
2206,42,8,9.0,2024-07-15,support,"The support feels good, especially the heel counter. It caters well to fast, shifty guards."
2207,42,6,8.0,2024-09-05,support,I had no issues with the support. I like the heel counter and the side-to-side stability.
2208,42,9,9.0,2025-02-23,support,I like the heel counter and torsional shank plate. The support and containment are excellent.
2209,42,7,9.0,2024-06-14,support,The support is one of the standout features. All positions can benefit from the lockdown and security of the Kobe 8.
2210,42,1,7.0,2024-06-14,support,I love the external heel counter for stability. Heel slippage is non-existent. The lack of rails on the drop-in midsole can cause your foot to roll over.
2211,42,10,8.0,2024-06-14,fit,"The width is narrow, but the length is roomy. I felt alright with the fit."
2212,42,8,9.0,2024-07-15,fit,True to size feels good to me. It fits close to perfect.
2213,42,6,9.0,2024-09-05,fit,"The materials break in nicely, but the forefoot feels snug. It feels close to 1-to-1 for me."
2214,42,9,8.0,2025-02-23,fit,The fit is a bit tricky. It takes time to break in because of the narrow width.
2215,42,7,8.0,2024-06-14,fit,"I experienced some pinching near the outrigger. It makes the shoe feel narrow before breaking in. The toe box is fairly roomy, too."
2216,42,1,8.0,2024-06-14,fit,The fit is slightly short and narrow.
2217,42,10,0.0,2024-06-14,outdoor,The rubber on this shoe is not a good option for outdoors.
2218,42,8,0.0,2024-07-15,outdoor,"The rubber is firm and rigid, but I wouldn't recommend taking these shoes outdoors."
2219,42,9,50.0,2025-02-23,outdoor,I think you can wear this pair outdoors.
2220,42,7,0.0,2024-06-14,outdoor,I don't think I would take this pair outdoors.
2221,42,1,50.0,2024-06-14,outdoor,My version has a solid rubber outsole. It can perform decently outdoors.
2222,42,8,3,2024-07-15,width,I like the width. It's not too narrow.
2223,42,6,2,2024-09-05,width,The forefoot is narrow.
2224,42,9,2,2025-02-23,width,The shape is narrow.
2225,42,7,1,2024-06-14,width,The fit is extremely narrow.
2226,42,1,2,2024-06-14,width,The shoe feels narrow. 2E feet can go up 1 size.
2227,42,8,3,2024-07-15,size,I would stay true to size.
2228,42,6,3,2024-09-05,size,The shoe is true to size.
2229,42,9,2,2025-02-23,size,Go true to size if you have narrow feet or up half a size if you have slightly wide feet.
2230,42,7,2,2024-06-14,size,Go up half a size if you have a wide foot.
2231,42,1,3,2024-06-14,size,Narrow and medium feet can go true to size.
2232,43,3,8.4,2024-06-14,expert_overall,"The Nike GT Cut Cross is one of the best budget shoes. I love the traction, but the cushioning is a budget setup."
2233,43,23,8.2,2024-08-03,expert_overall,"The Nike GT Cut Cross is a solid budget shoe and a good option for outdoor play. The traction performance is great, and the upper materials feel improved."
2234,43,1,7.8,2024-06-14,expert_overall,"The Nike GT Cut Cross is a snappy performance shoe. I like how the traction feels, but the cushioning isn't as bouncy as the rest of the GT Cut line."
2235,43,99,8.0,2025-02-16,user_overall,
2236,43,3,10.0,2024-06-14,traction,The traction performance is fantastic. It performs well on dusty courts.
2237,43,23,9.0,2024-08-03,traction,The traction pattern is the same as the GT Cut Academy. The herringbone outsole offers great coverage.
2238,43,1,8.0,2024-06-14,traction,I like the tactile sensation this outsole pattern provides.
2239,43,3,8.0,2024-06-14,cushion,"The cushioning feels the same as the GT Cut Academy. The performance is average at best, but the court feel is solid."
2240,43,23,8.0,2024-08-03,cushion,The forefoot Zoom unit feels comfortable and it works well. The foam is low-profile and reactive.
2241,43,1,7.5,2024-06-14,cushion,The foam feels like full-length Phylon with a forefoot Zoom unit. The setup is more subdued with less bounce.
2242,43,3,8.0,2024-06-14,materials,The materials feel supportive. It feels better than the Academy.
2243,43,23,8.0,2024-08-03,materials,The material setup is significantly better than the Academy. My foot felt contained and the shoe felt lightweight.
2244,43,1,8.0,2024-06-14,materials,"The upper is similar to the Academy, but there are more panels. Heat gets trapped in the padding, though."
2245,43,3,8.0,2024-06-14,support,"I had no issues with heel slippage, stability, or support."
2246,43,23,8.0,2024-08-03,support,"Support features are minimal, but the performance is solid. I didn't have any issues with support or stability."
2247,43,1,8.0,2024-06-14,support,"There's mild to moderate heel slippage. The outsole flange helps with stability, and so does the firmer foam cushioning."
2248,43,3,8.0,2024-06-14,fit,"The fit feels snug, and the toe box is tight, but that's fine."
2249,43,23,8.0,2024-08-03,fit,"The forefoot feels snug, but not enough to hinder performance. I like the close to 1-to-1 feeling."
2250,43,1,7.5,2024-06-14,fit,"I experienced some cramping initially, but the fit breaks in."
2251,43,3,50.0,2024-06-14,outdoor,My XDR outsole seems fine for outdoors.
2252,43,1,0.0,2024-06-14,outdoor,The tread is too thin for prolonged outdoor play.

2255,44,1,8.2,2024-06-23,expert_overall,"The Puma Stewie 3 are surefooted and cater well to low-to-the-ground players. The traction can be better, but I like the material and build-quality setup."
2256,44,100,8.2,2024-06-23,expert_overall,"I had a mostly positive experience playing in the Puma Stewie 3. The traction performs well, especially on clean courts, and the shoe feels comfortable."
2257,44,6,8.0,2024-06-23,expert_overall,"The Puma Stewie 3 is a solid performer. My main concern is the stiff rear outsole. Otherwise, I like the traction on clean courts and the drop-in midsole."
2258,44,10,7.4,2024-06-23,expert_overall,"I had issues with the Puma Stewie 3 because of the traction. It also feels bottom-heavy and clunky. I do like the drop-in midsole and materials, though."
2259,44,1,7.0,2024-06-23,traction,"The tread is incredibly dense. The initial grip works well, but the performance falters when dust gets in the outsole pattern."
2260,44,100,8.0,2024-06-23,traction,"The traction performance is outstanding on clean courts. It also performs well on dusty courts, but the dust does build up."
2261,44,6,8.0,2024-06-23,traction,I didn't have any issues with the traction performance. It performs well on clean courts. Be prepared to wipe on dustier courts.
2262,44,10,6.0,2024-06-23,traction,The traction is poor on dust and decent on indoor courts. Dust pickup affected the performance too much. I experienced too much sliding.
2263,44,1,8.0,2024-06-23,cushion,"The drop-in midsole is dense. The bounciness is not there, but it's meant for balance and containment."
2264,44,100,8.0,2024-06-23,cushion,I had to break in the cushioning over a few games. The drop-in midsole feels firm to start. It softens up but doesn't become bouncy. This is a neutral setup for sure.
2265,44,6,8.0,2024-06-23,cushion,"The drop-in midsole feels nice. The rear outsole is stiff and affects some impact protection, though. The forefoot feels comfortable."
2266,44,10,7.0,2024-06-23,cushion,"The rubber is stiff around the heel, which affects the impact protection. However, I like the drop-in midsole. Step-in comfort and underfoot cushioning are impressive."
2267,44,1,9.0,2024-06-23,materials,"I like the TPU reinforcement on the lateral side of the shoe. The upper and tongue are densely padded. It's not too breathable, though. The build quality is out of this world."
2268,44,100,8.0,2024-06-23,materials,"The materials take a short break-in period. After breaking them in, the shoe feels supportive without being restrictive."
2269,44,6,8.0,2024-06-23,materials,I can't complain about the engineered mesh upper. It's durable and comfortable during play. Quality could be better.
2270,44,10,8.0,2024-06-23,materials,The engineered mesh is lightweight and comfortable. It feels thin but durable.
2271,44,1,9.0,2024-06-23,support,"The upper stability is improved with the TPU piece. Heel slippage is minimal, and the containment is impressive."
2272,44,100,9.0,2024-06-23,support,"The drop-in midsole does have a torsional plate and elevated side walls, which I appreciate. I felt contained on the footbed. I wish there were a more prominent outrigger."
2273,44,6,8.0,2024-06-23,support,"The back of the shoe provides a lot of structure. There's no heel slippage, and I experienced no slippage on the footbed."
2274,44,10,8.0,2024-06-23,support,I like the raised side walls for lateral containment. The lack of an outrigger affects the lateral stability. Lockdown is good overall.
2275,44,1,8.0,2024-06-23,fit,"The length feels standard, and the shoe feels wider over time."
2276,44,100,8.0,2024-06-23,fit,My foot felt well accommodated in this shoe. It felt comfortable during play.
2277,44,6,8.0,2024-06-23,fit,"As long as you convert the sizing correctly, the shoe fits well. I felt good."
2278,44,10,8.0,2024-06-23,fit,"The fit is snug, especially around the toe box."
2279,44,1,0.0,2024-06-23,outdoor,The traction pattern is too thin and dense to work well outdoors.
2280,44,10,0.0,2024-06-23,outdoor,I would not take this pair outdoors. The traction pattern is too close together.
2281,44,6,3,2024-06-23,width,"I'm a slightly wide-footer, and I felt good."
2282,44,10,2,2024-06-23,width,The width is slightly narrow.
2283,44,6,3,2024-06-23,size,The shoe does run true to size.
2284,44,10,2,2024-06-23,size,I went up half a size.
2285,45,7,8.1,2024-05-03,expert_overall,"I want to love the Jordan Zion 3 SE but the fit and traction cause too many problems. The cushioning is impressive and I enjoy the materials, though."
2286,45,6,7.8,2024-05-03,expert_overall,"I can't recommend the Jordan Zion 3 SE because of the lack of traction. All the other features perform well, but it's not enough to compensate for the traction."
2287,45,10,7.2,2024-05-07,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 3 SE is a clunky shoe with poor traction performance. The cushioning feels good, and the shoe is extra supportive, though."
2288,45,1,6.8,2024-05-03,expert_overall,"I'm not the best person to judge these shoes. The Jordan Zion 3 SE does not line up with my foot shape. The lockdown is impressive, but the fit hurts."

2292,45,7,7.0,2024-05-03,traction,"The traction pattern is the same as the standard Zion 3. The performance works on clean courts, but dirty floors cause problematic sliding."
2293,45,6,7.0,2024-05-03,traction,The traction performance is not great. It only plays well on clean courts.
2294,45,10,5.0,2024-05-07,traction,The traction performance was terrible for me. I slid like crazy in this pair.
2295,45,1,7.0,2024-05-03,traction,The traction is tackier than the standard version but quickly picks up dust.
2296,45,7,9.0,2024-05-03,cushion,"The drop-in midsole is soft underfoot, and it offers decent impact protection. The full-length Zoom is a major improvement."
2297,45,6,8.0,2024-05-03,cushion,The full-length drop-in midsole features full-length Zoom. The cushioning is comfortable and somewhat low to the ground. There's also lots of impact protection.
2298,45,10,9.0,2024-05-07,cushion,The full-length Zoom makes the cushioning my favourite feature. I felt extremely bouncy and well-protected in terms of impact protection.
2299,45,1,7.0,2024-05-03,cushion,The updated drop-in midsole offers more shock absorption while sacrificing bounciness.
2300,45,7,9.0,2024-05-03,materials,The materials are an upgrade on the SE version. I like the nubuck and the other raw materials over the mesh used on the standard version.
2301,45,6,8.0,2024-05-03,materials,The materials feel more premium on the SE version. It gets the job done performance-wise.
2302,45,10,7.0,2024-05-07,materials,"I dislike the nubuck material. I prefer the comfort of the regular version. The upper is supportive, though."
2303,45,1,8.0,2024-05-03,materials,"The uppers are mainly synthetic leather, which is an upgrade. The Formula 23 midsole doesn't hold onto heat, which is nice."
2304,45,7,9.0,2024-05-03,support,The heel counter contains your foot in the back of the shoe well. There's lots of lateral support and containment with the side walls and the midfoot strap.
2305,45,6,8.0,2024-05-03,support,"I like the heel counter and Achilles pillows. My foot felt contained during side-to-side movements, too. The strap also helps contain your midfoot."
2306,45,10,9.0,2024-05-07,support,"The torsional support is solid, and the strap provides extra lockdown."
2307,45,1,6.0,2024-05-03,support,"I'm a fan of the dorsal retention strap. The strap and heel counter combine to keep your heel locked in. The fit negates a lot of the support benefits, though."
2308,45,7,6.5,2024-05-03,fit,The fit feels the same as the standard Zion 3. I had some extra length in the forefoot area. The narrow width bothers me.
2309,45,6,8.0,2024-05-03,fit,"The fit feels narrow, and the forefoot is snug. Just be careful if you have wide feet."
2310,45,10,6.0,2024-05-07,fit,"The fit is extremely snug. The nubuck material squeezed my pinky toe, and it felt uncomfortable."
2311,45,1,6.0,2024-05-03,fit,The fit is incredibly narrow. The shape of the shoe continues to cause problems for wider feet.
2312,45,10,50.0,2024-05-07,outdoor,The rubber compound is hard enough for outdoor use.
2313,45,1,0.0,2024-05-03,outdoor,I would not recommend using this shoe outdoors because the rubber depth is too shallow.
2314,45,6,3,2024-05-03,width,The shoe is narrow.

2317,45,6,2,2024-05-03,size,Go true to size if you have narrow or medium feet. Go up half a size if you have wide feet.
2318,45,10,2,2024-05-07,size,I went up half a size.
2319,45,1,2,2024-05-03,size,Narrow feet can go true to size. Medium feet can go up half a size for a performance fit or up a full size for a roomier fit.
2320,46,1,9.0,2024-05-13,expert_overall,The New Balance Kawhi 4 sacrifices some ground feel for improved cushioning and nimbleness. I felt confident throughout all movements.

2326,46,8,8.2,2024-07-15,expert_overall,"I love the traction and cushioning setup in the New Balance Kawhi 4. The comfort is impressive. I'm not a fan of the shoe's fit, though."
2327,46,7,7.6,2025-03-20,expert_overall,"The standout features of the Kawhi 4 are the traction on clean floors and the support. I also like the fit after a break-in period, but I think the price is too high."
2328,46,67,9.8,2024-12-16,user_overall,Have a lil heel slip only in right foot (normal for me ) but when I wear thicker socks it’s fine they do run a little long but not to bad. Really don’t have to think about these to much when playing and that’s a good thing

2331,46,1,10.0,2024-05-13,traction,"The traction does best when moving front to back. Dust can slightly hinder some side-to-side grip, but it's not a real issue. I love the versatility of the traction."
2332,46,10,9.0,2024-05-13,traction,The traction is impressive. It performs extremely well. The traction moves well with my foot movements.
2333,46,3,10.0,2024-06-30,traction,The traction is a banger. It's elite. I never had a moment where I slipped.
2334,46,5,8.0,2024-05-13,traction,The traction performance is solid on all courts. The grip is consistent. There's no sliding or slipping.
2335,46,6,9.0,2024-05-13,traction,The traction feels outstanding on clean courts and holds up decently on dustier courts.
2336,46,104,9.0,2024-05-19,traction,The traction is sticky and tacky. The performance feels really good. It also handles dust well.
2337,46,8,9.0,2024-07-15,traction,The traction performance is flat-out good. I was able to play with consistent traction on dusty courts as well. I was impressed.
2338,46,7,7.5,2025-03-20,traction,"Linear and lateral movements felt good on clean courts, but the forefoot collects plenty of dust. It causes slight slippage."
2339,46,1,8.5,2024-05-13,cushion,"The FuelCell is more plush and it feels lighter. Combined with the shank, it provides solid bounciness."
2340,46,10,9.0,2024-05-13,cushion,"The dual-density FuelCell midsole is soft, plush, and comfortable. It's one of my favourite features."
2341,46,3,10.0,2024-06-30,cushion,The cushioning feels delicious. The foam absorbs impact well. The setup is one of the best on the market.
2342,46,5,9.0,2024-05-13,cushion,"The cushioning is my favourite feature. You can feel the FuelCell immediately. It's bouncy and reactive, but you do lose some court feel."
2343,46,6,9.0,2024-05-13,cushion,The dual-density FuelCell setup is extremely comfortable. It feels plush and slightly bouncy.
2344,46,104,9.0,2024-05-19,cushion,"The FuelCell feels softer and bouncier than the previous Kawhi model shoes. There's a springy propulsion feeling throughout the forefoot, too. However, the court feel is average."
2345,46,8,9.0,2024-07-15,cushion,I was impressed with the cushioning too. The forefoot feels great. It's soft and balanced.
2346,46,7,7.0,2025-03-20,cushion,The carrier foam is firm but the FuelCell feels bouncy after a break-in period.
2347,46,1,9.0,2024-05-13,materials,"The materials feel like a bear hug around your foot. It feels plush, padded, and comfortable. Breathability can be better."

2349,46,3,8.0,2024-06-30,materials,The materials are lightweight and breathable.
2350,46,5,9.0,2024-05-13,materials,The engineered mesh conforms to your foot nicely. It exceeded my expectations.
2351,46,6,8.0,2024-05-13,materials,The upper is all engineered mesh. It doesn't feel premium but it gets the job done.

2353,46,8,8.0,2024-07-15,materials,"The materials aren't the most durable, but do feel comfortable."
2354,46,7,6.5,2025-03-20,materials,"The material setup is cheap. It's nothing special but it gets the job done. However, I wish the shoe was more breathable."
2355,46,1,9.5,2024-05-13,support,The lockdown is impressive once you break the shoe in. I love the containment from the upper as well.
2356,46,10,8.0,2024-05-13,support,I had zero issues with the support and lockdown.
2357,46,3,7.0,2024-06-30,support,Lateral containment isn't the best. The toe box folded toward the middle. This issue might be my flat feet.
2358,46,5,8.0,2024-05-13,support,The heel cup is A1. The shank plate is stable but the midfoot feels a bit stiff.
2359,46,6,8.0,2024-05-13,support,"I had minimal heel slippage, but the rest of the support features feel good. I never had any instances of lateral instability."
2360,46,104,8.0,2024-05-19,support,I didn't experience any lateral containment issues. It took some extra work with my lacing to get good heel lockdown.
2361,46,8,8.0,2024-07-15,support,I had no issues with the support. The base is stable and I like the heel counter.
2362,46,7,9.0,2025-03-20,support,"This shoe is very supportive. The heel counter is rigid, and I feel contained. I also enjoy the torsional rigidity and gusseted tongue."
2363,46,1,8.0,2024-05-13,fit,The fit feels generous.
2364,46,10,8.0,2024-05-13,fit,"I had some extra length and space above my toes, but I like the fit with thicker socks on."
2365,46,3,8.0,2024-06-30,fit,The fit feels snug and there's no discomfort.
2366,46,5,8.0,2024-05-13,fit,The fit is a bit roomy width-wise.
2367,46,6,8.0,2024-05-13,fit,I felt good with the fit of the shoe.
2368,46,104,8.0,2024-05-19,fit,"The fit is slightly long. I didn't have any serious issues with fit, but I wish there were an extra eyelet."
2369,46,8,7.0,2024-07-15,fit,The fit is the worst category for me. It feels spacious without being too big. The shoe fits weirdly and needs a break-in period to feel better.
2370,46,7,8.0,2025-03-20,fit,"The length is good to go, and the toe box is tapered. It's a comfortable-fitting shoe."
2371,46,1,50.0,2024-05-13,outdoor,"The tread is too thin for outdoor use, but the rubber is tough. Sliding can be a real issue."
2372,46,10,0.0,2024-05-13,outdoor,The grooves are deep but the rubber is too soft for outdoor use.
2373,46,3,50.0,2024-06-30,outdoor,I can't be sure about outdoor durability.
2374,46,5,0.0,2024-05-13,outdoor,I would not take this pair outside.
2375,46,8,0.0,2024-07-15,outdoor,The grooves are too malleable for outdoors.
2376,46,7,0.0,2025-03-20,outdoor,I don't think I would bring this pair outdoors. The rubber compound is too soft.
2377,46,10,3,2024-05-13,width,The width is normal.
2378,46,3,3,2024-06-30,width,The width feels average.
2379,46,5,4,2024-05-13,width,The shoe is slightly wide. People with narrow feet might be able to go down half a size.
2380,46,6,3,2024-05-13,width,My feet are slightly wide and I had no issues with the width.
2381,46,7,2,2025-03-20,width,The shoe is narrow. Go up half a size if you have a wide foot.
2382,46,10,3,2024-05-13,size,I went up half a size. Go true to size for a more snug fit.
2383,46,3,4,2024-06-30,size,I went down half a size.
2384,46,5,3,2024-05-13,size,I recommend trying these on in-store. I went true to size.

2388,47,5,8.6,2024-05-19,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 17 is a lighter, faster version of the KD 16. I like the tweaks Nike made on this model, and the traction is my favourite feature."
2389,47,33,8.4,2024-05-13,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 17s are moderate bad boys. It's a good shoe, but the performance is similar to last year's model. I enjoy the traction the most."
2390,47,3,8.2,2024-06-02,expert_overall,"I'm enjoying my time in the Nike KD 17. Materials, traction, and cushioning are the standout features. However, heel slippage is a concern."
2391,47,8,8.2,2024-07-15,expert_overall,The Nike KD 17 is a solid performer because of the impressive traction and stable cushioning. I also like the lightweight materials. The lockdown is the only minor gripe I have.
2392,47,1,8.0,2024-05-26,expert_overall,The Nike KD 17 is my favourite KD model since the 14. It's flexible and has impressive traction performance. My only complaints are the short shank and the long fit.
2393,47,6,8.0,2024-06-09,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 17 is a solid shoe overall, but I experienced issues with the flimsy upper. The traction and cushioning are comfortable though."
2394,47,20,8.0,2024-12-21,expert_overall,The Nike KD 17 is a solid performer. This pair feels better than the previous model for sure. I like the cushioning and stability.
2395,47,10,7.8,2024-06-04,expert_overall,"I enjoyed the Nike KD 17. It's comfortable, but I don't feel quick playing in the shoe. The traction feels good, but the responsiveness and support are lacking."
2396,47,7,7.7,2024-06-18,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 17 is a letdown for me. The cushioning and materials are both downgraded compared to last year. On the bright side, the traction is impressive."
2397,47,107,7.4,2025-03-21,user_overall,"The traction is great but the cushion is kinda bad, the air strobel in the rearfoot is good, but the shank plate is top-loaded so it prevent me from feeling the air zoom unit. the shoes is low to the ground plus the stiff shank so i don’t recommend this for big player and player with forefoot pain. This shoes have a big issue with lateral containment, the tongue is hard and there is no lockdown. The materials is ok. Support is kind mid. It is roomy at the toe box so down 0,5 size. Ok for outdoor"

2402,47,5,10.0,2024-05-19,traction,"This is one of the best translucent outsoles I played in. You won't have any issues, and the traction is my favourite part of the sneaker."
2403,47,33,9.0,2024-05-13,traction,The multidirectional pattern plays well indoors no matter how dirty the floor.
2404,47,3,8.5,2024-06-02,traction,The traction is impressive. Dust pickup is manageable. It's 8.5 on clean courts and 8 on dusty courts.
2405,47,8,9.0,2024-07-15,traction,"My favourite feature of the shoe is the traction. The grooves are thicker and firmer, and the shoe grips the floor well."
2406,47,1,8.0,2024-05-26,traction,"The traction performs very well on hardwood, and the grip is consistent. This shoe has some of the better grip on a Nike shoe."
2407,47,6,9.0,2024-06-09,traction,"The traction performs very well. You'll have no issues playing on clean courts, and I didn't experience problems with dusty courts either."
2408,47,20,8.0,2024-12-21,traction,The traction bites excellent on clean courts but I slipped on dustier courts.
2409,47,10,9.0,2024-06-04,traction,"The traction performance is phenomenal. You stop on a dime, and there's no break-in time. Make sure to wipe when playing on dusty courts."
2410,47,7,9.0,2024-06-18,traction,"The outsole picks up tons of dust, but the performance is incredibly reliable if you wipe it. I had no issues with the traction."
2411,47,5,9.0,2024-05-19,cushion,"The setup is the same as the KD 16, but it feels lower to the ground, which I prefer. It's a more well-balanced feeling cushion."
2412,47,33,9.0,2024-05-13,cushion,"The foam is soft, while the combination of Air Strobel under the heel and Zoom under the forefoot feels protective."
2413,47,3,9.0,2024-06-02,cushion,The cushioning feels smooth. The performance stays the same. It's responsive and comfortable.
2414,47,8,8.0,2024-07-15,cushion,"The cushioning feels similar to the KD 16. It feels responsive, comfortable, and low to the ground. There isn't much bounce, though."
2415,47,1,8.0,2024-05-26,cushion,"The forefoot shank Strobel board is a welcome addition. I wish it went further into the midfoot, though. It works well with the forefoot Zoom Air unit and the rearfoot Air Strobel."
2416,47,6,9.0,2024-06-09,cushion,"The cushioning feels smooth and comfortable. There's a bit of bounciness in the forefoot area, too."
2417,47,20,9.0,2024-12-21,cushion,The setup works well. I love the impact protection. I felt covered during all high-intensity movements.
2418,47,10,8.0,2024-06-04,cushion,"The cushioning is soft and comfortable. Impact protection is amazing, but it feels somewhat mushy."
2419,47,7,7.5,2024-06-18,cushion,"The cushioning is a bigger letdown than last year. The foam feels firm, and the shank plate prevents you from feeling the forefoot Zoom."
2420,47,5,8.0,2024-05-19,materials,The mesh material feels standard. It's not the best but it's proven.
2421,47,33,8.0,2024-05-13,materials,The mesh feels basic. It's nothing fancy or special. The materials seem durable enough.
2422,47,3,8.0,2024-06-02,materials,The materials are softer and more comfortable. Breathability is excellent.
2423,47,8,9.0,2024-07-15,materials,Materials are a positive for me. The upper is lightweight and feels versatile. I felt comfortable and the shoe felt soft.
2424,47,1,8.0,2024-05-26,materials,"I'm a fan of the tongue and the design. It's padded and comfortable. The shoe won't hold onto heat, but it will hold onto some moisture."
2425,47,6,8.0,2024-06-09,materials,The materials feel good on foot and get the job done performance-wise.
2426,47,20,8.0,2024-12-21,materials,The upper is a cheap textile. It's a mesh upper with a plastic overlay. The assembly quality is decent but breathability is non-existent.
2427,47,10,7.0,2024-06-04,materials,"The material quality isn't the best. I don't like how the upper feels for basketball. It's comfortable for casual wear, though."
2428,47,7,7.0,2024-06-18,materials,"The material setup feels cheap. However, it is lightweight and breathable."
2429,47,5,8.0,2024-05-19,support,Lockdown and support feel nice as long as you lace your shoes tightly.
2430,47,33,8.0,2024-05-13,support,"The support is solid. The side panel was better for containment last year, but the performance is still good. I wish you sat inside the midsole, though."
2431,47,3,7.5,2024-06-02,support,The lateral containment can be better. I experienced some heel slippage too.
2432,47,8,7.0,2024-07-15,support,"In my opinion, the lockdown isn't the best. I wanted to feel more lace pressure."
2433,47,1,9.0,2024-05-26,support,Heel slippage gets better once the shoe breaks in. The lace line and lateral containment impressed me.
2434,47,6,6.0,2024-06-09,support,"I had no issues with heel slippage, but I did have problems with my foot sliding on the footbed. I never fell off the footbed, but I was unstable. The upper lacked support, and I rolled my ankle."
2435,47,20,7.0,2024-12-21,support,"I had to redo the laces to maintain lockdown constantly. I had no problems with stability, and I like the torsional plate."
2436,47,10,7.0,2024-06-04,support,The upper is not supportive. Lateral containment was not the best. My forefoot was moving too often. The overall support is adequate.
2437,47,7,9.0,2024-06-18,support,The internal heel counter feels rigid and secure. I felt contained on the footbed as well. I had no issues with the support.
2438,47,5,8.0,2024-05-19,fit,I didn't have any issues with the fit.
2439,47,33,8.0,2024-05-13,fit,The fit feels standard. It's similar to last year.

2441,47,8,8.0,2024-07-15,fit,The fit is long and it has some extra volume in the forefoot. My wide foot felt more free.
2442,47,1,7.0,2024-05-26,fit,"The fit is long, but the width is medium. The length can cause a sizing problem."
2443,47,6,8.0,2024-06-09,fit,The fit seems the same as the previous model. I enjoyed it.
2444,47,20,8.0,2024-12-21,fit,The shoe is easy to put on and has zero break-in time.
2445,47,10,8.0,2024-06-04,fit,"The materials loosen over time, so I wish I got my regular size. My true size would have been better for me."
2446,47,7,6.0,2024-06-18,fit,"The fit feels weird. There's a lot of volume in the forefoot. I didn't feel locked down, it felt sloppy."
2447,47,5,50.0,2024-05-19,outdoor,The durability should be fine if you stay inside.
2448,47,1,0.0,2024-05-26,outdoor,The outsole will wear down outdoors.
2449,47,10,50.0,2024-06-04,outdoor,The rubber seems decent enough for outdoors. It won't be the best though.
2450,47,8,3,2024-07-15,width,The width is more accommodating than previous KD models.
2451,47,1,3,2024-05-26,width,2E feet can go true to size for a performance fit and up half a size for a roomy fit.
2452,47,6,3,2024-06-09,width,"I have slightly wide feet, and I felt good in this shoe."
2453,47,7,4,2024-06-18,width,The midfoot is wide-foot friendly.
2454,47,3,3,2024-06-02,size,Going true to size is the best option.
2455,47,8,3,2024-07-15,size,Go true to size. I wouldn't recommend down half a size unless you have a narrow foot.
2456,47,1,3,2024-05-26,size,Narrow and medium feet can go true to size.
2457,47,6,3,2024-06-09,size,I went true to size.
2458,47,10,3,2024-06-04,size,"I went up half a size, but I wish I had gone true to size."
2459,47,7,3,2024-06-18,size,I went true to size.
2460,48,33,9.0,2024-03-17,expert_overall,"The Adidas Harden Vol 8 is a fantastic performer. I highly recommend this shoe. The traction is tacky, and the cushioning is very comfortable."
2461,48,2,8.8,2024-03-22,expert_overall,"I like what Adidas is doing with the Harden Volume 8. The Jetboost cushioning feels protective and bouncy, and the traction performance is consistent."

2463,48,7,8.7,2024-03-17,expert_overall,"The Adidas Harden Vol 8 is an excellent performer with standout traction on clean courts. I love the Jetboost midsole for cushioning, too."
2464,48,112,8.6,2024-03-17,expert_overall,"The Adidas Harden Vol 8 has great traction and cushioning, but the weight holds back the performance. The shoe is better suited to bigger, more powerful players."
2465,48,10,8.6,2024-03-17,expert_overall,"The Adidas Harden Vol 8 is a fantastic performer. The traction feels quick and responsive, and the cushioning is comfortable. Heat retention and weight are the main drawbacks."
2466,48,3,8.6,2024-03-17,expert_overall,"The Adidas Harden Vol 8 has excellent traction, and the comfort exceeded my expectations. My only concern is the extra space in the toe box for people who prefer a snug fit."

2468,48,1,8.5,2024-03-17,expert_overall,The Adidas Harden Vol 8 has plush cushioning and reliable traction on clean courts. My main gripes are the weight and heat retention. The shoe is best for players looking to create space.
2469,48,5,7.6,2024-03-27,expert_overall,"I enjoyed Volume 7 slightly more than the Adidas Harden Volume 8. The fit bothered me a bit and the cushioning felt firm. The traction performs well, though."
2470,48,79,9.4,2024-11-25,user_overall,Great overall show suitable for any position only flaw is they pick up dust pretty quick and also size down on these
2471,48,113,9.5,2024-05-31,user_overall,Super comfortable and responsive. Just a bit heavy. Perfect for a big man or bigger guards

2475,48,33,10.0,2024-03-17,traction,The traction performance feels great. The 8 feels tackier than the 7 indoors.
2476,48,2,9.0,2024-03-22,traction,"The traction performs incredibly well, and it feels consistent on dust."
2477,48,9,9.0,2024-03-22,traction,The traction performs very well. The bite feels as good as the Harden 7 and performs slightly better on dusty courts.
2478,48,7,8.5,2024-03-17,traction,You will have no issues with lateral cuts and motions on clean courts. I recommend wiping on dusty courts because the outsole picks up dust quickly.
2479,48,112,9.0,2024-03-17,traction,I had no issues with the traction. The performance is dope.
2480,48,10,9.0,2024-03-17,traction,"The traction becomes better after a break-in period. It's close to top-tier, but you must wipe the dust buildup."
2481,48,3,10.0,2024-03-17,traction,Traction is one of the best features. You can't go wrong here. The performance is top-tier indoors.
2482,48,6,9.0,2024-03-22,traction,The traction performance is great. You'll have no issues stopping on a dime on clean courts. Make sure to wipe off the dust to avoid minor sliding.
2483,48,1,8.0,2024-03-17,traction,"The traction is narrow, thin, and shallow. It performs best on clean indoor courts. The outsole picks up dust quickly until the rubber warms up."
2484,48,5,8.0,2024-03-27,traction,"The outsole uses a proven design, and it feels good."
2485,48,33,9.0,2024-03-17,cushion,The cushioning feels phenomenal after a short break-in period. It's a lot of bang for your buck.
2486,48,2,10.0,2024-03-22,cushion,The full-length Jetboost is a big step in the right direction. There's added impact protection with some bounciness.
2487,48,9,10.0,2024-03-22,cushion,"The Jetboost feels comfortable, and I enjoy Boost in general. It feels low to the ground with added impact protection."
2488,48,7,9.0,2024-03-17,cushion,"There's a ton of impact protection, especially at the back of the shoe. The Jetboost feels plush and comfortable. I love what Adidas is doing with Jetboost."
2489,48,112,9.0,2024-03-17,cushion,"The cushioning feels great, especially towards the back of the shoe."
2490,48,10,10.0,2024-03-17,cushion,The full-length Jetboost does everything very well. It's one of my favourite setups. I like it slightly better than the Volume 7. The step-in comfort and responsiveness feel amazing.
2491,48,3,9.0,2024-03-17,cushion,The Jetboost feels bouncy with a smooth transition. The impact protection is solid too.
2492,48,6,9.0,2024-03-22,cushion,"The Jetboost perfectly blends impact protection, responsiveness, and court feel."
2493,48,1,9.0,2024-03-17,cushion,"Adidas' Jetboost provides launch, comfort, and impact protection. It does everything well except for heat regulation. The foam gets warm."
2494,48,5,8.0,2024-03-27,cushion,The Jetboost feels firm before you break the cushioning in.
2495,48,33,8.0,2024-03-17,materials,The materials are interesting. It feels comfortable.
2496,48,2,8.0,2024-03-22,materials,The upper materials feel softer than the Volume 7. I didn't experience any discomfort in this shoe.
2497,48,9,8.0,2024-03-22,materials,"The upper is a mix of synthetic and textile materials. I love the look. The weight improves slightly, but the breathability is still not there."
2498,48,7,8.0,2024-03-17,materials,"The upper is thin and breathable. The mesh is comfortable on your feet, too."
2499,48,112,8.0,2024-03-17,materials,"The shoe is heavy. I would've liked more padding around the heel collar. I like the materials, but it's also a hot sneaker."
2500,48,10,7.0,2024-03-17,materials,"The upper materials are my least favourite part of the shoe. It feels soft, but the toe box has excess material I didn't enjoy."
2501,48,3,8.0,2024-03-17,materials,"The materials feel cheap and almost flimsy, but it doesn't affect performance. I had no discomfort."
2502,48,6,8.0,2024-03-22,materials,"The quality could be better, but the materials get the job done performance-wise."
2503,48,1,8.0,2024-03-17,materials,The materials are thin and forgiving but also stout. The foam on the sides of the shoe is soft. The main downside is the shoe holds onto heat.
2504,48,5,7.0,2024-03-27,materials,The textile upper is not bad performance-wise.
2505,48,33,9.0,2024-03-17,support,"The EVA sidewall offers tons of support, especially laterally. The wide base is stable, and the heel counter is massive."
2506,48,2,9.0,2024-03-22,support,The side panels provide extra lateral stability. The heel is also stable and secure.
2507,48,9,9.0,2024-03-22,support,The torsional support is solid. I prefer shoes with less forefoot flex. I feel safe and secure in the Harden Volume 8.
2508,48,7,9.0,2024-03-17,support,There's no shortage of support features on the Harden Vol. 8. The heel and lateral containment are impressive.
2509,48,112,9.0,2024-03-17,support,"I had no issues with lockdown. The support feels great, too."
2510,48,10,9.0,2024-03-17,support,"You'll be covered for support and lockdown, especially for lateral containment."
2511,48,3,8.0,2024-03-17,support,"I had a small issue with torsional support and stability, but it didn't bother me. The support is a solid package overall."
2512,48,6,9.0,2024-03-22,support,"I had zero heel slippage in the shoe. Lateral containment is excellent, too."
2513,48,1,9.0,2024-03-17,support,"The double heel counter is outstanding, and the containment is excellent."
2514,48,5,8.0,2024-03-27,support,"If you get the correct size, you won't have any issues with support and lockdown."
2515,48,33,9.0,2024-03-17,fit,The shoe fits identically to the Harden Vol 7. I had no issues with lace pressure or lockdown.
2516,48,2,8.0,2024-03-22,fit,I appreciate how easy the shoe is to put on.
2517,48,9,8.0,2024-03-22,fit,I like the consistency of the fit within the Harden line. It feels slightly snug.
2518,48,7,9.0,2024-03-17,fit,There's no extra room or volume in this shoe. I enjoy the sock-like fit. It feels close to being 1-to-1.
2519,48,112,8.0,2024-03-17,fit,"The shoe fits large, but it didn't affect performance too much."
2520,48,10,8.0,2024-03-17,fit,"The shoe fits me well, but there is a bit of extra length."
2521,48,3,8.0,2024-03-17,fit,"The shoe is easy to put on, but there's some dead space in the toe box. It didn't affect me performance-wise."
2522,48,6,8.0,2024-03-22,fit,I felt perfectly fine in terms of fit. It feels snug and locked in.
2523,48,1,8.5,2024-03-17,fit,"I didn't have an issue getting the shoe on my foot, and it felt secure and locked in when it was on."
2524,48,5,7.0,2024-03-27,fit,"The shoe is slightly spacious for me, especially length-wise."
2525,48,7,0.0,2024-03-17,outdoor,I wouldn't take these shoes outdoors.
2526,48,112,0.0,2024-03-17,outdoor,I don't recommend this shoe for outdoors.
2527,48,10,50.0,2024-03-17,outdoor,"The rubber feels durable, but be careful outdoors."
2528,48,6,0.0,2024-03-22,outdoor,I wouldn't use this shoe outdoors.
2529,48,1,0.0,2024-03-17,outdoor,The outsole pattern is too thin for outdoor use.
2530,48,5,0.0,2024-03-27,outdoor,I recommend staying inside.
2531,48,7,2,2024-03-17,width,I recommend trying the shoe in-store or going up half a size if you have wide feet.
2532,48,10,3,2024-03-17,width,People with wide feet can try going up half a size.
2533,48,3,3,2024-03-17,width,The width feels normal.
2534,48,6,3,2024-03-22,width,My slightly wide foot had no issues.
2535,48,1,2,2024-03-17,width,The fit tapers towards the forefoot. People with 2E and above feet can go true to size.
2536,48,2,4,2024-03-22,size,I recommend going half a size down.
2537,48,9,3,2024-03-22,size,Go true to size to your Adidas size.
2538,48,7,3,2024-03-17,size,I went with my standard size 10.5 with no issues.
2539,48,112,4,2024-03-17,size,I went half a size down. I probably could've gone a full size down.
2540,48,10,2,2024-03-17,size,I went up half a size.
2541,48,3,3,2024-03-17,size,I went true to size.
2542,48,6,3,2024-03-22,size,I went true to size.
2543,48,1,4,2024-03-17,size,Narrow and medium feet can go down half a size.
2544,48,5,4,2024-03-27,size,I suggest trying the shoe on. The fit is half a size big for me.
2545,49,3,8.8,2024-05-01,expert_overall,"I love how durable the Jordan Tatum 2 feels. The revamped construction is comfortable and supportive, while the traction and cushioning are average."
2546,49,10,8.0,2024-03-17,expert_overall,"The Jordan Tatum 2 is light and responsive, but the performance on dust is not good. You have to keep the outsole dust-free at all costs."
2547,49,112,7.8,2024-03-17,expert_overall,The Jordan Tatum 2 is an upgrade on the Tatum 1. I like the Air Strobel cushioning; the support and lockdown were also solid. I don't like the materials and the traction is not top-tier.
2548,49,7,7.6,2024-05-26,expert_overall,"The Jordan Tatum 2 is a letdown because of the required break-in time. The shoe is supportive, but the traction and cushioning are inconsistent."
2549,49,20,7.6,2024-06-14,expert_overall,"The safety and support of the Jordan Tatum 2 is improved, but the traction and cushioning take a step back."
2550,49,1,7.5,2024-03-17,expert_overall,"The Jordan Tatum 2 feels dull. Lateral stability and ground feel are the pros, but the traction attracts a lot of dust and the cushioning feels dead."
2551,49,5,7.4,2024-03-17,expert_overall,"The Jordan Tatum 2 is an upgrade from the 1, but there's plenty of room for improvement. The cushioning is light and the fit and support are decent."
2552,49,6,7.4,2024-03-17,expert_overall,"I can't recommend the Jordan Tatum 2, mainly because of the poor traction. The cushioning is well-balanced, but the materials are low-quality."
2553,49,104,7.4,2024-05-03,expert_overall,I did not enjoy my time playing in the Jordan Tatum 2. The side panels ruin the shoe for me. There isn't enough flexibility built in.
2554,49,117,6.5,2025-03-19,user_overall,"Overall not the best shoe, if you are a fan of tatum i would use these if you are a casual player. I wouldn’t seriously wear these in an actual game as I didn’t have much confidence in them to keep me secure with the heel slippage and the sides of my feet hurt immensely from the design. I’ve never worn such uncomfortable shoes before but I would recommend them for outdoor play as the cushion was pretty good."
2555,49,118,6.6,2024-03-24,user_overall,Blud really can’t make a good pair of shoes. Even worse than the Tatum ones.

2558,49,3,8.0,2024-05-01,traction,"The traction is average. It's nothing special, but there is enough grip for my liking."
2559,49,10,7.0,2024-03-17,traction,"For the first few days, the traction performance was not good. Performance on clean courts improves over time, but dust poses an issue."
2560,49,112,7.0,2024-03-17,traction,"The outsole picked up a lot of dust. It's not top-tier, but it's not bad."
2561,49,7,7.5,2024-05-26,traction,"You'll be good to go on clean courts, but the shoe picks up lots of dust on dirtier courts."
2562,49,20,8.0,2024-06-14,traction,I doubted the traction at first. The grip feels solid on clean hardwood.
2563,49,1,6.0,2024-03-17,traction,"There's a lot of ground contact for the traction, but the outsole picks up and holds on to dust faster than any other shoe. I enjoy the profile if you can keep the dust off."
2564,49,5,7.0,2024-03-17,traction,The traction is nothing mind-blowing. It's solid if you make sure to wipe the dust off often.
2565,49,6,6.0,2024-03-17,traction,"You won't have issues on clean courts, but the traction performance on any other surface is not good. The outsole is a dust magnet."
2566,49,104,7.0,2024-05-03,traction,The outsole picks up tons of dust but performs better after a few days. The performance is lacklustre.
2567,49,3,8.0,2024-05-01,cushion,"The cushioning feels average. It's not very responsive, but the full-length Air Strobel does provide some feedback."
2568,49,10,8.0,2024-03-17,cushion,The cushioning feels pretty comfortable. I like the full-length Air Strobel.
2569,49,112,8.0,2024-03-17,cushion,The cushioning is my favourite part of the shoe. It's a comfortable ride.
2570,49,7,7.0,2024-05-26,cushion,"The Phylon foam feels like a cinderblock. It takes a long time to break in. The Air Strobel in the forefoot feels comfortable, though."
2571,49,20,8.0,2024-06-14,cushion,"The midsole feels stiff out of the box. The foam bottoms out fairly quickly, so impact protection can be better. The court feel is great, though."
2572,49,1,7.0,2024-03-17,cushion,The full-length Air Strobel lays on top of EVA foam. The low stack caters more toward shock absorption than bounciness. It feels deadened.
2573,49,5,8.0,2024-03-17,cushion,The Air Strobel unit feels nice for impact protection. The setup is well-balanced and light.
2574,49,6,8.0,2024-03-17,cushion,The Air Strobel is comfortable. It provides a good balance between responsiveness and impact protection.
2575,49,104,7.0,2024-05-03,cushion,"The cushioning is low to the ground with tons of court feel. The impact protection is decent, but the shoe is stiff."
2576,49,3,9.0,2024-05-01,materials,"The materials are not premium, but the way the shoe is constructed is incredibly comfortable. The shoe's build caters to what I like in a shoe."
2577,49,10,8.0,2024-03-17,materials,"I like the use of materials. It's supportive and sturdy. The shoe is incredibly light, too."
2578,49,112,7.0,2024-03-17,materials,"The padding feels comfortable. The upper is decent quality, but it causes the shoe to run hot."
2579,49,7,8.0,2024-05-26,materials,"The materials are lightweight and breathable. The upper conforms to your foot nicely, too."
2580,49,20,7.0,2024-06-14,materials,The materials feel stiff out of the box. Breathability is also poor in most areas of the upper. The assembly quality leaves much to be desired.
2581,49,1,8.0,2024-03-17,materials,The upper is well-backed containment-wise and it feels durable. The materials heat up a lot.
2582,49,5,6.0,2024-03-17,materials,"The materials are not as functional as I would like. The upper is less flexible and comfortable. The durability is better, though."
2583,49,6,7.0,2024-03-17,materials,"The mesh feels low-quality, but it does the job performance-wise."
2584,49,104,8.0,2024-05-03,materials,"The materials are flexible and comfortable, but I don't like the side pods. The construction restricts some of my movements."
2585,49,3,9.0,2024-05-01,support,Both the lateral and medial sides are more supportive this year.
2586,49,10,9.0,2024-03-17,support,The support and lockdown are significantly improved compared to last year. The materials and overlays are also supportive.
2587,49,112,9.0,2024-03-17,support,Support and lockdown were great.
2588,49,7,8.5,2024-05-26,support,The lateral containment is impressive because of the added rubber on the sidewalls. The torsional support is better too.
2589,49,20,8.0,2024-06-14,support,My concerns with the Tatum 1 are resolved on the Tatum 2. I felt more stable and secure. Forefoot lockdown feels better as well. My only concern is the heel counter.
2590,49,1,8.5,2024-03-17,support,The lateral containment is outstanding. The medial support can potentially be an issue for wider feet.
2591,49,5,8.0,2024-03-17,support,"The upper provides extra lateral support. I felt locked down, too."
2592,49,6,8.0,2024-03-17,support,I had no issues with the support. My foot felt secure on the footbed and during lateral movements.
2593,49,104,8.0,2024-05-03,support,Containment around the midfoot feels secure.
2594,49,3,10.0,2024-05-01,fit,The shoe's snug fit feels perfect. I didn't experience pinching or discomfort.
2595,49,10,8.0,2024-03-17,fit,"The shoe fits me extremely well. Beware if you have a wide foot, though."
2596,49,112,8.0,2024-03-17,fit,I had no issues with heel slippage.
2597,49,7,7.0,2024-05-26,fit,"The shoe is form-fitting. I enjoyed it, but the rubber pods on the sides are bothersome."
2598,49,20,7.0,2024-06-14,fit,The shoe fits decently after an initial break-in period.
2599,49,1,8.0,2024-03-17,fit,The midfoot is thin. The upper will squish feet with more volume. The fit will be better for people with low-volume feet; it'll be more comfortable.
2600,49,5,8.0,2024-03-17,fit,I didn't have any issues with the fit.
2601,49,6,8.0,2024-03-17,fit,"I experienced some pinching and pressure on the medial side, but it broke in eventually. Everywhere else, the fit feels good."
2602,49,104,7.0,2024-05-03,fit,The fit is slightly long and narrow. The stiff construction prevented me from finding a comfortable fit.
2603,49,3,50.0,2024-05-01,outdoor,The outsole is more durable than the previous version.
2604,49,10,50.0,2024-03-17,outdoor,The rubber is decent enough for outdoors.
2605,49,7,0.0,2024-05-26,outdoor,I wouldn't use this pair outdoors.
2606,49,1,0.0,2024-03-17,outdoor,"The outsole performs better outdoors, but the durability is not up to par."
2607,49,1,2,2024-03-17,width,The width is slightly narrow. Go up at least half a size if you have a 2E foot.
2608,49,6,1,2024-03-17,width,The width feels narrow.
2609,49,10,2,2024-03-17,size,I went up half a size.
2610,49,7,3,2024-05-26,size,I went with my standard size.
2611,49,20,3,2024-06-14,size,The shoes run perfectly true to size.
2612,49,1,3,2024-03-17,size,Narrow and medium feet can go true to size.
2613,49,5,3,2024-03-17,size,These shoes run true to size.
2614,49,6,3,2024-03-17,size,The Tatum 2 runs true to size.
2615,50,1,8.7,2024-03-26,expert_overall,The Anta KAI 1 feels incredibly low to the ground. The traction and cushioning also allow players to get creative with their movements.
2616,50,10,8.6,2024-04-05,expert_overall,The Anta KAI 1 has consistent traction and responsive cushioning. I felt fast and quick while playing in this shoe.

2621,50,5,8.2,2024-05-01,expert_overall,"The Anta KAI 1 impressed me performance-wise. I like the materials and construction, but the cushioning is my favourite feature."
2622,50,3,8.2,2024-05-19,expert_overall,"I had a fun time playing in the Anta KAI 1. It's a solid performer, but it isn't an elite shoe. The cushioning and traction are the best features."
2623,50,6,8.2,2024-06-09,expert_overall,The Anta KAI 1 is a solid pickup. My only gripe is the break-in time. I enjoyed the cushioning and overall performance after the shoe broke in.
2624,50,20,7.8,2024-11-02,expert_overall,"I don't recommend the Anta KAI 1 for bigs. If you play on clean courts, this shoe is more suitable for guards and wings."
2625,50,121,9.2,2024-05-07,user_overall,"I love these shoes. Absolutely no negative aspects except maybe the weight. I am a point guard and I can only recommend this shoe. The lockdown is fantastic. You don't slip a bit in these shoes and you can react very quickly. Ive only played indoors and the traction was great, even on dusty courts. If you can get these for a decent price, do not hesitate to pick these up if youre interested in a great guard shoe. I got the Anta Kai 1 Playoffs White."
2626,50,122,9.0,2024-04-17,user_overall,"Cushion feels softer the longer you play, traction is very consistent even in dusty court"

2631,50,10,8.0,2024-04-05,traction,"The traction performs very well after an initial break-in period. It's solid, but not top-tier."
2632,50,9,10.0,2024-05-01,traction,"The traction pattern is unusual. The tread is not aggressive, but it still performs very well. I was pleasantly surprised by how little dust the shoe picked up."
2633,50,2,8.0,2024-03-17,traction,The KAI 1 traction is flat but performs decently well.

2798,52,10,8.0,2024-03-17,support,"The torsional support seems decent. Support and lockdown feel decent, but the lateral containment in the forefoot can be better with some additional reinforcement."
2799,52,1,7.0,2023-12-28,support,The containment is better for smaller players than for larger players.
2800,52,20,7.0,2024-04-14,support,"The shoe lacks lateral containment when the materials warm up. The lockdown is decent with the laces, but I had issues with heel lockdown."
2801,52,2,8.0,2024-03-09,support,The lateral support feels good but not great.
2802,52,7,9.0,2024-02-27,fit,"I had some issues with the fit. The length is too short. Once I found the right fit, I enjoyed how snug they felt."
2803,52,33,8.0,2024-02-18,fit,"The fit is 1-to-1. It's snug and slightly pointy. I love it, but I can see it causing others trouble."

2805,52,5,8.0,2024-03-09,fit,"I enjoy the fit, but it is snug, tight, and compact."
2806,52,6,8.0,2024-03-09,fit,The forefoot felt tight at the beginning but became better with play. I enjoyed the fit.
2807,52,3,8.0,2024-03-09,fit,"My toes hit the upper when I performed a step back. It was slightly uncomfortable. The fit feels snug, but it won't be an issue for most."
2808,52,10,7.0,2024-03-17,fit,The fit feels short and narrow because of the extra padding in the shoe.
2809,52,1,8.0,2023-12-28,fit,The fit is a little wide in the midfoot and slightly short length-wise.
2810,52,20,7.0,2024-04-14,fit,The fit feels snug because of the extra padding inside.
2811,52,2,8.0,2024-03-09,fit,The shoe hugs my foot well.

2834,53,33,8.2,2024-02-18,expert_overall,"The Under Armour FUTR X Elite is an interesting innovative performer. The cushioning is stable and comfortable, but the fit might divide players."
2835,53,6,8.0,2024-03-09,expert_overall,Pick up the Under Armour FUTR X Elite if you enjoy Flow cushioning and traction. It's excellent on clean courts and has plenty of responsiveness.

2841,53,33,10.0,2024-02-18,traction,The traction performance is fantastic. It's elite.
2842,53,6,9.0,2024-03-09,traction,The Flow performs as expected. It performs insanely well on clean courts. Avoid dusty settings.
2843,53,23,8.0,2024-02-18,traction,The traction is excellent on clean courts but gets slippery on dusty courts.
2844,53,7,9.0,2024-02-24,cushion,"The midsole has a ton of impact protection. It feels softer than the Curry line, too. There's also plenty of court feel in the forefoot."
2845,53,1,9.0,2024-02-18,cushion,"The dual-density Flow foam is bulky with plenty of compression. The midsole feels secure and stable, and the shank feels like a springboard."
2846,53,33,8.0,2024-02-18,cushion,"The Flow foam in this setup feels exaggerated. It promotes stability, and it features plenty of court feel. It's not the most cushioned, though."
2847,53,6,7.0,2024-03-09,cushion,"Flow foam is a firm, responsive setup with a little impact protection."
2848,53,23,7.0,2024-02-18,cushion,The Flow foam is dense and reactive. It offers fluidity and court feel over impact protection.
2849,53,7,9.5,2024-02-24,materials,"The upper is Intelliknit. It's reinforced for extra support, and it feels comfortable. It feels like a sock on my feet."
2850,53,1,8.0,2024-02-18,materials,"I expected the laces to dig into my feet but they didn't. The forefoot area needs breaking in, but the materials are incredibly breathable."
2851,53,33,8.0,2024-02-18,materials,"Under Armour uses its Intelliknit on the upper with an added layer reinforcing it. It feels comfortable around the foot, but the forefoot stretches."
2852,53,6,8.0,2024-03-09,materials,"Under Armour's Intelliknit upper is a fully woven material. It feels great, and they get the job done."
2853,53,23,6.0,2024-02-18,materials,"The Intelliknit fabric is soft, lightweight, and breathable. There's no break-in time and there are no weak points for containment. The loose forefoot weave reduces performance, though."
2854,53,7,9.0,2024-02-24,support,"The heel counter is adequate, and the lateral guardrail keeps you contained on the footbed."
2855,53,1,8.0,2024-02-18,support,"The shoe's base feels stable. These are some of the better shoes for forgiveness underfoot. I appreciate the stiff heel counter, too."

2857,53,6,8.0,2024-03-09,support,I didn't have any issues with the support. The performance is better than expected.
2858,53,23,8.0,2024-02-18,support,"My main complaint is the wider toe box causing your toes to splay resulting in reduced reaction time. The rest of the shoe is stable and secure, especially the midsole."

2861,53,33,7.0,2024-02-18,fit,"I prefer a tight, snug fit. This forefoot area allows more freedom of movement among the toes because of the stretchy material."
2862,53,6,8.0,2024-03-09,fit,I felt perfectly fine with my regular size.
2863,53,23,6.0,2024-02-18,fit,The textile upper is too forgiving and the forefoot feels too wide.

2867,53,6,3,2024-03-09,size,"The fit is true to size. If you have a narrow foot, you might get away with going down half a size."
2868,54,1,9.0,2024-03-17,expert_overall,The New Balance Fresh Foam BB V2 is one of the most protective shoes for support and impact protection. The Fresh Foam X does a good job of keeping your whole foot comfortable.

2872,54,10,8.2,2024-03-17,expert_overall,"The New Balance Fresh Foam BB V2 has comfortable cushioning. The shoe caters to impact protection. The traction slides a bit during forward movements, which is frustrating."
2873,54,132,9.4,2024-03-22,user_overall,"These are freaking great. Traction is beastly (outdoors) and seems durable enough to hold up. Cushion is the main point of this shoe though, as it is full-length Fresh Foam X and IT IS AWESOME. Even the materials feel super premium New Balance killed it this year with this and the Two Wxy v4. Now if only the Kawhi's would come out :/"
2874,54,133,9.6,2024-04-17,user_overall,"The Fresh Foam suits me very well, I play as a power forward and my knees needed shoes like these. At first the hardness of the materials bothers my fingers a little, but that is normal in all durable textile shoes.

2877,54,1,9.0,2024-03-17,traction,The outsole tread will be a fan favourite if you don't slide and drag your feet. The grip is substantial.
2878,54,104,10.0,2024-04-14,traction,"The traction is one of the best features of the shoe. It stops and grips on all courts, even dusty ones."
2879,54,3,10.0,2024-03-22,traction,"The traction is fantastic. Dust pickup is not an issue, and the outsole is tacky."
2880,54,6,8.0,2024-03-17,traction,"The traction feels good. It's not the best, though. I had no issues on clean courts, but dust caused some sliding."
2881,54,10,8.0,2024-03-17,traction,"The traction feels weird. It feels good right out of the box, but it slides on forward movements. Lateral movements are grippy, though."
2882,54,1,9.0,2024-03-17,cushion,"New Balance uses Fresh Foam X foam with a bottom-loaded shank. The foam is soft and comfortable. In my experience, the foam lasts long, too."
2883,54,104,9.0,2024-04-14,cushion,"The Fresh Foam is plush and you can feel it underfoot. It feels smooth, but the stack height means there's less responsiveness."
2884,54,3,9.0,2024-03-22,cushion,The cushioning is excellent. It feels responsive and slightly bouncy. The fantastic impact protection is a cherry on top. I have a minor gripe with the stack height being high off the ground.
2885,54,6,9.0,2024-03-17,cushion,"The Fresh Foam feels very comfortable, especially for impact protection. The bounce is subtle, too."
2886,54,10,9.0,2024-03-17,cushion,The cushioning setup is comfortable. Impact protection is off the charts. Avoid this shoe if you prefer a low-to-the-ground setup.
2887,54,1,8.0,2024-03-17,materials,"The materials are plush and padded, but not breathable. The shoe will exchange heat fine, but it might retain moisture."
2888,54,104,9.0,2024-04-14,materials,The materials are a huge improvement. The only downside is adjusting the lacing during play because the materials loosen up.
2889,54,3,8.0,2024-03-22,materials,"The breathability is better than expected, and the upper feels comfortable."
2890,54,6,9.0,2024-03-17,materials,There are a few different materials on the shoe. The quality and performance feel very good.
2891,54,10,8.0,2024-03-17,materials,The materials feel old school. The padding is average but cozy. I appreciate the quality.
2892,54,1,10.0,2024-03-17,support,"The heel comfort is incredible right off the bat. This is one of the best shoes for support and stability, mainly because of the fit."

2917,55,86,8.0,2024-02-24,expert_overall,"The Nike G.T. Cut 3 has all the bells and whistles but needs to refine how they work in unison. The traction performs well, and the ZoomX implementation is fresh."
2918,55,1,7.8,2024-01-29,expert_overall,"You need the proper skill set to use the Nike G.T. Cut 3. The shoe plays fast, and the cushioning is bouncy. Torsional support and lateral containment can be an issue."
2919,55,135,9.3,2024-06-25,user_overall,"The only thing negative I have to say about the G.T. Cut 3’s are their durability, I feel like they were made more for pro players who would buy a new pair every game. After only  2 months of wearing this shoe the back tab has already ripped off and many of the sewed parts have ripped or been completely torn off. But the traction on this shoe is one of the best I have tried, the bite is very sharp and it squeaks even if it is covered in dust."
2920,55,76,9.2,2024-04-03,user_overall,"once you break it in its god send. traction is top tier and dust pickup is pretty minimal. cushion is caged zoom x which is amazing, super comfortable and bouncy. impact prot is great. the shoe is super light and the lockdown is pretty good but not amazing. materials are soft and comfy on foot which applies to the fit as well. top tier performer and my fav in the rotation rn"
2921,55,136,8.4,2024-03-04,user_overall,"Pretty good shoe, but there are definitely better options for 200$. Traction is outstanding on clean courts; it picks up a bit of dust but a simple wipe will remove most of it. It feels quick and light, and very comfortable, but if you want a low to the ground and responsive shoe, this is not for you. Materials feel cheap, tho."
2922,55,132,8.6,2024-02-22,user_overall,These are bangers! If the support was better these would be top 3 shoe of the year for sure highly recommend. Just don't take em outside

2929,55,7,8.0,2024-01-29,traction,"You'll be good to go on clean courts, but dust can cause issues. You have to wipe on dirtier courts."

2934,55,1,9.0,2024-01-29,traction,"The initial grip is impressive, but the rubber picks up dust. Make sure to wipe often to maintain performance."

2936,55,3,9.5,2024-01-29,cushion,"The cushioning is one of the bright spots. The ZoomX feels impressive out of the box, but I'm keeping an eye on the longevity. The setup is nearly perfect."
2937,55,33,9.0,2024-04-21,cushion,"There's no Zoom Air, but the ZoomX foam is ridiculously bouncy. I love the way the cushioning feels."
2938,55,2,9.0,2024-01-29,cushion,The full-length ZoomX foam is responsive and low to the ground. You can feel the bounciness under the forefoot.

2944,55,86,8.0,2024-02-24,cushion,"I didn't feel the ZoomX foam much because it's encased in Cushlon. The cushioning is responsive, not bouncy."
2945,55,1,8.0,2024-01-29,cushion,"The midsole is full-length ZoomX foam, which is super bouncy. The shank is small, making the shoe incredibly flexible. There isn't much rigidity, though."

3000,56,3,8.4,2024-01-29,expert_overall,"The Jordan 38 Low doesn't improve enough from the regular 38 to be worth it. The traction and cushioning are solid, but the extra flexibility felt less secure."
3001,56,10,8.2,2024-02-24,expert_overall,"The Jordan 38 Low is a decent performer for a lower price than the mid-cut version. The traction is decent, and the full-length Zoom Strobel is bouncy."

3017,56,3,10.0,2024-01-29,cushion,You can't go wrong with the full-length Zoom Strobel. This is one of my favourite cushioning setups.
3018,56,10,9.0,2024-02-24,cushion,I only feel the full-length Zoom Strobel unit for the bounciness. It lacks some responsiveness.

3053,57,1,7.5,2024-01-29,cushion,I love the shank plate implementation. It works very well in combination with the Bounce foam.
3054,57,3,8.0,2024-01-29,cushion,"The Bounce midsole is lightweight and offers some bounceback. The responsiveness is decent, too."
3055,57,6,7.0,2024-01-29,cushion,"The midsole has some impact protection, but it's better for responsiveness because the forefoot feels thin."
3056,57,1,8.0,2024-01-29,materials,"The synthetic leather creates lots of structure and padding. The breathability is not good, though."
3057,57,3,8.0,2024-01-29,materials,"The synthetic upper feels slightly cheap, but it doesn't affect performance. The breathability is also decent."

3078,58,140,8.9,2024-11-25,user_overall,"The rubber on the tip of the toe box peeled off after 3 weeks of playing but the traction is the best I have ever had. This is a great guard shoe, but not a center shoe, due to the fragility of the materials on the shoes. When i posted up someone they stepped on the shoe and it totally scratched up the nike logo which shouldnt happen. But I am very pleased with this shoe."

3103,58,1,7.0,2024-01-29,materials,"I enjoy the material setup, especially around the lace line. The construction and durability are solid, but the breathability can be better."
3104,58,10,8.0,2024-01-31,support,"The shoe lacks torsional support. Lateral containment and lockdown were not an issue, though."

The only disadvantages are that this shoe is heavy (but I don’t mind it that much ) and it is not that breathable . Also the laces gets untied easily(maybe it’s my fault). Overall this shoe is amazing and I would recommend it for powerful guards and wings .They are really similar to the hardens that I have played in but I might choose the ae over them.Ineedmoretimetryingthem"
3222,61,147,8.8,2024-05-12,user_overall,"Overall the Adidas AE1 is a top performer and I find out performs most shoes that I’ve tried (Harden 7, Ja 1, etc). The durability of the shoe after a playing a few tournaments was excellent, however I did notice some scuffing on the rubber sidewalls of the shoe, You can’t see the scuffs from far but are noticeable when you have the shoe in hand. Traction on them is one of the best I’ve tried, but if you play on dusty courts the space in between the ridges gets really dusty. Overall great shoe."
3223,61,94,8.8,2025-07-17,user_overall,"Traction is pretty grippy and bites well, does pick up a little bit of dust but just wipe and you’ll be fine. Cushion is really nice in the heel and comfy, I wish the forefoot used boost as well but good impact protection, comfy, and bouncy. Materials are soft and supportive and pretty well paded, only downside is that they’re so heavy. It’s a high top so it supportive and the laces lock you in well, never felt unstable. Sometimes it can be a little tricky to get on being a high top,butfitsnice."
3224,61,76,9.0,2024-05-09,user_overall,"traction is top tier and bites very hard (dust doesn’t effect it either). cushion is very comfy but only missed 10 because impact protection could be better but you sacrifice that for court feel. X plate feels similar to gt cut 3 but with more torsion support. tpu side walls are very supportive, amazing, but missed on 10 on materials because there so heavy combined with the amount of rubber on shoe. prolonged play can make your feet feel really hot for lack of ventilation. overall top tier shoe!"
3225,61,148,9.6,2024-10-26,user_overall,"This shoe was beautiful from the day it released. Since I haven’t had really good experiences with adidas since the harden vol 7, i thought the colorways were the only good thing about it. But i was definitely wrong. This shoe from the traction to cushion to the material were amazing. It is also wide-foot friendly and It fits likes a glove so I would say go true to size. One of my favorite players right now and i hope to see more good adidas shoes like this one. One negative really is the laces."

3233,61,2,9.0,2024-02-18,traction,The traction is grippy on clean indoor courts. The only downside is the dust pickup.

3246,61,1,9.0,2023-12-28,cushion,The shoe is bottom-heavy because of the thick Boost and the substantial shanks. The energy return is even between shock absorption and bounciness.

3280,61,9,0.0,2024-03-22,outdoor,The rubber is too soft for outdoor use.

3298,62,3,8.0,2023-12-28,expert_overall,"The Puma Scoot Zeros feel incredibly similar to the MB.02. The performance is decent, but there aren't many differences from the rest of the Puma lineup."

3300,62,1,7.7,2024-02-27,expert_overall,"The Puma Scoot Zero is a nice, crafty shoe. I like the traction performance and how accommodating the fit feels."
3301,62,112,7.4,2024-01-11,expert_overall,I would only recommend the Puma Scoot Zeros to guards. It feels responsive but lacks impact protection.
3302,62,10,7.2,2024-04-21,expert_overall,"I did not like playing in the Puma Scoot Zeros. This shoe is a disappointment. Traction and cushioning are both poor, and the shoe is heavy."
3303,62,149,7.8,2025-01-25,user_overall,This shoe was very bulky and heavy for me especially for guards like me. The cushioning was the only good thing about this shoe. I was slipping no matter how many times I wiped the shoe. The support was decent but the material can be better. I wouldn’t recommend this shoe
3304,62,132,6.6,2024-02-22,user_overall,Kinda bricks ngl only really good thing about these is the traction

3309,62,7,9.0,2023-12-28,traction,The traction pattern covered me in all directions and through all moves.
3310,62,1,8.0,2024-02-27,traction,The outsole tread and grip are the most surprising features. It performs well in all court conditions.
3311,62,112,8.0,2024-01-11,traction,I was impressed with the traction. It doesn't pick up much dust.
3312,62,10,6.0,2024-04-21,traction,"The traction performance is not good. It only has decent performance on the cleanest courts. The outsole is a dust magnet, and I slid a lot."
3313,62,3,8.0,2023-12-28,cushion,The foam is responsive but not the softest. The compression also feels decent.
3314,62,7,7.0,2023-12-28,cushion,"The cushioning starts stiff but softens up. The compression is decent, and the transition is smooth."
3315,62,1,7.5,2024-02-27,cushion,"The Profoam EVA midsole is dense and feels springy. The problem is it feels flat on the floor, and the shank is more stability-oriented."

3317,62,10,7.0,2024-04-21,cushion,The cushioning setup is poor as well. The foam feels stiff and there's not much compression. Responsiveness is the only pro.

3319,62,7,7.5,2023-12-28,materials,The materials feel durable but are not breathable. Most of the shoe is synthetic.
3320,62,1,7.0,2024-02-27,materials,The uppers are more substantial and more forgiving than I thought. Breathability and heat retention are an issue.
3321,62,112,7.0,2024-01-11,materials,"The shoe feels heavy, and the tongue is comfortable. The materials are average, and my only complaint is the breathability."

3324,62,7,8.0,2023-12-28,support,"The rigid internal heel counter keeps your foot secure, and I felt locked down, too."

3356,63,3,8.0,2023-12-28,cushion,The Flow technology emphasizes court feel. It's comfortable but lacks bounce.
3357,63,1,8.0,2023-12-28,materials,The upper is a mix of mesh and TPU panels. The padding is also plush. The only downside is the heat and moisture retention.
3358,63,112,8.0,2023-12-28,materials,"The padding and upper feel comfortable. The materials feel cheap, but it doesn't affect the performance."
3359,63,10,8.0,2024-03-22,materials,I love the upper design and implementation. I wish the quality were better.
3360,63,3,7.0,2023-12-28,materials,The materials are soft but not enough to provide security.

3444,65,1,8.0,2023-12-14,expert_overall,The Adidas D.O.N. Issue #5 is a Jekyll and Hyde type of shoe. I felt quick and snappy but also stiff at the same time. The foam could be better.

Only real negative was the time to break in, it took me three hour+ sessions to really feel like the shoe is working well, but now I really like how it feels. If it doesn’t feel good right outside the box, give it a minute."

3480,66,1,7.0,2023-12-06,cushion,There's FuelCell foam and a top-loaded shank in this cushioning setup. The bounce feels consistent and lightweight.

3499,67,9,8.8,2024-03-22,expert_overall,The Nike LeBron 21 keeps the impressive traction and cushioning from last year. I prefer the knit material on the previous LeBron shoe.
3500,67,112,8.8,2023-10-19,expert_overall,"I think the Nike LeBron 21 is a dope sneaker once it's broken in properly. The traction is top-tier, and the cushioning provides plenty of impact protection."
3501,67,3,8.6,2023-11-22,expert_overall,"The LeBron 21 is Nike's best basketball shoe right now. The cushioning is better, and the traction is excellent."
3502,67,32,8.5,2023-10-08,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 21 is all over the place. The traction and materials disappointed me, but the cushioning and support are incredible."
3503,67,164,9.0,2025-07-15,user_overall,"Good shoes, I switched to them right after G.T. Jump2 and so at first the cushioning seemed harder, but as I got used to it, it's very decent and for me top 3 in my collection after jump2 and all city 13. The leather holds the foot very well and I have never had any problems where I thought I might get injured. I usually play both basketball and volleyball, and for the latter they are a bit heavy, although still elite. I have a wide foot and I took half a size up, it fit perfectly"
3504,67,165,9.5,2023-10-10,user_overall,"this shoe's cushioning maybe below lebron 20. its comfortable as hell bro and the pillow thing on the tongue is perfect. aint very breathable cuz it uses a leather material. traction's the same as bron 20 for me and i like the bron 21's looks, but i prefer bron 20 cuz its cheaper and a lil bit the same as 21."
3505,67,166,9.2,2023-10-23,user_overall,traction was amazing at clean courts but it pick up dusts at the dusty setups you will slide a bit when you dont clean it cushion isnt bouncy as lebron 20 but it has lot more impacy protection and support the materials was nice but the ventilation is poor support is superb it was verry good
3506,67,167,9.4,2024-01-12,user_overall,"I recommend them, I also had them in the dragon pearl color but they were much worse in terms of durability and comfort. Conchiolin fits perfectly on the leg, you can feel the parquet floor very well and they are very soft. Fantastic traction on both clean and dirty floors."
3507,67,168,9.2,2024-01-26,user_overall,I love this shoe so far. My only gripe is that the eye-let for the laces closest to my ankle rubbed pretty bad the first time I wore them. It is a metal like material and wore through my sock. I had them tied pretty tight though and it hasn’t bothered me afterwards
3508,67,7,9.0,2023-10-22,traction,The performance on clean courts is elite. Wipe the outsole every four or five plays on dusty courts to avoid sliding.

3511,67,2,8.0,2023-10-05,traction,"The rubber grips well on a clean court. On a dusty court, you need to wipe. The performance feels nice."
3512,67,10,10.0,2023-10-13,traction,"The traction feels freaking amazing. It's top-tier on clean courts, and it bites through dust well. Don't let the dust build, and you'll be solid."
3513,67,5,9.0,2023-11-25,traction,The traction held its own everywhere I played.
3514,67,6,9.0,2024-01-21,traction,The traction performance is impressive. I had no issues stopping on a dime.

3517,67,3,9.0,2023-11-22,traction,"The translucent rubber gripped harder than the solid, but both performed well. The traction is top-tier."
3518,67,32,7.5,2023-10-08,traction,"I slipped a lot. The traction performance was not good. It picks up a lot of dust on dirtier courts, too."
3519,67,7,9.5,2023-10-22,cushion,The foam is stable in the heel and soft under the forefoot. The Zoom bag also provides excellent impact protection and responsiveness.
3520,67,1,10.0,2023-08-18,cushion,The Zoom units are all you feel. The top-loaded shank also offers plenty of springback. It's a bouncy shoe overall.
3521,67,100,10.0,2023-10-19,cushion,"The cushioning is the best part of the shoe. My feet never hurt. There's no break-in period, and it's soft and comfortable."

3526,67,9,9.0,2024-03-22,cushion,The cushioning feels soft with plenty of impact protection and the forefoot feels bouncy.
3527,67,112,9.0,2023-10-19,cushion,"I felt the heel impact protection immediately, but the bounce didn't come along until three days later. Afterwards, it feels phenomenal."
3528,67,3,10.0,2023-11-22,cushion,"The midsole is the perfect balance between softness and responsiveness. The heel compression provides extra stability, too."
3529,67,32,9.5,2023-10-08,cushion,The cushioning is my favourite part of the shoe. It's balanced to provide soft comfort and firm stability.
3530,67,7,9.5,2023-10-22,materials,"The materials feel nice after an initial break-in period. Breathability is an issue, but the comfort is top-tier."
3531,67,1,9.0,2023-08-18,materials,The upper feels slightly upgraded. It feels comfortable after breaking in. The tongue is the best you can get for breathability and comfort.
3532,67,100,9.0,2023-10-19,materials,"This year's leather material sacrifices breathability for added lockdown and stability. You have to double-knot the laces, though."
3533,67,2,9.0,2023-10-05,materials,"The upper is the main difference between the 21 and the 20. The lockdown feels improved as a result of the leather materials. The tongue offers more ventilation, too."
3534,67,10,8.0,2023-10-13,materials,The materials are thinner than they look. It's supportive and minimal while remaining comfortable. Breathability is the only downside.
3535,67,5,8.0,2023-11-25,materials,"The upper feels soft and velvety. I like how it performs, but I prefer how the 20 plays. I like the premium feeling."
3536,67,6,9.0,2024-01-21,materials,I enjoy the material usage both for performance and quality.
3537,67,9,8.0,2024-03-22,materials,There's a textile layer on top of a flywire layer underneath the main shell of the shoe. It feels extra supportive but requires some break-in time.
3538,67,112,8.0,2023-10-19,materials,"The materials feel great on foot, especially after a break-in period. The laces come undone on occasion, but I love the tongue. It's stiff out of the box, though."
3539,67,3,8.0,2023-11-22,materials,"The attention to detail on the materials is better than other Nike shoes. The shoes are lighter, too."
3540,67,32,8.0,2023-10-08,materials,"The materials are lighter but thicker, stiffer, and not as flexible. It does provide containment during explosive movements, though."
3541,67,7,9.5,2023-10-22,support,"This shoe has one of the sturdiest heel counters. The construction keeps you from sliding over the footbed, too. The overall support feels elite."
3542,67,1,10.0,2023-08-18,support,The construction and lacing system of the shoe are outstanding for keeping you contained.
3543,67,100,9.0,2023-10-19,support,"The Nike Sphere and the tongue keep your heel locked in. There's more forefoot flex with rigidity, too."
3544,67,2,10.0,2023-10-05,support,The lateral support feels better. The grooves and cables on the shoe catch and contain you well. There's also no heel slippage.

3546,67,5,9.0,2023-11-25,support,Support and lockdown feel secure. The lacing system helps customize the security of the shoe around your foot.
3547,67,6,9.0,2024-01-21,support,"The support feels excellent, and I had no issues with instability or lockdown."
3548,67,9,9.0,2024-03-22,support,The support feels good because of the TPU shank plate and upper construction. I would've liked a carbon fibre plate. The lateral containment also feels impressive.
3549,67,112,8.0,2023-10-19,support,I had no issues with heel lockdown. The upper materials also help the shoe feel supportive too.
3550,67,3,8.0,2023-11-22,support,Stability is better this year because of the revamped heel cushioning.
3551,67,32,9.0,2023-10-08,support,The materials wrap your foot and provide lateral containment nicely. Support and lockdown are some of the better features.

3557,67,5,9.0,2023-11-25,fit,"I enjoyed the snug, 1-to-1 fit. I also like the cabling and flywire system."
3558,67,6,8.0,2024-01-21,fit,"The fit is a bit snug, but it's close to 1-to-1."
3559,67,9,8.0,2024-03-22,fit,The fit feels very snug with a slightly narrow toe box.
3560,67,3,8.0,2023-11-22,fit,The fit is pretty bang on.
3561,67,32,8.5,2023-10-08,fit,The shoe feels snug initially but breaks in over time to become more comfortable.
3562,67,7,0.0,2023-10-22,outdoor,The rubber is too soft for outdoor play.
3563,67,1,50.0,2023-08-18,outdoor,These are indoor shoes in my mind.

3569,67,10,2,2023-10-13,width,The shoe feels snug.

3586,68,132,9.4,2023-12-15,user_overall,"Very good shoe. Containment was outstanding, plush but responsive cushion, decent traction, and comfy materials. Also, durability is good for outdoor courts (Tested on). Hoping some cooler colorways come out in this shoe because it is a beastly performer which I will certainly be buying again. Also, it runs ever so slightly snug, so wide footers, look to get this in the 2E width."
3587,68,169,8.4,2023-12-23,user_overall,Fit is a little long but traction is very nice cushion is very surprising. Shoe isnt very bouncy but its comfortable and very very light def in this shoe is very fun as switching def positioning is very easy because of how light the shoe is. Traction very mid would be get outdoors however looks durable and the cushion is nice.
3588,68,170,9.0,2024-03-24,user_overall,Good cushioning but traction pattern is very thick. Good fit and materials.

3591,68,1,9.0,2023-10-10,traction,You get a lot of grip with this traction pattern.
3592,68,86,9.0,2023-11-08,traction,"The traction is very reliable. I never had issues with movement, and I never had to wipe."
3593,68,3,8.0,2023-10-22,traction,The traction works perfectly fine. I had no problems.
3594,68,104,9.0,2023-11-03,traction,The traction feels excellent. I didn't have any issues.
3595,68,10,9.0,2023-11-15,traction,"The traction is surprisingly good after an initial break-in period. It doesn't pick up much dust, either."
3596,68,6,8.0,2024-02-18,traction,The traction performance feels pretty good on clean and dusty courts. I never experienced any issues.
3597,68,1,9.0,2023-10-10,cushion,The cushioning feels lively because the shoe has the most supportive shank. The combination of Fresh Foam and FuelCell combine to provide a balance of bounce and shock absorption.
3598,68,86,9.0,2023-11-08,cushion,New Balance did a fantastic job with this cushioning setup. It provided enough support without sacrificing much court feel.
3599,68,3,9.0,2023-10-22,cushion,"The cushioning exceeded my expectations. The impact protection provides a safe and secure landing every time. There's no break-in time, either."
3600,68,104,8.0,2023-11-03,cushion,The impact protection improves from the V3. The FuelCell and Fresh Foam are stable but not as responsive.
3601,68,10,8.0,2023-11-15,cushion,"The heel is soft and comfortable. The compression feels impressive. There's not much bounce, but the impact protection is solid."
3602,68,6,8.0,2024-02-18,cushion,The cushioning feels very comfortable. There's plenty of impact protection but the high stack creates a lack of court feel.
3603,68,1,8.0,2023-10-10,materials,I love the drag guard. The upper is also light and supportive.
3604,68,86,8.0,2023-11-08,materials,The materials are a solid mix of mesh and synthetics.
3605,68,3,8.0,2023-10-22,materials,The materials are light and flexible.
3606,68,104,8.0,2023-11-03,materials,"The materials get the job done, but they are not premium."
3607,68,10,8.0,2023-11-15,materials,I like how soft and supportive the mesh material feels. The upper setup is comfortable.
3608,68,6,8.0,2024-02-18,materials,The thick mesh feels comfortable on my feet. I have no complaints about the material usage.
3609,68,1,10.0,2023-10-10,support,"The lockdown is comfortable, and the shoe feels secure because of the upper material and lacing system."
3610,68,86,8.5,2023-11-08,support,"The cushioning and traction help add stability to the shoe, and after breaking in the fit, the shoe feels plenty supportive."
3611,68,3,8.0,2023-10-22,support,"The stability and support are decent. I had no issues with lateral containment, too."
3612,68,104,8.0,2023-11-03,support,The sculpting around the heel could be better. The support and lockdown are solid if you manage the fit.
3613,68,10,8.0,2023-11-15,support,"I didn't have any issues with support and lockdown. The materials are supportive, and the lateral stability is solid, too."
3614,68,6,9.0,2024-02-18,support,"I had zero support issues in this shoe. You're covered laterally, and the materials do a great job of containing you."
3615,68,1,9.0,2023-10-10,fit,Fit is one of the best features because New Balance offers multiple widths.
3616,68,86,8.0,2023-11-08,fit,"The forefoot is more snug than the V3. I wish the heel area had more padding, too. Once broken in, the shoe fits well."
3617,68,3,8.0,2023-10-22,fit,The fit feels standard.
3618,68,104,8.0,2023-11-03,fit,The fit feels long and narrow but feels better with a runner's loop.
3619,68,10,8.0,2023-11-15,fit,The shoe fits me well. There's only a bit of extra room at the front of the shoe.
3620,68,6,8.0,2024-02-18,fit,"I have a slightly wide foot, so I needed to break in the snug forefoot area. It feels close to a 1-to-1 fit. I like it."
3621,68,1,50.0,2023-10-10,outdoor,"The durometer is high enough for outdoors, but beware of wearing them down."
3622,68,3,100.0,2023-10-22,outdoor,This shoe is outdoor-friendly.
3623,68,10,50.0,2023-11-15,outdoor,Outdoor play should be fine.
3624,68,6,50.0,2024-02-18,outdoor,The outsole feels durable but I wouldn't use these outdoors.
3625,68,3,3,2023-10-22,width,The width feels average.
3626,68,10,2,2023-11-15,width,The toe box is slightly narrow.
3627,68,6,2,2024-02-18,width,The forefoot is a bit narrow but it breaks in.
3628,68,3,3,2023-10-22,size,I went true to size.
3629,68,10,2,2023-11-15,size,I went up half a size.
3630,68,6,3,2024-02-18,size,The shoe fits true to size.
3631,69,112,8.5,2023-10-22,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 3 provides enough stabilization for all positions. I love the cushioning, and the traction works as long as you wipe the dust."
3632,69,10,8.4,2023-11-11,expert_overall,"I love the Jordan Zion 3. Everything about the shoe is fantastic except for the narrow fit. The traction was solid, and this shoe has my favourite drop-in midsole."
3633,69,7,8.3,2023-11-03,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 3 is one of the best supportive low-top shoes. Jordan Brand knocked the drop-in midsole out of the park, too."
3634,69,1,8.2,2023-10-25,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 3 is a departure from his previous shoes. It's a minimal shoe that maintains the structure, but it's still heavy. The traction and outsole are the best features."
3635,69,5,8.0,2023-10-28,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 3 is made for stockier players who play with pace. All the features perform as intended, but there is a break in period."
3636,69,2,8.0,2023-11-11,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 3 is a minimal shoe with outstanding support and lockdown. I enjoy the drop-in midsole, but the shape and fit of the shoe are off."
3637,69,20,7.6,2024-05-19,expert_overall,The Jordan Zion 3 didn't meet our expectations. The only upside is the cushioning. Jordan Brand takes a step back on this model.
3638,69,3,6.8,2023-12-25,expert_overall,"I'm disappointed with the Jordan Zion 3. The comfort is poor, and there's a lot of pinching because of the fit."
3639,69,172,8.4,2024-02-27,user_overall,"Love cushioning as someone who always needs that cushioning it definitely helps a lot, the ankle support on this shoe is amazing. Two things I do hate about the shoe is the fit & grip, it's narrow & if you have wide feet I recommend going a size up, grip is terrible on a dusty non-hardwood court, once you get on a hardwood court the grip is okay. Recommend these to players that attack the rim a lot during games, if you jump a lot get them. I also use them for volleyball and I recommend them too"
3640,69,173,8.3,2023-11-17,user_overall,"I have skinny feet and this shoe fits me like a glove, it picks up a lot of dust but after a few wipes with your hand and youre good to go. It has a really grippy fit because of the insole (feels like its just grabbing your whole sock) and the support is amazing. It is a little bit tight on the first 3 hours but the second time i wore them they where really confortable."
3641,69,174,8.0,2024-06-21,user_overall,They are good shoes and if you are trying to get soemthing this is a good shoe overall. The fit is a bit tight but other wise it’s perfect if your trying to not roll your ankle
3642,69,132,7.2,2024-02-22,user_overall,WAY TOO NARROW and traction isn't great on dust. Cushion is awesome and super supportive but be prepared to go a full or even maybe 1 and 1/2 sizes up.
3643,69,175,6.6,2024-08-01,user_overall,Good shoe but the traction ruins them as well as the fit of the shoe because of how narrow they are.
3644,69,112,8.0,2023-10-22,traction,Dust pickup is a flaw in the traction. The performance feels solid otherwise.
3645,69,10,9.0,2023-11-11,traction,"The traction is impressive, especially on clean courts. It picks up dust quickly, but it's easy to wipe."
3646,69,7,7.5,2023-11-03,traction,"The traction performs well on clean courts, but dust is a problem. I had to wipe every play to avoid slipping out."
3647,69,1,9.0,2023-10-25,traction,"The outsole tread is my favourite part of the shoe. It grips well after about 5 minutes, and the forefoot feels better than the rearfoot."
3648,69,5,8.0,2023-10-28,traction,I don't think you'll have issues with the traction indoors. I didn't experience much sliding.
3649,69,2,7.0,2023-11-11,traction,"The traction on clean courts has a solid bite, but the outsole picks up dust quickly. The performance is average overall."
3650,69,20,8.0,2024-05-19,traction,"I had to wipe the outsole way too often on dusty courts. It performs well on clean courts, though."
3651,69,3,7.0,2023-12-25,traction,The traction on my pair was not consistent. The performance is below average.
3652,69,112,9.0,2023-10-22,cushion,"I love the drop-in midsole. The Formula 23 feels soft, and the forefoot Zoom feels bouncy."
3653,69,10,9.0,2023-11-11,cushion,"This shoe has one of my favourite drop-in midsoles. The Formula 23 is comfortable underfoot, and I appreciate the forefoot Zoom unit."
3654,69,7,8.5,2023-11-03,cushion,"The cushioning is a drop-in midsole. It feels nice underfoot, and I enjoy the Formula 23 foam. The Zoom bag feels springy, too."
3655,69,1,7.0,2023-10-25,cushion,"The drop-in midsole has a flexible shank and a chunky Zoom Air unit in the forefoot. It feels bouncy. I also enjoy the Formula 23 foam, but the tech specs translate to comfort instead of performance."
3656,69,5,8.0,2023-10-28,cushion,"The drop-in midsole is fit for heavier players. There's not much court feel, but the Zoom is impressive."
3657,69,2,8.0,2023-11-11,cushion,I like the improvement of the Formula 23 foam. The drop-in midsole is plush and bouncy. It's also minimal and low to the ground.
3658,69,20,9.0,2024-05-19,cushion,The drop-in midsole reminds me of the Kobe 11. The impact protection is impressive. I'm pleasantly surprised with the balance.
3659,69,3,8.0,2023-12-25,cushion,The drop-in midsole is thick but flexible. It's one of the bright spots of the shoe.
3660,69,112,8.0,2023-10-22,materials,The padding feels great. The materials are decent overall. My only concern is breathability.
3661,69,10,8.0,2023-11-11,materials,I like how the upper materials feel. The shoe feels thin and supportive. Ventilation could be better.
3662,69,7,8.5,2023-11-03,materials,"I like the materials performance-wise, but the quality is nothing special."
3663,69,1,9.0,2023-10-25,materials,"There's a lot of reinforcements to the upper. The materials are comfortable, too."
3664,69,5,8.0,2023-10-28,materials,The textile upper performs as expected. It's thin enough to move and thick enough to feel supportive.
3665,69,2,9.0,2023-11-11,materials,"The upper materials feel supportive, and it doesn't stretch."
3666,69,20,6.0,2024-05-19,materials,"The upper is flexible enough for free movement, but the side panels need a break-in period. The quality feels cheap, and the shoe makes weird noises."
3667,69,3,6.0,2023-12-25,materials,The materials are hard and stiff. The shoe didn't feel comfortable around my foot.
3668,69,112,9.0,2023-10-22,support,"The lockdown is tight and secure, especially when laced up. The support feels beefy, too. There's a lot of extra reinforcement."
3669,69,10,9.0,2023-11-11,support,There are a lot of features to keep you contained laterally. The support and lockdown are solid. I had no issues with heel lockdown either.
3670,69,7,9.0,2023-11-03,support,"The heel counter is rigid and sturdy. The material also houses your feet within the shoe well. I love the outriggers, too."
3671,69,1,8.0,2023-10-25,support,There's virtually no heel slippage. The medial and midfoot flanges also provide incredible stability.
3672,69,5,8.0,2023-10-28,support,"The lockdown feels good because of the snug fit. The extra reinforcements provide tons of support, but the shoe feels stiff."
3673,69,2,9.0,2023-11-11,support,"The overlays and lateral materials provide plenty of support and containment. The stability is pleasantly surprising, too."
3674,69,20,8.0,2024-05-19,support,The lockdown is decent. The TPU elements offer plenty of containment despite the tightness.
3675,69,3,7.0,2023-12-25,support,Support and stability take a step back from the Jordan Zion 2.
3676,69,10,7.0,2023-11-11,fit,"The fit felt weird. The length feels perfect, but the width is too narrow. It squeezes the side of my foot."
3677,69,7,8.0,2023-11-03,fit,The fit is incredibly snug and narrow.
3678,69,1,8.0,2023-10-25,fit,The fit works best for narrow feet. The reinforcements and shape make the fit cramp for wide-footers.
3679,69,5,8.0,2023-10-28,fit,"Initially, the fit feels tight and snug. I enjoyed it after breaking in the shoe."
3680,69,2,7.0,2023-11-11,fit,The shoe feels narrow. The plastic on the lateral side hugs your foot too much.
3681,69,20,7.0,2024-05-19,fit,My foot felt nice in the shoe because of the textured drop-in midsole. The upper construction causes some discomfort. I had to experiment with the laces a lot for a good fit.
3682,69,3,6.0,2023-12-25,fit,"I think the fit will turn down a lot of players. It feels tight and snug in the toe box, and the width causes pinching and soreness."
3683,69,10,50.0,2023-11-11,outdoor,The rubber is good enough for outdoor play.
3684,69,7,50.0,2023-11-03,outdoor,"The materials seem durable enough for the outdoors, but the shoe is not meant for toe draggers."
3685,69,1,0.0,2023-10-25,outdoor,Keep these shoes indoors for better longevity.
3686,69,5,0.0,2023-10-28,outdoor,I recommend staying inside with these shoes.
3687,69,7,1,2023-11-03,width,These are one of the narrowest shoes.
3688,69,1,2,2023-10-25,width,Look elsewhere if you have wide feet because of the shoe's shape.
3689,69,5,1,2023-10-28,width,The forefoot is narrow. I don't recommend this shoe for wide-footers.
3690,69,2,1,2023-11-11,width,The width is very narrow.
3691,69,3,1,2023-12-25,width,The width is very narrow.
3692,69,7,2,2023-11-03,size,"I went true to size, but I recommend going up half a size. The fit is too snug when going true to size."
3693,69,1,2,2023-10-25,size,Narrow feet can go true to size. Medium feet can go up half a size.
3694,69,5,3,2023-10-28,size,The shoe fits true to size.

3697,70,176,9.5,2024-01-11,expert_overall,The Anta KT 9 is one of my top shoes this year. The traction and cushioning are outstanding. None of the features disappoint.
3698,70,112,8.5,2023-11-08,expert_overall,"The Anta KT 9 is suitable for the 1-3 positions. It has fantastic heel impact protection, and the support is solid. My only gripe is the breathability."

3702,70,176,10.0,2024-01-11,traction,"Anta hit with this outsole. This shoe has some of the best traction I tested in the last few seasons. I barely had to wipe, even in dirty conditions."
3703,70,112,8.0,2023-11-08,traction,"The traction picks up dust, and I had to wipe frequently. I didn't slide out. Performance on clean courts is top-tier, though."

3706,70,176,10.0,2024-01-11,cushion,The full-length nitrogen-infused cushioning is my favourite feature of the shoe. This setup is the closest that a foam has come to feeling like Zoom.
3707,70,112,9.0,2023-11-08,cushion,"Cushioning is my favourite feature of the shoe. The Nitro foam feels responsive. The heel impact protection is impressive, too."
3708,70,10,8.0,2023-11-15,cushion,The Nitro foam feels low to the ground and has solid impact protection. The shoe is better suited for responsiveness.
3709,70,1,9.5,2023-11-17,cushion,"The heel foam provides lots of impact protection, while the forefoot Nitrogen-infused foam feels responsive. I've never experienced impact protection like the KT 9."

3720,70,1,7.0,2023-11-17,fit,"I did not appreciate the fit because of how narrow the taper becomes. It works for players who prefer a slim and snug fit, though."
3721,70,10,0.0,2023-11-15,outdoor,The grooves are too thin for outdoor use.
3722,70,1,0.0,2023-11-17,outdoor,I wouldn't recommend using these shoes outdoors.

3738,71,23,8.0,2023-12-18,traction,"Traction might be the shoe's best feature. The setup is grippy and offers top-notch directional coverage. It's not elite, but it is versatile."
3739,71,1,8.0,2023-12-06,traction,The outsole tread is my favourite part of the shoe. The pattern grabs courts nicely.
3740,71,10,6.0,2023-12-06,cushion,"The cushioning setup sucks. Court feel is average, and the impact protection is not good."
3741,71,3,8.0,2023-12-06,cushion,"The cushioning has tons of heel compression. The midsole feels soft, too. I experienced no discomfort."
3742,71,23,7.0,2023-12-18,cushion,"The Phylon midsole and Air Max unit under the heel feel stable and reactive. It's less plush, but it feels decent."

3744,71,10,8.0,2023-12-06,materials,"The mesh material gets dirty easily, but it's thin and breathable. It conforms to your foot well."
3745,71,3,8.0,2023-12-06,materials,"The netting material is light and breathable. The foamy collar is comfortable, too."
3746,71,23,7.5,2023-12-18,materials,"The materials feel a lot sturdier than the Witness 7. It provides improved containment and durability, but the quality isn't the best."
3747,71,1,7.0,2023-12-06,materials,"The textile overlay and caging provide decent comfort. The tongue is not breathable, and the shoe traps moisture."
3748,71,10,8.0,2023-12-06,support,"Support and lockdown are adequate. Lateral containment is decent, too."
3749,71,3,7.0,2023-12-06,support,"The upper does not provide enough stability, so be cautious."
3750,71,23,7.0,2023-12-18,support,"Thanks to the upgraded materials, the support is also improved. The shoe feels secure on the court, an improvement from the last model."
3751,71,1,6.0,2023-12-06,support,"The upper containment is iffy, and there's not enough side-to-side support."
3752,71,10,9.0,2023-12-06,fit,"The shoe fits me very well. The length of the shoe is perfect, and the toe box is snug."
3753,71,3,8.0,2023-12-06,fit,I had no issues with the fit.
3754,71,23,8.0,2023-12-18,fit,The fit feels snug. It might be the second-best feature of the shoe.

3756,71,10,50.0,2023-12-06,outdoor,Durability is questionable. It seems decent enough for outdoor play.

3763,72,3,8.2,2023-12-06,expert_overall,"The Li-Ning Wade Shadow 5 is a decent performer, especially for a budget shoe. Stability is the best feature, while traction and cushion take some time to warm up."

3765,72,1,7.8,2023-12-06,expert_overall,"The Li-Ning Wade Shadow 5 is better for outdoor use. The shoe caters to larger, more powerful players that can generate more force for traction and cushioning."
3766,72,180,7.5,2024-08-08,user_overall,"I take mia regular size but my feet cant enter in the shoes of the boom's insoles are in them. I have tò remove them and play without Any insoles. Those shoes is very tight. The worst part Is that After One outdoor game, the rubber of the traction start tò brake. Seriosly...Pieces of Rubber start cut and now After One week the traction Is flat and with a lot of scuffs..."
3767,72,181,9.2,2024-03-28,user_overall,"Traction was great, shoes were comfortable to wear even though it took a few games to break in. Feels good outdoors and even better indoors. Got a discount but I think it would still be worth full price. Great option for courts where traction can be a problem."

3769,72,3,8.0,2023-12-06,traction,The traction becomes better with more playtime. It becomes satisfactory but isn't top-tier.
3770,72,10,8.0,2024-01-15,traction,I needed to break the traction in during the first few runs. It performs solidly afterwards.
3771,72,1,7.0,2023-12-06,traction,The traction is better laterally than linearly.
3772,72,3,8.0,2023-12-06,cushion,"The Boom insole feels better than standard insoles, and the cushioning feels decent."
3773,72,10,8.0,2024-01-15,cushion,The cushioning setup feels nice. There's a decent amount of impact protection and compression while sacrificing some court feel.
3774,72,1,7.0,2023-12-06,cushion,"The shank and tread bridge make the cushioning feel extra springy. The Boom foam provides decent step-in comfort. Be prepared for your sock to stick to the insole, though."
3775,72,3,8.0,2023-12-06,materials,"As a budget model, this shoe is heavier than most others from Li-Ning. The materials also feel stiff but perform well."
3776,72,10,8.0,2024-01-15,materials,I like the feel of the textile material. It feels comfortable and thin.
3777,72,1,8.0,2023-12-06,materials,The materials are dense and reinforced to offer additional structure and containment.
3778,72,3,9.0,2023-12-06,support,The highlight of the shoe is the upper stability and lockdown.
3779,72,10,9.0,2024-01-15,support,I'm good to go with the support and lockdown. I had no issues with lateral stability.
3780,72,1,9.0,2023-12-06,support,"The lockdown is tremendous, and there's no heel slippage. The tread bridge provides extra stability, too."

3782,72,10,7.0,2024-01-15,fit,"The shoe is annoying to put on. The texture on the insole grabs your sock, too. I like the snug toe box, though."

3791,73,3,8.0,2023-07-24,expert_overall,"The Adidas Trae Young 3 has bouncy cushioning and consistent traction, but the heel slippage and stability subtract from the overall performance."
3792,73,1,8.0,2023-08-13,expert_overall,"The Adidas Trae Young 3 is a niche shoe. It's best for lightweight, bouncing players. The cushion is soft and bouncy, while the traction grips. Beware of the durability outdoors."
3793,73,23,8.0,2023-09-16,expert_overall,The Adidas Trae Young 3 is a massive improvement. It feels light and reactive. The best features are the grippy outsole and stability. The main downside is the lack of impact protection for heavier players.
3794,73,10,8.0,2023-11-03,expert_overall,"The Adidas Trae Young 3 is a solid performer, but I didn't enjoy how bulky it is. The cushioning feels good, and the stability is better than expected, though."

3801,73,3,9.0,2023-07-24,traction,"The outsole was immaculate on clean courts, but there was a minor drop in performance on dusty courts. It's still solid, though."
3802,73,1,9.0,2023-08-13,traction,The traction performs better than expected. The grip feels very good. The rubber will grab the court. You have to trust it.
3803,73,23,8.0,2023-09-16,traction,The traction is grippy and covers you in multiple directions. Beware of dust pickup.
3804,73,10,7.0,2023-11-03,traction,"After breaking the traction in, it performs well. Dust can cause some sliding."
3805,73,112,9.0,2023-08-25,traction,Traction is my favourite part of the sneaker. You can stop on a dime. It's top-tier.
3806,73,3,9.0,2023-07-24,cushion,"The foam feels soft and bouncy, especially in the heel. There's plenty of good feedback when moving, too."
3807,73,1,8.0,2023-08-13,cushion,The cushioning feels bouncy underfoot but feels more geared towards shock absorption.
3808,73,23,8.0,2023-09-16,cushion,The cushioning is low to the ground while remaining bouncy and reactive.
3809,73,10,8.0,2023-11-03,cushion,"The cushioning is one of my favourite features. The compression is solid, and there's plenty of impact protection. I enjoy the step-in comfort, too."
3810,73,112,8.0,2023-08-25,cushion,"The cushion feels responsive under the forefoot, and I have no issues with the impact protection, either. The foam feels soft."
3811,73,3,8.0,2023-07-24,materials,The upper is a standard textile. There's more flexibility and less weight this year.
3812,73,1,7.0,2023-08-13,materials,"The upper is more traditional. The tongue is thin, which makes lacing uncomfortable. I had a hard time breaking these materials in."
3813,73,23,8.0,2023-09-16,materials,The upper takes time to break in. It conforms well to your foot afterwards.
3814,73,10,8.0,2023-11-03,materials,The materials are slightly stiff but supportive. It also feels comfortable and minimal.
3815,73,112,7.0,2023-08-25,materials,"The materials conform to feet nicely, but there's a bit of pressure on top of your foot. I'm not impressed with the quality and comfort, though."

3817,73,1,8.0,2023-08-13,support,The midfoot shank provides lateral stability. It's an incredibly stable shoe.
3818,73,23,9.0,2023-09-16,support,Support might be the shoe's best feature. The shoe's base and torsional plate provide plenty of stability.
3819,73,10,9.0,2023-11-03,support,"Surprisingly, the support and lockdown are solid. Lateral stability felt good, too."
3820,73,112,8.0,2023-08-25,support,I didn't have issues with heel lockdown. I felt safe and secure in this shoe. The lockdown and containment felt good.
3821,73,3,7.0,2023-07-24,fit,Heel slippage is an issue if you don't go down half a size. I'm also not a fan of the laces either. The fit is okay.
3822,73,1,8.0,2023-08-13,fit,The shoe takes a while to break in before feeling comfortable. Beware if you have a flat foot. You might need an orthotic.

3824,73,10,8.0,2023-11-03,fit,"The Trae Young 3 fits well, and the toe box feels normal."

3834,74,104,8.6,2023-09-28,expert_overall,"The Puma MB.03 is my favourite performer in LaMelo's signature line. The fit feels great, the materials are improved, and the traction is elite."

3837,74,1,8.2,2023-11-11,expert_overall,"The Puma MB.03 is such a comfortable shoe. The foam is forgiving, and I enjoy the upper material setup. The main downside is the weight."
3838,74,5,8.0,2023-12-09,expert_overall,"If you like consistency, consider the Puma MB.03. LaMelo Ball's line is consistent. All of the features work well together."
3839,74,10,7.8,2023-11-08,expert_overall,"I didn't enjoy playing in the Puma MB.03. Puma took steps back with the materials, traction, and cushioning. Support and lockdown are impressive, though."
3840,74,187,9.2,2024-04-24,user_overall,"I've worn the Puma MB03 LaFrance colorway for the past half a year on the outdoor court. The Durability was surprisingly good enough to bring this badboy out. The traction though, after wearing around for 5-6 times It started to losing the grip it usually had. but It was not a big deal, If you wear this badboy on the concrete outdoor court. The traction is fabulous, the bite is great, the squeak is loud, If you considered to buy one of these. I recommend you to grab a pair due to it uniqueness!"
3841,74,188,9.0,2024-10-28,user_overall,"The Mb.03s have been my favorite shoe for a while now. Even though the outsole does pick up alot of dust the traction is still good as long as you're ok with making wipes. My favorite part of the shoe is the support my foot never moved out of place. I definitely recommended as a 6' 2"" 200lb forward."
3842,74,189,8.2,2024-02-27,user_overall,Overall great fit and comfort but slippery on dusty courts. Might get better with break in over time

3845,74,7,9.0,2023-11-11,traction,It doesn't matter if you're on clean or dirty surfaces. This traction pattern will hold you down. Just make sure to wipe the dust.
3846,74,104,10.0,2023-09-28,traction,"The traction performance is elite. The grip felt great, no matter the court surface."
3847,74,112,8.0,2023-11-08,traction,"The traction picks up lots of dust, but if you wipe it, the performance is solid."
3848,74,3,8.0,2023-09-28,traction,"Dust pickup is an issue. It doesn't slide out, and the performance is still solid, though."
3849,74,1,8.0,2023-11-11,traction,The outsole tread is my favourite part of the shoe. It feels physically tacky.

3851,74,10,7.0,2023-11-08,traction,"The traction doesn't perform well. It's decent on clean courts, but dust causes lots of sliding."
3852,74,7,8.5,2023-11-11,cushion,"The cushioning is plush after you break it in. The foam sits high off the ground, so you lose some court feel."
3853,74,104,7.0,2023-09-28,cushion,"The Nitro foam setup is the same as the MB.02. Impact protection is a highlight, but there isn't much court feel."
3854,74,112,9.0,2023-11-08,cushion,I love the Nitro foam cushioning. It feels great on foot.
3855,74,3,8.0,2023-09-28,cushion,"The cushioning is the same setup, but it feels slightly softer. The foam is better for impact protection than bounce."
3856,74,1,8.0,2023-11-11,cushion,"The Nitro foam is less dense, so it feels more forgiving. It's more catered towards shock absorption and stability."
3857,74,5,8.0,2023-12-09,cushion,The Nitro-infused foam feels comfortable during play. It has a decent balance of protection and court feel.
3858,74,10,8.0,2023-11-08,cushion,"The full-length Nitro offers solid impact protection, but you're high off the ground. The court feel and responsiveness are reduced."

3860,74,104,9.0,2023-09-28,materials,"The materials are the main upgrade. The textile upper is soft and supportive. There's no break-in time, and I had no issues with upper flexibility."
3861,74,112,8.0,2023-11-08,materials,"Materials are soft, and the step-in comfort is solid. The mesh isn't breathable because it's heavy-duty."

3863,74,1,8.0,2023-11-11,materials,The upper is substantially built and padded. The downside is the shoe will hold onto moisture.
3864,74,5,8.0,2023-12-09,materials,I prefer the mesh material on the MB.03 to the last model. It's comfortable after a break-in period.
3865,74,10,7.0,2023-11-08,materials,I'm not a fan of the stiff upper. It's durable but not soft.
3866,74,7,9.0,2023-11-11,support,The heel counter and rubber outsole provide plenty of stability. The extra overlay materials also help keep you secure on the footbed.
3867,74,104,8.0,2023-09-28,support,Everything is stable because of the fit. It's sturdy and rigid but lacks flexibility.
3868,74,112,8.0,2023-11-08,support,I have no issues with heel lockdown or stability.
3869,74,3,9.0,2023-09-28,support,Stability and support are better than most low-top shoes on the market.
3870,74,1,9.0,2023-11-11,support,The offset lacing offers better lockdown. The upper construction also helps keep you secure and contained.
3871,74,5,8.0,2023-12-09,support,"I like the security of the heel counter, and I had no issues with lockdown."
3872,74,10,9.0,2023-11-08,support,The support and lockdown are outstanding. You're good to go. My only complaint is the slight heel slippage.
3873,74,7,9.0,2023-11-11,fit,The fit is 1-to-1. There's no extra room or volume. It feels snug.
3874,74,104,9.0,2023-09-28,fit,The 1-to-1 fit is another highlight of the shoe. There's zero dead space around the shoe.
3875,74,3,8.0,2023-09-28,fit,My true-to-size feels secure while not being too tight.
3876,74,1,8.0,2023-11-11,fit,"The fit is much more forgiving than previous LeMelo shoes. I needed no break-in time, and the shoe accepts orthotics well."

3878,74,10,8.0,2023-11-08,fit,"I like a snug fit, and I enjoyed the fit of the MB.03."

3891,75,1,8.6,2023-09-28,expert_overall,"The 361 AG 4 takes some breaking in, but they play like a maximalist shoe with soft cushioning and support. I enjoyed the shiftiness it provides for being a beefier shoe."

I love the holographic Curry logo spliced with the Yin and Yang on the tongue of the shoe. I haven't tried these on the court yet but I'm sure I'll love these as I am familiar of how Under Armour's new lineup of sneakers with Flow will perform. The only downside is the weird sizing. It may just dethrone my 4 Flotro as my favorite pair of Currys one day."

4038,78,200,8.4,2024-02-03,user_overall,Have these in the aunt pearl colourway. Traction is insane have to wipe because of dust pick up though. Cushion is good. Bounce springy forefoot set up with zoom and the long shank plate. The air strobes and cushlon wasn’t elite but was good. No large outrigger so I did roll my ankle a few times but the shoe is still fine. Chances are you won’t roll your ankle unless you are in an awkward situation. Fits slightly long. Great shoe would recommend for more forwards and centers than gaurds.
4039,78,201,9.2,2024-03-01,user_overall,"The KD 16 is another great performer from the KD Line. The traction is amazing on clean courts, but does pick up some dust. The cushion is the perfect cushion for a basketball shoe. A large-volume Zoom Air Unit in the fore-foot, and a Large Air unit in the heel, plus a TPU plastic shank plate give you a great mix of plush and responsive cushioning.  Support doesn't lack anything, and keeps you locked in the shoe. The only real issue with these, is that they run narrow, so go a half size up."
4040,78,202,8.9,2024-02-18,user_overall,"Great shoe overrall bud really sensitive to dust, i had to wipe every now and then when playing in dusty courts. In indoor courts and clean courts they grip like a glue on the floor! Great durability for outdoor too if you have an agile footwork type of playstyle (outer rubber is softer though than actual rubber so go xdr if playing outdoors) experience no slippage too but it's going to be bad for wide feet as it hurts my medial side and also this shoe traps a lot of moisture!"
4041,78,203,8.8,2024-04-17,user_overall,"The kd 16 by no means are a bad shoe. In particular I love the colourway and performance of the shoe. However compared to previous models, like the 13s, 14s, and 15s I feel like the performance is subpar compared to the performance of the other models. But still a great shoe in the rotation."
4042,78,204,8.5,2024-01-05,user_overall,"Best for players who would exchange court feel for comfort, the shoe is comfortable but as someone who wants to get the ground off quick and love court feel, this isn’t the best shoe for me (court feel is not bad at all, I just like more responsiveness)"
4043,78,32,9.0,2023-08-16,traction,"The traction provides solid multidirectional coverage after a break-in period, but breaking them in was rough."
4044,78,9,9.0,2024-03-22,traction,The traction performs decently well. My translucent outsole option performed excellently on clean courts.
4045,78,112,8.0,2023-08-18,traction,"The traction feels decent for the most part. It performs well on most courts, but it's not top-tier."
4046,78,10,8.0,2023-08-25,traction,The traction improves the more you play in the shoe. The performance is just below top-tier. Dust hinders the traction a bit.
4047,78,7,8.0,2023-10-05,traction,You won't have issues with clean indoor courts. I had to wipe every few plays on dirty courts.
4048,78,2,8.0,2023-09-22,traction,"The rubber compound is pliable, providing solid performance. The grip feels nice."
4049,78,5,9.0,2023-08-18,traction,"The traction was solid. It had my movements covered in multiple directions, and I enjoyed the outer wrapping."
4050,78,3,9.0,2023-09-12,traction,"Dust pickup and hard stops are not an issue. It's not as grippy as the KD 15, but the performance is still excellent."
4051,78,6,8.0,2024-01-15,traction,"The traction performed well after I broke the rubber in. The bite is solid on clean courts, but dust can cause slipping. Avoid playing on dusty courts."
4052,78,1,8.0,2023-07-24,traction,It takes about 10 minutes to warm up the traction to get a solid grip. It works well but isn't the best for powerful lateral cuts.
4053,78,32,9.5,2023-08-16,cushion,"The cushioning is excellent. The combination of the Air Strobel and forefoot Zoom Air offers responsiveness, impact protection, and comfort."
4054,78,9,9.0,2024-03-22,cushion,The Air Strobel and forefoot Zoom Air unit feel comfortable. It's soft with extra impact protection. I like the performance on the court.
4055,78,112,10.0,2023-08-18,cushion,The cushioning is my favourite part of the sneaker. The Cushlon and Air Strobel feel incredibly bouncy underfoot.
4056,78,10,9.0,2023-08-25,cushion,"I like the Air Strobel unit under the heel, and the forefoot Zoom unit feels bouncy. The foam is soft and comfortable, too."
4057,78,7,8.5,2023-10-05,cushion,"The cushioning setup feels plush and comfortable, but I prefer last year's cushion."
4058,78,2,8.0,2023-09-22,cushion,"Performance-wise, the cushioning feels good. It feels plush with plenty of impact protection. It's also feels bouncy in the forefoot."
4059,78,5,8.0,2023-08-18,cushion,"The cushioning is comfortable, but there's not a lot of court feel. It felt firm initially, so I had to spend more time breaking them in."
4060,78,3,8.0,2023-09-12,cushion,"The cushioning takes time to break in. The heel is soft, and the forefoot becomes bouncy over time."
4061,78,6,9.0,2024-01-15,cushion,The cushion feels phenomenal. I love the balance between court feel and impact protection.
4062,78,1,8.0,2023-07-24,cushion,"The foam is Cushlon, and there's a rearfoot Air Strobel too. There's also a forefoot Zoom Air bag. It has shock absorption, but I prefer the Zoom Strobel."
4063,78,32,8.5,2023-08-16,materials,"The materials feel similar to the KD 15, but the shoe is bulkier and heavier. It's padded and doesn't take any break-in period."
4064,78,9,9.0,2024-03-22,materials,"The textile mesh is well-ventilated and requires no break-in time, which I appreciate."
4065,78,112,8.0,2023-08-18,materials,The padding and materials are comfortable on foot. I especially enjoy the tongue setup.
4066,78,10,8.0,2023-08-25,materials,"The quality isn't worth the price. It gets the job done when playing, though. The upper feels minimal and supportive."
4067,78,7,7.5,2023-10-05,materials,The materials are nothing special. They break in nicely and feel breathable.
4068,78,2,8.0,2023-09-22,materials,There's no break-in time with the upper materials. It feels comfortable immediately.
4069,78,5,8.0,2023-08-18,materials,"There's a minor break-in period, but the mesh is flexible and breathable."
4070,78,3,8.0,2023-09-12,materials,"The materials don't hinder performance, but they aren't the best. Breathability isn't good, either."
4071,78,6,8.0,2024-01-15,materials,The materials feel fine. The performance feels solid.
4072,78,1,8.0,2023-07-24,materials,"The materials feel comfortable, but the plastic pieces are broad."
4073,78,32,9.5,2023-08-16,support,"The support feels great because of the midfoot panel and the base stability of the shoe. I didn't have containment issues, either."
4074,78,9,9.0,2024-03-22,support,The TPU side panels contain your foot through all lateral movements. I enjoy the torsional support as well.
4075,78,112,9.0,2023-08-18,support,"There's no heel slippage with the KD 16. The overall support, lockdown, and stability feel excellent."
4076,78,10,8.0,2023-08-25,support,Support and lockdown were good for me. I felt contained and stable. My foot wasn't leaving the footbed at all.
4077,78,7,9.5,2023-10-05,support,"The heel counter is sturdy and keeps your foot in place. The plastic wings also offer additional rigidity, and the base is stable."
4078,78,2,9.0,2023-09-22,support,"The upper materials, particularly the plastic wings, keep you locked in and secure. I had no issues with lateral containment."
4079,78,5,8.0,2023-08-18,support,"The heel containment is improved, and the support is solid."
4080,78,3,8.0,2023-09-12,support,Torsional support and lateral containment are solid. Heel lockdown could be better.
4081,78,6,8.0,2024-01-15,support,"The support performed well after I cranked down on the laces. Without a tight lace setup, there's some heel slippage."
4082,78,1,7.0,2023-07-24,support,You have to crank the laces to get lockdown. The heel containment could be better too.
4083,78,32,9.0,2023-08-16,fit,The shoe feels snug but loosens up over time.
4084,78,9,8.0,2024-03-22,fit,The shoe fit is snug.

4089,78,3,8.0,2023-09-12,fit,"The shoe is short length-wise, and it provides a snug fit."
4090,78,6,8.0,2024-01-15,fit,The fit is comfortable after playing a few games.
4091,78,1,8.0,2023-07-24,fit,The fit is forgiving but stubby. You have to tie down the laces tightly for a contained fit.
4092,78,9,0.0,2024-03-22,outdoor,I don't recommend these shoes for outdoors.
4093,78,112,0.0,2023-08-18,outdoor,I wouldn't take these shoes outdoors.

4115,79,23,8.2,2023-11-25,expert_overall,The Nike Giannis Immortality 3 is an impressive budget shoe. It's a solid pick suited well for outdoors. The cushioning and materials are improved.
4116,79,10,8.2,2023-09-28,expert_overall,"The Nike Giannis Immortality 3 is a minimal, quick, and responsive shoe. The cushioning could be softer and more plush, but the traction feels excellent."

4119,79,1,7.6,2023-12-09,expert_overall,The Nike Giannis Immortality 3 feels lively and springy. The materials and midsole likely hold up better for lighter guards. It caters to shifty players well because of the weight and traction.
4120,79,116,8.8,2024-01-10,user_overall,I love the Immortality 3!! As we in Brazil don't have the chinese brands the 3° Immortality is a gret 
4121,79,147,7.0,2024-05-14,user_overall,I did not like the immortality 3 because of the way it felt on foot. I wore a friends pair and did not like them. They were kind of heavy and the traction was about average. The cushion provided decent impact protection but had almost no bounce. Court feel was almost nonexistent but support was great. Overall I was kind of disappointed in the performance of the immortality 3 but if you can deal with its flaws it’s an decent budget shoe.
4122,79,141,8.9,2024-10-09,user_overall,I really liked the shoe…my foot is narrow and king so it fit well…the laces are good too..and I liked the traction. Good and squeaky and the coulourways stand out in the court..I liked the design 
4123,79,205,8.2,2024-03-11,user_overall,"The tractions perforrms outstandingly well even on dust and it seems very durable. It fits a bit narrow. Cushioning is the biggest downside, even as a light 5'9 I experienced noticable foot pain during practises. Overall exelent shoe for its price (I picked it up for only 40$, which is dirt cheap."
4124,79,71,6.6,2024-08-03,user_overall,"Got these just to be able to ball while being on holidays. Buy em just because of budget concerns, and even then you could probably find something better. Just too bulky for a swift player like myself"
4125,79,23,8.0,2023-11-25,traction,The updated traction pattern performs well.
4126,79,10,10.0,2023-09-28,traction,The traction feels freaking amazing after a few runs. It's close to top-tier.

4131,79,10,7.0,2023-09-28,cushion,The foam feels soft and responsive. Impact protection could be better.
4132,79,3,8.0,2023-08-18,cushion,The midsole feels responsive and soft for a budget shoe.

4150,79,10,50.0,2023-09-28,outdoor,"The rubber feels durable, but the grooves are thin. The shoe should be okay for outdoor play."

4170,80,169,7.9,2023-11-25,user_overall,Traction wasn’t sticking but to be fair the gym was the dustiest that ive ever seen it. I also didnt use the grip sprits so i’ll update this review for next time i play other than the traction sliding i really enjoyed the shoe
4171,80,207,8.6,2024-01-21,user_overall,"the heel slippage at first is kinda bad, recomend buying a newer color way, break in, or buying a grip socks if you acidentally bought the old color way"

4194,80,9,8.0,2024-03-22,materials,"The materials remind me of Flywire. It feels stiff around the outrigger, but it breaks in."
4195,80,2,8.0,2023-08-23,materials,The upper is screen mesh with heavy use of fuse. It helps add durability and support but has a break-in time. It feels plasticky but softens up as you play.
4196,80,7,7.5,2024-07-25,materials,"Materials are a basic setup, but the upper breaks in quickly. It works on the court."
4197,80,5,8.0,2024-06-02,materials,"The quality could be better, but I can't argue for this price. I like how the shoe feels on foot, especially the laces."

4203,80,2,8.0,2023-08-23,support,"The shoe felt supportive during play, and I felt secure laterally. Heel lockdown is okay, not the best. There's no heel slippage, though."
4204,80,7,9.0,2024-07-25,support,The heel counter does a fantastic job of locking your foot down. There's also a lot of lockdown from the suspension cables on the sides of the shoe.
4205,80,5,8.0,2024-06-02,support,I didn't have issues with lockdown. I think it would've been better if I picked a smaller size.

4208,80,19,8.0,2023-12-19,fit,There's some space in the forefoot length-wise because I couldn't get my regular half-size.
4209,80,6,8.0,2024-06-02,fit,"The fit feels decent and snug. I felt some pressure around the midfoot, but it didn't hinder me much."
4210,80,2,8.0,2023-08-23,fit,"The midfoot feels snug because of the foam from the midsole wrapping upwards, but I had no issues with the fit."
4211,80,7,8.0,2024-07-25,fit,"I had some extra length at the front of my shoe, but there were no issues. The fit is snug, and I enjoyed it."
4212,80,5,7.0,2024-06-02,fit,"The fit felt tricky for me. The shoe fits snugly on the sides, but there's too much length for my preferences."
4213,80,1,50.0,2023-08-21,outdoor,I think you can wear these shoes outdoors.
4214,80,9,100.0,2024-03-22,outdoor,The solid rubber options are durable enough for outdoor use.

4227,81,7,8.9,2023-11-08,expert_overall,"I enjoyed the Nike Sabrina 1. I didn't have to think when playing, which I loved. The traction and cushioning are excellent, and the support is near perfect."
4228,81,86,8.5,2023-09-29,expert_overall,"The Nike Sabrina 1 is a solid first signature shoe. The shoe caters to shifty, ground-based players. My only gripe is I wish the React foam felt softer."

4236,81,2,8.0,2023-10-13,expert_overall,The Nike Sabrina is a solid performer and a minimal sneaker. It's better for players with low-to-the-ground play styles because of the thin cushioning and grippy traction.
4237,81,3,7.8,2023-11-11,expert_overall,"The Nike Sabrina 1 has inconsistent traction and a snug fit, but playing with this cushioning setup is enjoyable."
4238,81,83,9.0,2024-12-25,user_overall,I’ve got to say the Sabrina 1s are one of the best shoe
4239,81,169,7.5,2023-10-05,user_overall,The shoe was very long and tight traction was its one bright side but shooting and driving felt very awkward even when I went true to size or even up half a size just a very awkward fitting shoe. Also shooting was very hard because of how hard it was to transition to your toes in the shoe.
4240,81,171,8.8,2023-11-02,user_overall,"Great shoe overall. The traction is amazing, but picks up dust. Wiping every once in a while is a must. The support really surprised me. My foot was locked in, and it fit perfectly. I highly recommend them."
4241,81,210,8.8,2025-04-20,user_overall,Great Shoe for almost all positions. However does tend to rip somewhat easily. Traction is Great and cushion takes break in time. Go true to size for sure.

4259,81,1,7.5,2023-09-20,cushion,"The foam is React, and there's also a double-thick shank. It's better for shock absorption than bounciness."
4260,81,19,8.0,2024-01-21,cushion,You can feel the top-loaded Zoom bag easily. I also like the React foam.
4261,81,6,9.0,2024-01-17,cushion,I like how the cushioning feels. It feels quick without sacrificing impact protection.

4275,81,7,9.0,2023-11-08,support,The lateral wrap reminds me of the Kobe 5. It houses your foot in the shoe well. The base and outrigger also provide lots of stability.
4276,81,86,9.0,2023-09-29,support,The support comes directly from the fit and sizing because of how the shoe is built.
4277,81,5,9.0,2023-09-20,support,The lockdown is exceptional. I enjoy the heel counter and how it feels like my foot is pulled into the back of the shoe.

4318,82,10,8.0,2023-10-19,expert_overall,"The Nike G.T. Hustle 2 is a smooth and nimble-feeling shoe. There's a lot of court feel, and the cushioning feels well-rounded, too. The material quality is the main downside."
4319,82,1,7.8,2023-09-20,expert_overall,The Nike G.T. Hustle 2 is a lightweight and bouncy performer. The cushioning and outsole setup make getting up and down the court easier.
4320,82,2,7.8,2023-09-28,expert_overall,"There's a lot of promise with the Nike G.T. Hustle 2, but it misses the mark slightly. The shoe plays low and responsive thanks to the full-length Zoom cushioning."

4326,82,3,9.0,2023-09-20,traction,The outsole pattern is unique. It has a solid grip. The overall performance felt great.
4327,82,7,8.5,2023-09-28,traction,"The traction performs nicely on clean courts, but the outsole collects plenty of dust on dirty courts."
4328,82,86,8.0,2023-09-21,traction,"The traction sticks like no other on clean courts, but dust pickup hinders the performance."

4331,82,1,8.0,2023-09-20,traction,"The tread is the most unique part of the shoe. The transition is nice, but it doesn't have a continuous grip. It performs well on indoor courts."
4332,82,2,7.0,2023-09-28,traction,"The traction feels like a gimmick. It plays well on a clean court, but the lack of surface area can cause slipping on dusty courts."
4333,82,3,9.0,2023-09-20,cushion,The midsole reminds me of the KD 15. It's a responsive setup with plenty of bounce. The step-in comfort is the most impressive feature.
4334,82,7,9.0,2023-09-28,cushion,"The Cushlon takes some time to break in, and the full-length Zoom Strobel keeps you close to the court while feeling plush."
4335,82,86,9.0,2023-09-21,cushion,The combination of full-length Zoom and Cushlon foam is stellar. It feels low to the ground while providing plenty of feedback.
4336,82,112,8.0,2023-10-10,cushion,"The cushioning is a highlight of the sneaker. The foam feels firm, but the Air Strobel makes up for it."

4344,82,10,7.0,2023-10-19,materials,"The material quality is poor, but it feels good enough performance-wise. It's thin and minimal."

4348,82,7,6.0,2023-09-28,support,"The laces, ankle area, and base combine to provide decent support. My main concern is the complete lack of a shank for midfoot support."

4353,82,2,8.0,2023-09-28,support,"I wish there were additional lateral support around the pinky-toe area, but the support is adequate for lighter players. I enjoy the lateral outrigger, too."

4355,82,7,8.5,2023-09-28,fit,The fit is 1-to-1. I needed to use an additional eyelet after the materials softened up.
4356,82,86,7.0,2023-09-21,fit,I had to lace the shoe to the top for a safe fit. The collar can pop and cause an injury without the top lace hole.

4381,83,214,8.9,2023-11-04,user_overall,"While the Zoom Freak 1 will remain my favorite silhouette, the ZF5 is the best performer to date. This shoe is a perfect blend between the Freak 1 and 2. The great lockdown, low profile, focus on heel cushioning, and flexibility from the ZF1 blended with the Forefoot zoom and midsole aesthetics from the ZF2. The shoe leans slightly towards impact protection, but still provides plenty of bounce. The traction in the heel was the perfect use for Nike’s new smear traction setup from the GT Cut 2."

The traction is quite average if the court is dusty, but if it is clean, it feels quite confident. But unfortunately, both of my sneakers broke in the same place, on the sole near the balloons. Also, if you take a white colorway, be aware that if you dive for balls on the floor, the cushions near the ankle rub very much or the court and they are no longer possible to clean."

4455,84,1,10.0,2023-07-21,cushion,The Jump Frame combined with the React under the heel and the forefoot Zoom Air makes it incredibly easy to get off the ground in this shoe. It's plenty bouncy too.
4456,84,112,10.0,2023-07-30,cushion,"The cushioning is the best I've ever felt on any basketball shoe. The energy return from the Zoom Air units is unreal, and the React foam is very comfortable."

4458,84,10,9.0,2023-08-31,cushion,"Nike's use of React, Zoom units, and the Jump Frame feels unreal underfoot. The bounce and comfort are ridiculous. This isn't the best setup for responsiveness and court feel, though."
4459,84,20,9.0,2024-03-22,cushion,The cushion feels like Nike stuffed all their tech in it. This shoe is the best for impact protection.

4494,85,10,8.6,2023-09-03,expert_overall,The Way of Wade 808 line is one of my favourites. The 808 3 Ultra has responsive cushioning and top-tier traction performance. Impact protection could be better.

4497,85,217,9.2,2024-04-26,user_overall,Very nice shoe for a fast player who likes a lot of changes of direction and velocity. By the way the shoe fits you very small and very narrow so I recommend going half a size up. Materials are good nothing special. The cushion it’s very comfortable. The best thing is traction in my opinion. This shoe when you start using it might make you pain for the fit but 2/3 times using it and you’re all right. I had no issues with this shoe.
4498,85,218,9.0,2024-01-22,user_overall,This was very amazing shoe and i play always on dusty courts but the grip was amazing. And the best thing was cushion for me because it was so soft and so comfy but less impact protection. Outdoor was best so far that i tested so durable and grips well on outdoor courts almost didn't pick up dust. If you're goin to buy this shoe it will be good option for 160$.
4499,85,219,7.0,2023-11-24,user_overall,Very good shoe although the traction on the chemical reaction was horrible. Couldn’t play a game with out slipping and sliding around. Picks up so much dust.
4500,85,220,8.4,2024-10-05,user_overall,Definitely for quick guards. Plays low like a Kobe only issue I had was impact protection. I jump high and landing with minimal cushion kinda hurts sometimes.
4501,85,150,9.4,2024-02-03,user_overall,"Great overall shoe, drop in midsoles allow for crazy opportunities, toes did feel like they were getting crushed at times though"

4507,85,2,9.0,2023-08-28,cushion,You sit low to the ground because of the thin midsole. The full-length Boom foam still provides bounciness and subtle impact protection.
4508,85,3,9.0,2023-08-28,cushion,The Ultra uses a full-length Boom drop-in midsole. It feels soft underfoot while providing solid feedback for responsiveness.
4509,85,10,8.0,2023-09-03,cushion,"The drop-in midsole provides soft compression, especially under the heel. It's thin under the forefoot, so there's a lot of court feel."

4519,85,10,9.0,2023-09-03,support,You're good to go with the lateral containment. The outrigger also provides a lot of stability.

4521,85,1,9.0,2023-08-28,support,Lockdown feels very good. The lateral containment is also a highlight.

4526,85,2,0.0,2023-08-28,outdoor,I wouldn't suggest using these shoes outside.
4527,85,10,50.0,2023-09-03,outdoor,The herringbone pattern seems durable enough.
4528,85,1,50.0,2023-08-28,outdoor,The rubber held up well to my tests.
4529,85,10,2,2023-09-03,width,The width is slightly narrow.

4535,86,23,8.5,2023-07-19,expert_overall,"The Jordan Luka 2 has a reactive and responsive setup better suited for shiftier guards. The traction grips well, and the cushioning caters to lighter players."
4536,86,32,8.4,2023-07-22,expert_overall,"The Jordan Luka 2 feels like a standard hoop shoe. The changes to the shoe are catered toward bigger guards. The support and lockdown are sturdy, but the shoe is also heavier."
4537,86,7,8.4,2023-08-30,expert_overall,The Jordan Luka 2 has outstanding midfoot and lateral support and containment. It's a solid shoe for guards and wings.
4538,86,1,8.2,2023-07-11,expert_overall,"The Jordan Luka 2s are at their best when shifting weight onto one foot, particularly for stepbacks and cuts. The support and lockdown are the best features."

4542,86,221,8.0,2023-08-26,expert_overall,The Jordan Luka 2 is a definite improvement from the Luka 1. It's a controlled ride with lots of stability and sturdiness. There's plenty of value at this price point.
4543,86,71,7.4,2023-10-19,user_overall,"These felt great at the shop but I had the same issue, both times when trying them out on court. Skin on my left foot in the Achilles area would get damaged causing irritating pain so much that I couldn’t play on. Maybe it’s just my personal problem having a strange foot shape, or perhaps them being half a size too small for me. Anyways, this didn’t happen with any other shoe, so hence the bad rating and me eventually selling them and going on to the next one."
4544,86,116,8.5,2024-01-10,user_overall,I loved the SECURITY of the Luka 2!! Is my favorite 
4545,86,94,8.4,2023-11-12,user_overall,"The Luka 2 has some of the best support in a Nike shoe I’ve played in. The traction is super sticky on clean courts, but on dust the traction is poor and needs wiping. The cushion is super soft but will take a little brake in time. The materials are supper supportive, but take a decent amount of break in time to make them less stiff."
4546,86,31,7.2,2024-11-28,user_overall,"It feel little heavy and the laces you need to carefully tie them. From my own experience, It hurts my mid foot sometimes and I don't like that but overall, Luka 2 still a solid shoes"

4550,86,32,9.0,2023-07-22,traction,"The traction felt tacky on clean hardwood courts straight out of the box. You have to wipe frequently because of dust pickup, though."
4551,86,7,8.5,2023-08-30,traction,The traction pattern is tried and true. You're covered on clean courts. Make sure to wipe every few plays on dusty courts.
4552,86,1,8.0,2023-07-11,traction,"The side-to-side traction is impressive, but going front-to-back is just average."
4553,86,100,8.0,2023-08-23,traction,"The traction performs very well on cleaner courts, but it mildly suffers when there's dust."
4554,86,112,8.0,2023-07-17,traction,"The traction was outstanding on clean courts, but dusty floors caused problems."
4555,86,10,8.0,2023-08-16,traction,"The traction feels amazing on clean courts. It picks up dust often, which hinders performance."

4565,86,221,7.0,2023-08-26,cushion,"The Formula 23 foam feels better than last year, but the cushioning is still not as good as other foams. Your feet won't hurt, but the shoe feels basic."

4576,86,23,9.5,2023-07-19,support,"Support and lockdown see the most upgrades. The upper keeps you secure and contained, while the beefed-up heel counter makes sure you're stable. This means a longer break-in time, though."

The traction is just perfect in the forefoot (make sure you get a colorway whit a translucent outsole), although is not as good in the heel. The cushion is high but it feels fantastic with the nitrofoam insole. Only concern should be lateral support because the shoe is high, narrow and doesn’t have an outrigger, but it should be ok for guards."

However after just 2 games, the plastic support on the distal broke down/cracked. Right after, I started seeing the netting break down on the medial, rendering the show useless. If the customers shoes and players shoes are identical as advertised, there is no way this shoe doesn't completely fall apart every time Jayson Tatum wears them. I should state that I am 6’4 and around 190 lbs.Faulty design overall."

4987,94,250,8.8,2023-06-24,user_overall,Shoe is close to perfection. The only complaints I have are very small. The material is a little cheap and takes time to break in. The material will feel better over time. Also make sure to wipe the outsole on dusty courts. If you don’t you will be okay but will for sure slip out on EXTREMELY aggressive moves.
4988,94,130,9.2,2023-08-05,user_overall,"The traction and cushion is amazing. It fits slightly long. The outsole is really durable. Dust doesn't affect the traction. The upper material could've been better. But overall, great performance"

5056,96,10,10.0,2023-08-18,support,Support and lockdown are phenomenal. I was good to go right away for lateral containment. The materials and harness line system keep you contained.
5057,96,112,9.0,2023-09-04,support,"The heel lockdown feels decent, while the lacing system is unique and impressive. The lockdown around your foot is phenomenal."
5058,96,2,9.0,2023-08-18,support,The lacing system and its lockdown are some of the shoe's best features. It's a harness system that pulls your foot down securely.
5059,96,1,8.0,2023-08-18,fit,The shoe envelopes your foot during lacing. The length feels a bit long.
5060,96,10,8.0,2023-08-18,fit,"The fit feels very snug, how I like it. My arches felt slight pain after prolonged periods of play."

5067,96,112,3,2023-09-04,width,Wide footers should be okay because of the lacing system.
5068,96,2,2,2023-08-18,width,A word of caution for people with wide feet. This shoe is kind of narrow.

5077,97,256,8.7,2023-07-05,user_overall,"The best thing about this shoe is the cushioning, and the worst thing is the kinda weird fit/support. I've worn size 12 in all westbrook models, but this is the first pair where I feel like I should have gone half a size down. It feels easy to roll an ankle in, and I don't feel great on sharp cuts. They feel super bouncy however, thanks to the nice air zoom setup, and the traction is reliable. If you get the hard rubber colorways, you can use them outdoors just fine."
5078,97,257,10.0,2024-01-25,user_overall,"My feet have always been too wide for size 10.5 but too short for size 11. However these shoes are the first pair of shoes to ever fit my feet perfectly!

5079,97,258,7.8,2023-09-09,user_overall,"Fun shoe to play with. Traction was great on clean courts, however on dust it was bad. Support is great. I went half size down and it was good. Durability is not very good as they started falling apart on me after 2 months. Overall not to bad, but for price there are better options."
5080,97,215,8.2,2023-12-20,user_overall,"I don’t understand the hate behind this shoe, the only let down is the heel cushioning and it’s just no where near as good as you would think for a 200 dollar shoe"
5081,97,259,9.0,2023-05-31,user_overall,"I'm blown away by these. Easily my favourite Why Not model to date. Soooo comfortable, great traction and a great fit. Shoe of 2023 so far for me."
5082,97,1,8.0,2023-03-07,traction,"The traction is much better compared to last year's model. The rubber takes 5-10 minutes to warm up, but it plays well."
5083,97,2,8.0,2023-03-21,traction,The traction performance impressed me. It even gripped dusty courts. I enjoyed playing in them.
5084,97,3,8.0,2023-05-01,traction,"The traction isn't the sharpest, but you can come to hard stops consistently."
5085,97,7,7.5,2023-05-04,traction,"I had no issues with lateral cuts, but I slipped a bit on forward motions."
5086,97,10,7.0,2023-04-13,traction,"The traction performed poorly initially, but after breaking them in, the performance improved on clean courts. I don't recommend the shoe for dusty courts."

5089,97,3,8.0,2023-05-01,cushion,"I had no issues with the cushion setup. The transition is excellent, and you feel low to the ground."
5090,97,7,7.0,2023-05-04,cushion,"The Phylon midsole offers some springiness, but it will bottom out. The Zoom bag provides impact protection for the forefoot, though."
5091,97,10,7.0,2023-04-13,cushion,"I like the Zoom unit under the forefoot, but it bulges up. There's not a lot of compression with the foam. The court feel is average."
5092,97,1,8.0,2023-03-07,materials,"I like the combination of materials on the upper. The ripstop helps with durability, but the shoe isn't too breathable."
5093,97,2,8.0,2023-03-21,materials,The straps and lacing system are sturdier than expected. Ventilation is better than expected too.
5094,97,3,8.0,2023-05-01,materials,The minimal upper provides excellent breathability.
5095,97,7,6.5,2023-05-04,materials,"The materials feel nice on your feet, and the shoe is breathable. It's nothing special, though."

5100,97,7,9.0,2023-05-04,support,"I had no issues with the support. The heel counter is rigid. The midsole keeps you contained, and the base is stable. The shroud hugs your foot nicely too."
5101,97,10,8.0,2023-04-13,support,"The lateral containment felt good, but my foot didn't feel locked down. Stability wasn't an issue."
5102,97,1,8.0,2023-03-07,fit,I found the fit long. The excessive materials also put a minor strain on the feet. Good fit overall.

5121,98,112,8.2,2023-04-27,expert_overall,"The Nike Ja 1 is an impressive initial shoe for Ja Morant. The traction works for me, and the cushioning is a pleasant surprise. I recommend this pair to any player."
5122,98,2,8.2,2023-05-14,expert_overall,"The Nike Ja 1 is a pleasant surprise. The traction is impressive, the cushioning is decent, and the support provides everything I need."
5123,98,20,8.2,2023-06-25,expert_overall,The Nike Ja 1 is an impressive debut shoe. It feels similar to the Kyrie Low 5. I recommend these for both guard positions because of the cushioning and traction setup.
5124,98,32,8.0,2023-04-26,expert_overall,"The Nike Ja 1 disappointed me because of my high expectations. The traction is inconsistent, and the comfort and cushioning are lacking. The shoe is playable, though."
5125,98,3,8.0,2023-05-11,expert_overall,"The Nike Ja 1 is a solid performer. Not many features perform poorly. The traction excels, but the cushioning could be more comfortable."
5126,98,100,8.0,2023-05-31,expert_overall,"The Nike Ja 1 is straightforward and reliable. The performance surprised me, especially the cushioning. The traction is also serviceable on multiple surfaces."
5127,98,6,8.0,2024-01-23,expert_overall,"The Nike Ja 1 is a solid performer outside of the narrow fit. The traction feels very good, and the cushioning caters to shifty players."
5128,98,1,7.8,2023-03-07,expert_overall,"The Nike Ja 1 plays bouncier than expected. The cushioning profile looks flat and offers explosiveness. The traction can be iffy indoors, but it still performs decently."
5129,98,169,8.6,2023-09-17,user_overall,The ja’s had amazing traction picked up a little dust but nothing compared to the lebron 20s as far as dust pick up as i picked up much less dust in the ja’s. The ja’s have so much bounce in that forefoot i was surprised on how high i got up with such little effort. Shooting in this shoe was awkward and so was lateral movement on defense however I feel like it wouldve gotten better the more i broke in the shoe so don’t take that one to heart overall really good shoe for a really good price.
5130,98,94,9.2,2024-07-20,user_overall,"The Ja 1s are the perfect shoe for any guard who is athletic and likes to score. The traction is really squeaky and bites through dust pretty well but does require a wipe occasionally because these shoes do pick up a solid amount of dust the cushion is crazy though, the forefoot zoom air is bouncy and the phylum is soft and has great impact protection. Support was good because it was well padded around th ankle area. Materials were comfy but not the most premium. Fit was like a gloveandverynice."
5131,98,260,9.5,2023-09-07,user_overall,"The Nike Ja 1 is an amazing shoe! Aside from the fact that it is narrow its a great all around shoe. It is slightly small if not true to size, great traction, (best I've ever had.) Good cushion, not the most breathable but definitely bearable, better than the average shoe. Very light with great materials. The most styles shoes Iv'e ever worn! Great durability, I use it for outdoors all the time. Also Ja Murant is one of my favorite players, If you like him to then get the shoe! (Just do it!)"
5132,98,261,8.5,2024-01-03,user_overall,"The best part about this shoe for me is the cushion. I feel a lot bouncier when jumping especially for high flyers. Traction is grippy but every now and then need to wipe the bottom with your hands. Materials are breathable and support is good. The fit is a little wider towards the toe box but not too crazy, good for wide footed people like me. Overall good shoe would recommend for shifty, fast or bouncy guards."

5134,98,5,10.0,2023-08-18,traction,The traction sticks like glue.
5135,98,10,10.0,2023-05-04,traction,The traction feels insane. It's top-tier. It bites through dust well.
5136,98,7,9.5,2023-05-02,traction,The way the traction performs is amazing. It has you covered in all directions. This pattern feels on par with the LeBron 20.
5137,98,112,8.0,2023-04-27,traction,"I experienced some slipping when making hard cuts, but the traction works perfectly for smaller movements."
5138,98,2,9.0,2023-05-14,traction,The traction performance is a highlight. The grip is phenomenal.
5139,98,20,9.0,2023-06-25,traction,The traction pattern is multi-directional and jagged. It gets the job done well. The shoe grips a lot of surfaces.
5140,98,32,8.0,2023-04-26,traction,"The outsole tread pattern is dense, making it hard to grip the floor. It also picks up a lot of dust. The performance is better outdoors than indoors."
5141,98,3,9.0,2023-05-11,traction,The traction is impressive. The rubber grips the floor really well.
5142,98,100,8.0,2023-05-31,traction,"After breaking the traction in, I had no issues with the performance. It's not the best, but it's serviceable."
5143,98,6,9.0,2024-01-23,traction,The traction on the shoe feels very good. I stopped on a dime.
5144,98,1,7.0,2023-03-07,traction,"The outsole tread is my least favourite part of the shoe. The pattern is dense, making it hard to get them to grip indoors. The performance is phenomenal outdoors, though."
5145,98,5,9.0,2023-08-18,cushion,You can feel the forefoot Zoom. It's noticeable and smooth. There's also a solid amount of court feel.
5146,98,10,8.0,2023-05-04,cushion,I enjoyed the injected Phylon midsole. It feels soft and provides adequate impact protection.
5147,98,7,7.0,2023-05-02,cushion,"The cushioning is the shoe's biggest letdown. You can feel the cushioning, but it's nothing special."
5148,98,112,9.0,2023-04-27,cushion,The Phylon feels soft and offers decent impact protection. I can also feel the Zoom unit in the forefoot. It reminds me of the Kyrie and Kobe line of shoes.
5149,98,2,8.0,2023-05-14,cushion,You can feel a bit of bounce in the forefoot because of the small Zoom unit. It's a responsive setup with some impact protection.
5150,98,20,8.0,2023-06-25,cushion,The cushioning is typical for a budget Nike shoe. The impact protection in the forefoot is better than the heel.
5151,98,32,7.5,2023-04-26,cushion,"The cushioning feels hard and flat. I barely felt the Zoom Air too. It's responsive, but it doesn't feel too good."
5152,98,3,7.0,2023-05-11,cushion,"There's a decent amount of impact protection, and responsiveness isn't bad. I wouldn't consider this a bouncy shoe."
5153,98,100,8.0,2023-05-31,cushion,"The cushion setup is a pleasant surprise. It's serviceable enough for most people. The Phylon feels plush, and the forefoot Zoom helps when jumping and running hard."
5154,98,6,7.0,2024-01-23,cushion,The cushioning is meant for quicker players. There isn't much impact protection.
5155,98,1,9.0,2023-03-07,cushion,"The Ja 1 uses a plain midsole. It's mainly Phylon with a forefoot Zoom Air unit. The cushioning feels flat underfoot, but it's bouncy."
5156,98,5,8.0,2023-08-18,materials,The synthetic leather and mesh combo feels standard. It's a safe and proven combination.
5157,98,10,8.0,2023-05-04,materials,The materials conform to your foot well and feel minimal and supportive. The padding is also comfortable.
5158,98,7,6.5,2023-05-02,materials,The materials are cheap because of the pricing. It doesn't take away too much from the performance.
5159,98,112,8.0,2023-04-27,materials,The materials and padding feel good. The setup is dope for a first sneaker. It's lightweight and breathable.
5160,98,2,8.0,2023-05-14,materials,"The upper feels basic with mesh and synthetic materials. However, the performance is solid."
5161,98,20,8.0,2023-06-25,materials,"Breathability is subpar. The materials are nothing special, but the assembling quality is solid. The shoe feels lightweight and minimal."

5163,98,3,8.0,2023-05-11,materials,"The materials feel a bit cheap. The padding is comfy, and performance isn't affected, though."
5164,98,100,7.0,2023-05-31,materials,"The materials feel cheap. It feels rough, but breathability is solid. It's also a lightweight shoe."
5165,98,6,8.0,2024-01-23,materials,"I can't complain about the materials from a performance perspective. The quality could be better, though."
5166,98,1,8.0,2023-03-07,materials,The upper is jersey material and synthetic leather. It provides a lot of freedom but not as much lateral support. It's an exceptionally breathable shoe.
5167,98,5,9.0,2023-08-18,support,The lockdown is solid.
5168,98,10,9.0,2023-05-04,support,"The shoe feels incredibly supportive. My foot was not moving around in the shoe. I wasn't coming off the footbed, either."
5169,98,7,9.5,2023-05-02,support,"In my experience, the support is nothing short of amazing. The design is very supportive."
5170,98,112,8.0,2023-04-27,support,I had no issues with heel lockdown or the overall support.
5171,98,2,8.0,2023-05-14,support,I felt supported by the upper. My ankle was locked down too. The lacing system also does a solid job with containment.
5172,98,20,9.0,2023-06-25,support,The shoe has impressive lockdown and containment. You don't slide during play.
5173,98,32,9.0,2023-04-26,support,"The shoe is flat and feels very stable. You don't feel wobbly at all, and the lockdown is there."

5175,98,100,8.0,2023-05-31,support,"I felt contained when playing in the Ja 1. The torsional rigidity is solid, and the synthetic overlays cradle your feet nicely."
5176,98,6,8.0,2024-01-23,support,"I had zero issues with the support in the Ja 1. I had no heel slippage, and the containment felt good, too."
5177,98,1,7.0,2023-03-07,support,"You won't slip out of the shoe, but the containment isn't the best. If you get the right size, the support will work."
5178,98,5,9.0,2023-08-18,fit,The fit is one of my favourite areas of the shoe. It hugs your foot the more you play.
5179,98,10,9.0,2023-05-04,fit,The shoe fits me well because I enjoy a snug fit. The toe box is really snug.
5180,98,7,9.0,2023-05-02,fit,"There's not a lot of volume, so there's no dead space. It's a 1-to-1 fit for me."

5182,98,2,8.0,2023-05-14,fit,The fit is snug. I enjoyed the shape and how the shoe felt around my foot.

5184,98,32,7.5,2023-04-26,fit,"The shoe conforms nicely to your foot, but the fit feels snug out of the box."
5185,98,3,8.0,2023-05-11,fit,I had no issues with the fit overall. The padding in the heel does push against your ankle a bit.
5186,98,100,9.0,2023-05-31,fit,"My favourite part of the shoe is the fit. I felt secure and comfy, especially around my heel."
5187,98,6,8.0,2024-01-23,fit,"The narrow fit caused a lot of pressure in the forefoot area, but it does feel comfortable and secure."
5188,98,1,8.0,2023-03-07,fit,"The fit provides a solid feel around the foot, and the materials expand nicely."
5189,98,10,50.0,2023-05-04,outdoor,The durability on my colourway feels solid.
5190,98,7,50.0,2023-05-02,outdoor,This feels like a viable outdoor option.

5195,98,1,50.0,2023-03-07,outdoor,"The shoe performs well outdoors, but the rubber isn't going to last long."
5196,98,7,2,2023-05-02,width,Go up half a size if you have a wide foot.
5197,98,112,4,2023-04-27,width,The shoe feels wider than other sneakers.
5198,98,2,3,2023-05-14,width,Wide-footers might have to go half a size up.
5199,98,20,1,2023-06-25,width,The shoe is narrow out of the box. I don't recommend these shoes for wide-footers.
5200,98,3,2,2023-05-11,width,The shoe is not as wide as I thought it would be.
5201,98,6,2,2024-01-23,width,The width feels narrow. I suggest going up half a size if you have wide feet.

5211,99,19,8.6,2023-03-12,expert_overall,"I love playing in the New Balance Kawhi 3. The upper is supportive, the traction performs on clean courts, the fit is perfect, and the cushioning is versatile."
5212,99,10,8.2,2023-03-07,expert_overall,"The New Balance Kawhi 3 is a good performer but an overpriced shoe. The cushioning is responsive and low to the ground, and the traction plays well on clean courts."
5213,99,112,8.0,2023-03-07,expert_overall,"The New Balance Kawhi 3 has solid basketball features, but I advise wearing thicker socks because of the heel portion of the shoe. Impact protection and traction performed well."
5214,99,104,8.0,2023-05-10,expert_overall,"The New Balance Kawhi 3 is an optimal shoe for playing outdoors and for players who enjoy support. The FuelCell cushioning feels stiff, but the other features make it worthwhile."

5216,99,19,8.0,2023-03-12,traction,"On clean courts, the traction plays amazingly. The rubber seems too pliable to grip dirtier courts, though."
5217,99,10,8.0,2023-03-07,traction,The traction needs to break in before the performance improves on clean courts. It's not good on dusty courts.
5218,99,112,9.0,2023-03-07,traction,The traction performs nicely. I had no issues whatsoever.
5219,99,104,8.0,2023-05-10,traction,"The traction works. You have to wipe on dusty courts, but you'll still be satisfied."
5220,99,19,9.0,2023-03-12,cushion,"The midsole takes some time to soften up. Once it's broken in, it feels like the best of the Kawhi line of shoes. The impact protection and the court feel great."
5221,99,10,8.0,2023-03-07,cushion,"The FuelCell midsole is soft in the heel, and the foam offers a subtle bounceback."
5222,99,112,9.0,2023-03-07,cushion,The softness of the FuelCell foam was my favourite part of the shoe.
5223,99,104,7.0,2023-05-10,cushion,"The FuelCell midsole is stiff. It's not plush, either. It offers stability and some snappiness."

5225,99,10,8.0,2023-03-07,materials,"The materials feel cheap and synthetic, but the performance feels comfortable."
5226,99,112,7.0,2023-03-07,materials,"The padding around the heel is lackadaisical. The rest of the materials are comfortable, but the shoe isn't too breathable."
5227,99,104,8.0,2023-05-10,materials,"The combination of mesh and synthetic materials is soft, and they break in nicely. It's also well-padded."
5228,99,19,8.0,2023-03-12,support,"The stiffer internal heel counter and contour provide solid stability and support. The shoe is stable overall, but I wanted some extra lateral stability."
5229,99,10,8.0,2023-03-07,support,"The heel lockdown is not the best, but I was good to go for lateral containment and stability."
5230,99,112,8.0,2023-03-07,support,"There is no heel slippage, and I didn't have support issues."
5231,99,104,9.0,2023-05-10,support,The support and stability feel like a tank without being too stiff.

5235,99,104,8.0,2023-05-10,fit,"The heel and midfoot feel awesome, but I had extra room in the forefoot."
5236,99,10,100.0,2023-03-07,outdoor,The durability is solid because of the thick grooves and rubber on the outsole.
5237,99,112,50.0,2023-03-07,outdoor,The rubber and grooves are thick enough to take outdoors.
5238,99,10,2,2023-03-07,width,The toe box is snug.
5239,99,112,3,2023-03-07,width,The shoe seems wide-foot friendly.

5241,99,112,3,2023-03-07,size,"I could have gone down half a size for a snug fit, but I went true to size."
5242,100,1,9.0,2023-04-11,expert_overall,The Li-Ning Way of Wade All City 11 is a fast shoe. They have a lot of pop and feel springy. All positions can benefit from this setup.

5245,100,112,8.4,2023-04-13,expert_overall,"I have no problems recommending the Way of Wade All City 11 as a performance shoe, especially on clean courts. It plays and feels similar to a Kobe shoe. Just be careful on dusty courts."
5246,100,3,8.2,2023-04-13,expert_overall,"Li-Ning's Way of Wade All City 11 is another strong performance shoe from the brand. The smooth transition with each step is the best part. The traction takes some breaking in, though."
5247,100,7,8.1,2023-05-17,expert_overall,"I enjoyed playing in the Li-Ning Way of Wade All City 11. My favourite features are the cushion, fit, and support. The traction was a letdown because of the dust performance."
5248,100,263,8.3,2023-07-18,user_overall,"This shoe is good if u need a pair for outdoors. Traction works really well but will need to wipe after a few plays on dusty courts, these will work really well on outdoor courts. The cushion is nice, you may need to break it in but after the full length boom will feel really nice. The materials feel really nice on feet. The shoes feel really nice on feet, you do need to half size up if wide footed to have a good time with these. But over all do recommend these shoes"
5249,100,264,9.1,2023-04-06,user_overall,"The way of wade all city 11 is an amazing shoe that you should pick up. The traction is amazing and you won’t have trouble outdoors, because the rubber is hard and when I tried it out, there was no damage unlike some of the curry line. The cushion is amazing, and I absolutely love it. Highly reccomended shoe, and you should pick it up if it fits your price point. I went true to size and it was fantastic. Overall amazing shoe, great pickup for outdoor players."
5250,100,265,9.6,2023-07-19,user_overall,"Really good overall basketball shoes. With great traction and also cushioning after a hard landing. I can easily recomand them to anyone which is a point guard, but it also good for bigger guys. The fit is also amazing just maybe a little bit narrow on the forefoot but i would still recomand going true to size if you dont have wide feet."
5251,100,266,9.0,2023-09-03,user_overall,"Traction is very good on clean courts and has a very pronounced squeak. Cushion is the best quality of this shoe, its very bouncy and comfortable. If you're a wide footer I'd recommend going up half a size just as an insurance policy for a great fit."
5252,100,170,9.4,2024-02-16,user_overall,"Great shoes from Li-Ning and Dwayne Wade. It is a very consistent and great all-round shoe, no flaws. Traction is amazing, and the cushioning is amazing. They aren't amazing on dusty courts, but they are still extremely good."
5253,100,1,8.0,2023-04-11,traction,"I have a love/hate feeling with the shoe. The initial grip is some of the best indoors, but the shoe picks up dust quickly."

5258,100,7,6.5,2023-05-17,traction,"On clean courts, you'll have no issues. Dust causes you to slide a lot with this traction, though."

5270,100,7,7.0,2023-05-17,materials,"The material is forgiving, breathable, and strong. I think it could be more premium, though."
5271,100,1,10.0,2023-04-11,support,The materials make the All City 11s one of the most stable-feeling shoes. The double shank also provides tons of stability.

5273,100,2,9.0,2023-03-21,support,The outsole and materials keep you contained laterally. I enjoy the feeling of the setup. The heel lockdown also feels good.

5276,100,7,9.0,2023-05-17,support,The back of the shoe has tons of support with the heel counter. The midsole also wraps up to offer containment.

5278,100,10,8.0,2023-03-21,fit,"The length is perfect, but the toe box stretches out over time."

5286,100,112,0.0,2023-04-13,outdoor,I would not take these shoes outdoors.

5298,101,10,7.4,2023-04-13,expert_overall,The Under Armour Spawn 5 would be a banger if the traction were better. It's a responsive shoe with comfortable cushioning and support.
5299,101,3,8.0,2023-04-13,traction,"The outsole is not squeaky, but I had no issues with performance on clean or dusty courts."
5300,101,10,6.0,2023-04-13,traction,You need to break the traction in before the performance improves. It's nothing special on clean courts and even worse on dusty courts.
5301,101,3,8.0,2023-04-13,cushion,"The cushioning is comfortable, smooth, and low to the ground with lots of court feel. Micro-G is an underrated cushion."
5302,101,10,8.0,2023-04-13,cushion,"The Micro-G cushioning is soft; it's my favourite aspect of the shoe. The court feel is solid, and impact protection is there."

5304,101,10,7.0,2023-04-13,materials,The quality of the materials is crappy. It's comfortable and doesn't take away from performance much.

5314,102,1,8.4,2023-04-29,expert_overall,"The Son of Flash plays extremely fast. The first step of the shoe is explosive because of the foam and shank setup, and the herringbone traction pattern helps with stops."
5315,102,3,8.3,2023-04-13,expert_overall,"I consider the Li-Ning Wade Son of Flash an amazing shoe for the price. The traction is grippy, and the cushioning is good enough for most players. There are also no issues with the support."
5316,102,2,8.2,2023-04-13,expert_overall,The Li-Ning Son of Flash is ideal for outdoor use because of the thick rubber outsole. The cushioning is responsive but not the best for impact protection. The shoe is a solid budget option.
5317,102,10,8.0,2023-04-13,expert_overall,The Li-Ning Wade Son of Flash has top-tier traction and low-to-the-ground cushioning. I felt quick and light on my feet when playing in this shoe.

5319,102,268,8.2,2023-08-24,user_overall,"Amazing shoe at the start, very nice traction and cushion, and the materials were breathable. The main problem was the durability, about a month of wearing the shoe and it has various holes and rips in it."

5329,102,1,8.0,2023-04-29,cushion,"Most of the foam is Cloud foam, but there are pods of Boom in the forefoot and under the heel. The cushioning is bouncy, and the shank is thick."

5338,102,23,10.0,2023-05-02,support,"The layering of the upper keeps your foot secure. The shoe is also stable, and the TPU pieces keep you contained."
5339,102,1,9.0,2023-04-29,support,The lightning design on the side of the shoe offers a ton of stability. The lacing system and materials also help with the lockdown.

Traction is upper ""S"" tier and the cushion is great if you're a lighter individual who loves court feel and a minimalist shoe.  While The materials may be a little cheap, they're very breathable/flexible and conform nice to the foot which help with the support aspect of the s"

The stop on clean court is insane and sometimes I need to wear the ankle brace to not roll my ankle because of the support in this shoes kinda bad for someone have a weak ankle like me. Overall, this shoes is really nice for me and all the curry line is the best line of shoes I've ever hoop in."

5399,105,7,9.4,2023-03-21,expert_overall,"You can't go wrong with the Nike LeBron NXXT Gen at this price point. The traction is top-tier, the Zoom units feel fantastic, and the support is outstanding."
5400,105,104,9.0,2023-04-16,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron NXXT Gen is an awesome basketball shoe. It's quick, responsive, and stable, and the fit is dead on."
5401,105,10,8.8,2023-04-13,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron NXXT Gen feels light, responsive, and quick. The traction performance is fantastic, and the cushioning does everything well."
5402,105,112,8.4,2023-03-12,expert_overall,I like the Nike LeBron NXXT Gen better than the LeBron 20. I recommend the shoe for all players. It performed better than expected because of the comfortable materials and tacky traction.
5403,105,3,8.4,2023-04-13,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron NXXT Gen is an A-tier shoe. The cushioning isn't as bouncy but stable, and the traction provides good stopping power."
5404,105,1,8.2,2023-02-08,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron NXXT Gen is a solid option for forwards who don't need maximalist cushioning setups. The cushioning is comfortable, and the materials play well."
5405,105,278,8.5,2024-02-17,user_overall,The Lebron nxxt gen is a sturdy performer but doesn’t fit my playstyle all that well. I would’ve liked more responsive and low to the ground cushioning and would’ve avoided all that forefoot cushion because for me it’s a bit much. On extremely dusty courts the traction is not good but on clean courts it’s incredible. Me personally I’m a bit disappointed with the Lebron nxxt gen as it just didn’t fit my personal playstyle as a point guard but I would definitely recommend it for heavier players
5406,105,214,8.6,2023-05-25,user_overall,"Even without the $40 price decrease, I thought the NXXT Gen outperformed the XX on court. They kept the great combo zoom setup, but made a few changes around it. The thick, soft cushlon was swapped out for a firmer phylon, greatly increasing courtfeel while still providing good impact protection. The bottom loaded CF shank was swapped out for a top loaded TPE shank, but still gives plenty of return and support. Traction is still great. They are lighter than the XX, and feel much quicker on foot."
5407,105,279,9.6,2024-04-15,user_overall,"The Lebron NXXT gen was easily one of the best basketball shoes in the many I've worn as a basketball player. I'm a shifty guard, who stops on a dime often and these shoes provided excellent traction to help out with that. The materials and cushioning were extremely durable. However, I did notice the front of the shoe started to peel off a little due to some rigorous use and a little slippage at the start. Other than that, the shoe was excellent and easily one of the best I've used."
5408,105,280,8.3,2024-03-22,user_overall,"When I first got this shoe I thought it was pretty good and just a solid basketball shoe that I can use to play. I play mainly outdoor cause there aren't many indoor places to hoop near me. I have flat feet so every time I play with them they always hurt my feet and I get a lot of pain. Im no expert on rating basketball shoes but i feel like the traction on these aren't the best, neither is the comfort. The only thing that I truly like about them specifically is the support."
5409,105,281,8.6,2023-04-18,user_overall,great shoe overall but its slightly narrow and the translucent outsole picks up a lot of dust. id also recommend going half a size up cause the shoe runs small. other than that the shoe does not really have any flaws. the materials are not as good as the lebron 20s but they get the job done. the traction is amazing and the zoom turbo units provide alot of bounce. id say this is definitely a better option than the lebron 20s because of the 40$ price difference.
5410,105,7,9.0,2023-03-21,traction,The traction performed amazingly well on clean and dirty courts.
5411,105,104,9.0,2023-04-16,traction,"The traction performance feels the same as the LeBron 20. It's just below the top tier, which is impressive."
5412,105,10,10.0,2023-04-13,traction,You don't have to worry about the traction on clean courts. The performance is top-tier. It's an easy wipe on dusty courts too.
5413,105,112,9.0,2023-03-12,traction,"The traction was beastly, even on dirty floors. These are just below elite but still top-tier."
5414,105,3,9.0,2023-04-13,traction,The traction is grippy and isn't affected by dust as long as you wipe.
5415,105,1,8.0,2023-02-08,traction,The traction is fluid and easy to get from one spot to the next. The downside is that it doesn't stop like the LeBron 20.

5418,105,10,9.0,2023-04-13,cushion,The cushioning offers a decent court feel without sacrificing impact protection. It does this while still being bouncy.
5419,105,112,8.0,2023-03-12,cushion,"The foam feels stiff to the touch, but underfoot the cushioning feels great. I prefer to feel bouncier, but it's still a solid performer."
5420,105,3,8.0,2023-04-13,cushion,"The heel impact protection is less plush but more stable. The shoe loses some bounciness to the LeBron 20 too. It's responsive, though."
5421,105,1,9.0,2023-02-08,cushion,"The foam feels like the Cushlon used in the LeBron 20s. The Zoom units are also the same, but the shank plate is plastic instead of carbon fibre. It's slightly less bouncy but just as comfortable."
5422,105,7,8.5,2023-03-21,materials,"The upper is screen mesh, and it feels like a downgrade. It's still durable, though."
5423,105,104,9.0,2023-04-16,materials,"The materials feel soft and comfortable. Despite the tight fit, I didn't experience any pain."

5426,105,3,8.0,2023-04-13,materials,The materials feel plasticky but are thin and soft.
5427,105,1,8.0,2023-02-08,materials,"The materials are engineered mesh. It's a combination of textile and TPU threads. It feels contained and is surprisingly strong. The tongue isn't as padded, though."
5428,105,7,10.0,2023-03-21,support,The support feels absolutely amazing. The materials contain you laterally. It feels like a straitjacket on feet.
5429,105,104,9.0,2023-04-16,support,Lockdown in the shoe feels perfect. The lateral stability is solid too.
5430,105,10,8.0,2023-04-13,support,"Torsional support isn't the best, but it didn't bother me. The lateral containment felt supportive."

5433,105,1,8.0,2023-02-08,support,The containment of the shoe is impressive because of the materials.
5434,105,7,10.0,2023-03-21,fit,"With the right size, there is no dead space. It's a 1-to-1 fit."

5438,105,3,8.0,2023-04-13,fit,"The length is short, and the fit overall is tight but comfortable."
5439,105,1,8.0,2023-02-08,fit,It accommodates different foot shapes well because the forefoot doesn't taper much.
5440,105,7,100.0,2023-03-21,outdoor,The durability of the rubber seems solid.
5441,105,10,0.0,2023-04-13,outdoor,The rubber is not the best for outdoors.

5459,106,149,9.1,2025-01-25,user_overall,"This shoe is incredible as it has phenomenal traction, the cushion was comfortable and the support is great. The only downsides of this shoe would be the weight as it is extremely heavy and the ventilation as there is no air flow. But overall this shoe would be a great shoe for forwards and bigs but really questionable for guards. This might be one of hardens best shoes yet"

The only disadvantages that it has is that it’s a little heavy( but you don’t feel it that much), the materials are not breathable and your feet get hot easily and that it picks up a little bit of dust(I play in a dirty court) . Overall it is really good and I really recommend it for strong forwards/wings ."

5473,106,23,9.0,2023-03-12,cushion,"I prefer full-length Boost, but I still enjoyed the forefoot Lightstrike. It's bouncy despite being thin. The combination of Boost in the back and Lightstrike in the front is a balanced cushioning setup."
5474,106,32,9.5,2023-03-21,cushion,"The Lightstrike in the forefeet provides an excellent court feel. It's thin, so it feels firm but bouncy. The Boost in the heel also offers plushness and impact protection."

5499,106,10,9.0,2023-02-16,support,Support and lockdown felt stable. My foot was not moving within the shoe because of the lateral containment.
5500,106,23,9.0,2023-03-12,fit,"The ankle sock collar of the shoe fits better than similar shoes, and you still get a supportive fit around the midfoot."
5501,106,32,9.0,2023-03-21,fit,The shoe fits a tad long. It doesn't affect performance.
5502,106,5,9.0,2023-08-18,fit,"The internal sleeve keeps you contained, and it feels form-fitting."

5562,108,10,9.0,2023-02-08,expert_overall,"The Jordan 37 Low is a responsive performance shoe with grippy traction and a bouncy cushion. The bounciness can be excessive, but the overall performance is solid."
5563,108,112,8.4,2023-01-22,expert_overall,"The Jordan 37 is a bouncy and explosive shoe. The Zoom units in the cushioning feel great, and the traction performs well on clean courts."
5564,108,3,8.4,2023-04-13,expert_overall,"The Jordan 37 Low is a better performer than the regular Jordan 37. The upgraded materials provide improved support and comfort, while the traction and cushioning are still impressive."
5565,108,100,8.2,2023-06-25,expert_overall,"The Jordan 37 Low addresses a lot of problems the regular 37 had. The support and fit feel much improved, while the traction and cushioning remain the same."
5566,108,1,8.0,2023-01-22,expert_overall,"The Jordan 37 is an excellent option for players who play on their forefoot often. The traction holds up, and the forefoot cushioning is explosive."
5567,108,20,8.0,2023-06-16,expert_overall,"The Air Jordan 37 Low feels like a downgrade. I'm a bit disappointed. Lateral containment is an issue, but cushioning is still impressive."
5568,108,214,8.6,2023-06-17,user_overall,"The Jordan 37 Low offers all of the best features from the Jordan 37, but in a nimble low top frame. The Amazing forefoot cushioning setup was carried over from the 37, and provided fantastic bounce. While I would l prefer the heel to be just a little softer, it doesn’t take anything away from the performance of the shoe. The support was a slight upgrade over the 37, or at the very least I felt that I could be a little more aggressive with my cuts. These shoes keep your feet feeling very fresh."
5569,108,286,9.6,2024-03-07,user_overall,Traction was top notch but it had slight dust pick up since the rubber is little too hard grows dont move with you if it was little more softer it would ve 10. Cushion was amazing it literally inceased my vertical and running jumping step backs ect. feel efortless. It was like a sock amazing lockdown and support was also really nice even tho materalls are kinda cheap but it does its  job some premium shoes don't have nice support but this did If you play in tiny socks your feet will hurt a lot

5576,108,100,9.0,2023-06-25,traction,The traction setup and performance of the 37 Low are the same as the regular 37.
5577,108,1,8.0,2023-01-22,traction,The traction pattern provides plenty of grip and acceleration. The rubber is better under the forefoot compared to the heel. The shoe performs much better in a straight line than on turns.
5578,108,20,7.0,2023-06-16,traction,The traction pattern is thick and flat. It also picks up dust quickly.
5579,108,10,10.0,2023-02-08,cushion,"The cushioning setup is too crazy for me. The forefoot features a double-stacked Zoom setup that provides tons of bounce. It can sometimes feel unstable, though."

5583,108,1,8.0,2023-01-22,cushion,"I love the combination of the double-stacked Zoom units with the bottom moulded shank. The Phylon and Formula 23 provide bounciness, but it isn't the best for shock absorption."
5584,108,20,10.0,2023-06-16,cushion,Cushioning is identical to the regular 37. Impact protection feels great.

5591,108,10,9.0,2023-02-08,support,Support and lockdown were super good. The lateral containment is reinforced. Your foot is not coming out of the footbed.

5593,108,3,8.0,2023-04-13,support,Stability and support are solid. The materials also help keep you contained laterally.

5595,108,1,8.0,2023-01-22,support,"I had zero heel slippage in the shoe, but the materials could be better for containment."
5596,108,20,7.0,2023-06-16,support,"Support is the most controversial feature of the shoe. The toe box lockdown feels better, but there's no lateral containment because of the footbed construction."
5597,108,10,8.0,2023-02-08,fit,I enjoyed the fit because I prefer my shoes to be snug.
5598,108,112,8.0,2023-01-22,fit,I have narrow feet and enjoyed the fit.

5600,108,100,8.0,2023-06-25,fit,The fit around the ankle is much better on the low. The tongue also doesn't move around much.
5601,108,1,8.0,2023-01-22,fit,I was pleasantly surprised with the fit. The shoe accommodates my foot quite nicely.
5602,108,20,8.0,2023-06-16,fit,"There's no dead space in the toe box, unlike the regular 37s. The shoe feels flexible and supportive around your foot."

5615,109,3,8.2,2023-07-11,expert_overall,"The Li-Ning JB1 is a solid shoe but is overpriced at retail. The cushioning is a top feature, but shifty players might want to double-check with the lateral containment."
5616,109,20,7.8,2023-07-11,expert_overall,"The Li-Ning Jimmy Butler 1 is only a decent performer on clean hardwood courts. The materials are the main disappointment, but the cushioning feels good."

5622,109,10,8.0,2023-07-11,traction,"The foam outsole bites on clean courts, but the stop isn't as hard as the Curry shoes, which is a pro for the JB1. The shoe picks up dust moderately quickly."

5624,109,20,7.0,2023-07-11,traction,"I never felt 100% confident in this traction. I had minor slippage. The rubber grips, but it doesn't bite."
5625,109,1,9.0,2023-07-11,cushion,"The drop-in midsole is contoured and moulds to your foot well. When combined with the shank plate, the Boom foam feels like a bouncy springboard."
5626,109,2,9.0,2023-07-11,cushion,Li-Ning uses a drop-in Boom midsole. The foam is thick and offers plenty of impact protection. It also feels bouncy.
5627,109,10,8.0,2023-07-11,cushion,"The forefoot feels springy, which I like. The Boom foam feels comfortable, but the sock liner of the drop-in midsole could be better."
5628,109,3,9.0,2023-07-11,cushion,The Boom drop-in midsole is responsive and supportive. I was genuinely surprised by the impact protection and compression.
5629,109,20,9.0,2023-07-11,cushion,The Boom drop-in midsole provides excellent impact protection and feels responsive.
5630,109,1,8.0,2023-07-11,materials,"The upper is entirely Boom fibre, which is a TPU mesh. The tongue is my favourite part of the shoe too. I love how padded it is."

5634,109,20,6.0,2023-07-11,materials,"The textile becomes more flexible after a break-in period. The materials are a mixed bag overall. The build quality is a disappointment, though."
5635,109,1,9.0,2023-07-11,support,The heel counter and TPU plate on the midpart of the shoe keep you contained very well.
5636,109,2,9.0,2023-07-11,support,"The support is fantastic. The forefoot is locked down, and the midfoot wing keeps you contained. The lace lock also secures your foot."

5664,110,1,10.0,2022-12-22,traction,My favourite part of the shoe is the outsole tread. It's aggressive herringbone that offers tons of grip and stability.
5665,110,23,9.0,2023-04-16,traction,The rubber is grippy enough to perform well indoors. I think traction is the best feature of the shoe.
5666,110,1,7.0,2022-12-22,cushion,The cushioning is my least favourite part of the shoe. It's EVA with forefoot Zoom Air. It'll be durable but doesn't have as much pop as I'd like.
5667,110,23,7.0,2023-04-16,cushion,"I don't love this cushioning setup because I prefer something plusher. The shoe is responsive, and you can feel the small Zoom unit in the forefoot."

5669,110,23,7.0,2023-04-16,materials,"The materials are the most disappointing and worst aspect of the shoe. They're flimsy and feel cheap, but they don't take away too much from the performance."

5671,110,23,7.5,2023-04-16,support,The support is good but not great. It feels stable on the court.

5682,111,294,8.5,2023-10-13,user_overall,"The best NB shoe I have tried so far, they are very light and still contain the foot very well despite going half a size up, the cushioning has not given me problems but it is better only for perimeter players, the traction grips very well and I loved the materials, they stick to your foot like a sock. If I have to criticize it, it is that it is very likely that the cushioning is not the best for performing many vertical jumps and it is not an option to use exclusively on outdoor courts."

5786,113,303,8.2,2023-04-07,user_overall,Overall a good shoe for its price. Traction is top tier. Materials are good though the toe box leather doesn’t feel great. Durability is amazing I use mine outdoor all the time. Cushion is good id recommend replacing the insoles though. I went true to size actually a bit longer of a shoe. Lockdown was good but not amazing I had heel slippage even after doing a runners lace style lacing. But overall it’s an amazing shoe for its price point
5787,113,224,8.8,2023-01-03,user_overall,"Yo this shoe is fucking amazing, for real traction is insane, it grips on outdoors, cushion is really responsive with good court feel but still have a little bit of compression, the lateral support is really good, the fit is really comfortable, the materials are kinda cheap but performance wise they make their job, you can definitely play with them outdoors, the durability should be good (not amazing tho), great shoe for any type of guards."

5824,114,2,8.0,2023-08-01,cushion,The bounceback from the torsion plate and the foam cushioning improve after an initial break-in period. It's low and responsive too.

5854,115,2,8.0,2023-08-01,cushion,"The foam needs time to break in. It's denser than previous models, making it more stable."
5855,115,1,7.0,2023-08-01,cushion,"The foam feels plush but firm. It feels bottom-heavy, but there is some bounce."
5856,115,2,8.0,2023-08-01,materials,The upper feels like a ripstop material. It's incredibly supportive and durable.
5857,115,1,8.0,2023-08-01,materials,The weaving of the materials is dense and solid. The shoe is set up to anchor your foot in.
5858,115,2,9.0,2023-08-01,support,A unique cage around the back of the shoe adds support and stability. The shoe is catered towards keeping players stable.
5859,115,1,9.0,2023-08-01,support,"Most of the shoe's features keep you contained, locked down, and anchored into the shoe."
5860,115,2,8.0,2023-08-01,fit,The fit is supportive and contained.
5861,115,1,8.0,2023-08-01,fit,"The width of the shoe is comfortable, but the length is a bit roomy. Overall, the fit is incredibly accommodating."
5862,115,2,50.0,2023-08-01,outdoor,"The rubber is thick, so it's safe for outdoor use."
5863,115,1,50.0,2023-08-01,outdoor,"The outdoor performance isn't bad, but these shoes are a lot better for indoors."
5864,115,1,4,2023-08-01,size,"People with narrow feet can go down a full size, and people with medium feet can go down half size."
5865,116,32,9.5,2022-11-11,expert_overall,"If you're a fan of the Curry 8 and 9, you'll enjoy the Curry 10. The traction is phenomenal, the cushioning is solid, and the support and lockdown have no issues."
5866,116,104,9.2,2023-04-16,expert_overall,"The Curry 10 is one of my favourite shoes of the year. The shoe feels like an extension of your foot. The traction is phenomenal, the fit is on point, and the shoe is supportive."
5867,116,293,9.0,2022-11-11,expert_overall,"The Curry 10 has tremendous traction, responsive cushioning, and comfortable materials. I prefer the Curry 10 compared to the 8 and 9."
5868,116,1,8.8,2022-11-02,expert_overall,"The Curry 10 has enough upgrades to offer an improved performance experience compared to the Curry 9. The cushioning has more spring, and the traction continues to be amazing."
5869,116,112,8.8,2022-11-07,expert_overall,"The Curry 10 feels similar to the Curry 8 and the 9, but there is a slight upgrade. The materials feel better while the traction remains the best available traction."
5870,116,307,8.8,2022-11-20,expert_overall,"The Curry 10 is one of the best basketball shoes available. The traction and cushioning are good for shifty players, and the support is not an issue."
5871,116,7,8.8,2023-02-08,expert_overall,"The Curry 10 is one of the best performance basketball shoes. The traction and support are top-notch, and the materials feel good, too."
5872,116,20,7.4,2023-04-26,expert_overall,"If you play on clean courts and have ankle braces, the Curry 10 is meant for you. I experienced slipping with dust, and the cushioning wasn't enough for my play style."
5873,116,68,8.6,2023-12-27,user_overall,"Muito bom, o tênis é extremamente leve e confortável, porém não perde amortecimento! não posso dizer que é o melhor no amortecimento mas eu realmente gostei, principalmente comparado ao peso, solado com certeza não serve pra outdoor, usado em quadras abertas certamente vai desgastar demais, se molda muito bem ao pé, amarração ótima e respirável, a tração em quadras limpas é expecional, mas acumula sujeira e então se a quadra não estiver limpa, vai escorregar… mas ótima opção pra atletas rápidos!"
5874,116,308,7.9,2022-11-19,user_overall,Phenomenal traction. The traction is so good that it sometimes hurt my feet especially m
5875,116,309,9.1,2023-03-15,user_overall,"Speed, traction, and reliability are all present in the curry 10's. I LOVE the traction and its stop-on-a-dime tackiness. The curry's are lightweight and really feel like a comfy running shoes. The only drawback is that the traction is so good that the shoe will completely stop when trying to slow down from a full sprint. The shoe has a nice curve in the forefoot that makes jump shots feel extra flowy. Another key benefit of this shoe is the boost that it gives for jumping."
5876,116,310,8.8,2023-10-29,user_overall,"Cushioning and traction is up to my expectation. Flow is quite comfortable after some breaking in time and traction is solid even on outdoor court, although does pick up dust quite often. Material is very nice and flexible, the traction pattern holds up outstandingly well even in outdoor courts after roughly 5 months of play time. A slight heel slippage could be felt but does not affect the performance much. Overall pretty good for the price."
5877,116,264,9.0,2023-04-04,user_overall,"The curry ten is phenomenal. It has amazing traction, so much that it hurts me indoors. Outdoors it was fine, it held up ok, but just use it once in a while, or else the foam is going to get destroyed. It has a nice fit, and you don’t need to break it in but your feet might hurt a slight bit during your first session in these. I recommend these for people who want to be speedy, because they are extremely light and are shifty."
5878,116,32,10.0,2022-11-11,traction,"The traction is incredibly grippy. It feels like glue when you plant your feet. I had some inconsistencies with dusty courts, though."
5879,116,104,10.0,2023-04-16,traction,"The best attribute of the shoe is the Flow foam. The traction is incredibly grippy. It's GOAT-level on clean courts, and it handles dust with ease."
5880,116,293,10.0,2022-11-11,traction,The Flow outsole is a hard-stopping traction pattern. It's some of the best available.
5881,116,1,10.0,2022-11-02,traction,"The outsole is still Flow, but the shoe's tread patterns are chunkier in this year's model. There's also a concavity to the outsole, which acts like a suction cup."
5882,116,112,10.0,2022-11-07,traction,This traction is the best of all time.
5883,116,307,10.0,2022-11-20,traction,The traction on this shoe is crazy. It's top-of-the-line.
5884,116,7,9.5,2023-02-08,traction,"The traction performs outstandingly on clean courts. You have to wipe on dirty courts, but the performance is still top-tier."
5885,116,20,7.0,2023-04-26,traction,I played on a synthetic rubber court and experienced a lot of sliding. I slipped on dusty hardwood too. The only time I didn't slide was on a clean hardwood court.
5886,116,32,9.0,2022-11-11,cushion,The Flow cushioning is light and bouncy. It also provides a solid court feel with decent bounce-back energy return.
5887,116,104,8.0,2023-04-16,cushion,"The Flow foam is a smooth, well-balanced setup that works well for me. It's not plush, but it's comfortable."
5888,116,293,8.0,2022-11-11,cushion,"The full-length Flow midsole is responsive and low to the ground. It doesn't have much impact protection, though."
5889,116,1,9.0,2022-11-02,cushion,"The shank inside the Flow foam is longer in the 10. The cushioning still offers plenty of comfort, bend, and elasticity."
5890,116,112,8.0,2022-11-07,cushion,"The cushioning is the same as the last few Curry models. It uses Flow foam, and it feels the same. There's no impact protection, but it's one of the best shoes for court feel."
5891,116,307,8.0,2022-11-20,cushion,This is one of the best shoes you can have as a jump shooter because of the cushioning.
5892,116,7,7.5,2023-02-08,cushion,"There is a bit of impact protection, but it isn't the most responsive setup in the heel. The cushioning offers a strong court feel, though."
5893,116,20,8.0,2023-04-26,cushion,"The Flow foam is responsive, but the forefoot is too thin for dunkers like me. The court feel is excellent for point guards."
5894,116,32,8.0,2022-11-11,materials,The materials are breathable and lightweight.
5895,116,104,9.0,2023-04-16,materials,"Under Armour uses Warp again, but it's refined this time around. It's supportive while remaining flexible."
5896,116,293,9.0,2022-11-11,materials,"The Warp upper feels identical to the previous model. It's thin, supportive, and comfortable."
5897,116,1,8.0,2022-11-02,materials,"The Warp threads are flatter this year, but it has the same properties. I also like the wider tongue opening on this shoe."
5898,116,112,8.0,2022-11-07,materials,The shoe is lightweight. The heel padding and comfort feel soft too. The upper feels similar to the Curry 9 but is a slight improvement.
5899,116,307,8.0,2022-11-20,materials,The materials are lightweight and breathable.
5900,116,7,8.5,2023-02-08,materials,I enjoyed the material setup. The shoe is breathable and supportive.
5901,116,20,7.0,2023-04-26,materials,The plastic ankle support materials banged against my ankle bones. There are no problems with breathability. I expect more for a superstar like Steph.
5902,116,32,9.0,2022-11-11,support,The stability is perfect for players that make shifty movements.
5903,116,104,9.0,2023-04-16,support,The materials and fit of the shoe help keep the support locked down.
5904,116,293,9.0,2022-11-11,support,"I had zero issues with support and lockdown. The upper materials, midsole, and heel counter work well to lock you down and keep you contained."
5905,116,1,9.0,2022-11-02,support,I really enjoyed the improvement of the heel stability in this shoe. The materials also do a solid job of keeping your foot contained.
5906,116,112,10.0,2022-11-07,support,The support and lockdown on the Curry 10 are phenomenal.
5907,116,307,9.0,2022-11-20,support,"The ankle support is solid, and I had no issues with stability."
5908,116,7,9.5,2023-02-08,support,"Ankle support is locked down, and the heel counter feels secure. I had no issues with lateral containment, either."
5909,116,20,7.0,2023-04-26,support,"There are no supportive elements for lateral containment. There's some dead space in the toe box too, which causes some sliding on the footbed. The heel lockdown is solid, though."
5910,116,32,9.0,2022-11-11,fit,"After some breaking in, the shoe accommodates your feet nicely. It starts out snug, though."
5911,116,104,10.0,2023-04-16,fit,My foot stayed locked down as soon as I put on the shoe.
5912,116,293,9.0,2022-11-11,fit,The shoe fits me perfectly. It feels like a glove.
5913,116,1,8.0,2022-11-02,fit,"The fit change is subtle, but it is different. The shoe has more room in the forefoot."
5914,116,112,8.0,2022-11-07,fit,The fit was solid for me. It should accommodate most foot shapes.
5915,116,307,9.0,2022-11-20,fit,The fit of the shoe is comfortable.
5916,116,7,9.0,2023-02-08,fit,"I felt a 1:1 fit, and I love how secure it feels."
5917,116,20,8.0,2023-04-26,fit,I had no issues with how the shoe fit.
5918,116,293,50.0,2022-11-11,outdoor,"The durability is decent, but I wouldn't take them outdoors."
5919,116,1,0.0,2022-11-02,outdoor,Flow foam does not hold up on outdoor courts.
5920,116,307,0.0,2022-11-20,outdoor,I wouldn't consider this an outdoor shoe.
5921,116,7,0.0,2023-02-08,outdoor,I don't think this outsole is durable enough to take outdoors.
5922,116,20,0.0,2023-04-26,outdoor,Don't take these shoes outdoors.
5923,116,293,3,2022-11-11,width,"If you have a wide foot or want a roomier fit, go up half a size."
5924,116,1,2,2022-11-02,width,Go up half a size if you have a 2E foot.
5925,116,112,3,2022-11-07,width,"The sneaker looks narrow, but it gets wide. It accommodates width decently."
5926,116,307,2,2022-11-20,width,Go half a size up if you have wider feet.
5927,116,7,3,2023-02-08,width,The fit is slightly wide. I would still go up half a size if you have wider feet.
5928,116,20,3,2023-04-26,width,The shoe is not a problem for wide-footers.
5929,116,293,3,2022-11-11,size,I went true to size.
5930,116,1,3,2022-11-02,size,Go true to size if you have a narrow or medium foot.
5931,116,112,3,2022-11-07,size,I went true to size.
5932,116,307,3,2022-11-20,size,I went half a size up because of my wide foot.
5933,116,7,3,2023-02-08,size,The shoe fits true to size.
5934,116,20,3,2023-04-26,size,The Curry 10 runs perfectly true to size.
5935,117,1,8.4,2023-01-10,expert_overall,"The Adidas D.O.N. Issue #4 is a well-built shoe for containment, lockdown, and traction. It's a comfortable shoe overall but beware of the foam bottoming out."
5936,117,100,8.0,2022-11-03,expert_overall,"If you want stability, then Adidas D.O.N Issue #4 is for you. The shoe has all the support features a performance shoe needs, and the traction performs well on clean courts."
5937,117,293,8.0,2022-11-03,expert_overall,"The Adidas D.O.N Issue #4 is a responsive shoe that performs best on clean courts. It's a pretty good performer, but it's a tad bulky for my liking."
5938,117,20,7.0,2023-04-16,expert_overall,"I wouldn't recommend the Adidas D.O.N. Issue #4. At best, it's alright for shootarounds and practice. The traction is too inconsistent, and the cushioning is stiff."
5939,117,214,7.6,2023-05-25,user_overall,"The D.O.N. Issue 4 is a cool looking shoe that keeps the foot well contained and stable while providing a responsive ride. Where the shoe falls short is fit and comfort. My pain point is the support plate that runs up both sides and underneath near the middle of the shoe. The shoe is quite narrow in that area, and that plate digs into the arch of my foot on the lateral side. The shoe is already a bit long, and doesn’t have great heel containment. This meant going up half a size was not an option"
5940,117,311,9.2,2022-11-20,user_overall,"Naaaah I need to end this. I saw a lot of bad reviews on these and I ONLY SEE HATE. Like I am not capping when giving this review trust me. Traction is very good clean or dusty court. I never slipped and the court I have practices on is hella dusty. Cushion is actually nice and responsive with a lil give to it. Fit, Lockdown and materials all very good. Durability is also god tier imo. I have these longer than my harden vol 6 and the hardens are fried and these are INTACT. Just cop now and see"
5941,117,312,7.0,2023-06-15,user_overall,"donovan must’ve partnered with swifter with these shoes cause they attract dust like no shoe i’ve owned before. I wipe my feet every time up and down the floor. I can’t make a quick cut cause my feet can’t catch on the ground. It feels like i’m running out there in just socks.  I’ve only had these shoes for a few months but the paint and color is already chipping off parts of the shoes too. But for fit wise and cushion it’s fine, I like how it’s not too narrow around my feet."
5942,117,198,8.9,2024-04-08,user_overall,This shoe
5943,117,313,8.4,2023-01-28,user_overall,This shoes was a good option for me the price was great and the support was great it helped me alot in fast and quick moves. The cushioning was good but when dunking the cushion doesn't really absorb all the pressure when falling. The traction in clean court is incredible and squeaky but in outdoor the grip is good but not that great there's a low chance that you will slip on the ground. The fit is really great it holds on the foot it manages to stop the ankle from spraining it.
5944,117,1,9.0,2023-01-10,traction,The traction has a decent grip and offers a speedy playstyle.
5945,117,100,8.0,2022-11-03,traction,"Overall, the traction performance is good indoors and outdoors. Dusty courts do give the traction some issues, though."
5946,117,293,8.0,2022-11-03,traction,The traction performs best on clean courts after an initial break-in period. Dust causes problems in performance.
5947,117,20,7.0,2023-04-16,traction,"The traction is okay on clean courts, but dust causes you to slip and slide."
5948,117,1,8.0,2023-01-10,cushion,The cushioning is entirely Lightstrike. It offers a light feeling underfoot.
5949,117,100,7.0,2022-11-03,cushion,The Lightstrike cushioning is my least favourite part of the shoe. The comfort level of the foam is average.
5950,117,293,8.0,2022-11-03,cushion,"The full-length Lightstrike feels comfortable and soft, but it bottoms out quicker than other foams."
5951,117,20,7.0,2023-04-16,cushion,"I needed to break the cushioning in. The Lightstrike is stiff, and the impact protection could be better. The court feel isn't there, either."
5952,117,1,9.0,2023-01-10,materials,Other brands should try to emulate the uppers of this shoe. It offers solid lockdown while remaining lightweight and breathable.
5953,117,100,8.0,2022-11-03,materials,"The upper is a nice-feeling jacquard material, but the breathability is not the best. It's comfortable, but not for sessions that run too long."
5954,117,293,8.0,2022-11-03,materials,The materials Adidas is calling Lightlock are thin and supportive without sacrificing comfort.
5955,117,20,7.0,2023-04-16,materials,"The upper needs some break-in time. The materials aren't breathable, and the quality feels cheap too."
5956,117,1,8.0,2023-01-10,support,"The containment is customizable with the lacing system, and the uppers keep you contained well."
5957,117,100,9.0,2022-11-03,support,"The support is one of the stronger aspects of the shoe. The shank plate prevents the shoe from twisting and folding too much, while the extra eyelets allow for additional customizability."
5958,117,293,8.0,2022-11-03,support,The shank plate provides good torsional support. I also felt supported laterally.
5959,117,20,7.0,2023-04-16,support,"The overall lockdown is decent. The heel cup is solid, and the stability is solid. The poor traction negatively affects the support, though."
5960,117,1,8.0,2023-01-10,fit,The fit of the shoe is generous.
5961,117,100,8.0,2022-11-03,fit,"The lacing system provides a locked-down, secure feeling, but the midfoot section is moderately snug."
5962,117,293,8.0,2022-11-03,fit,My shoe fits pretty damn well.
5963,117,20,7.0,2023-04-16,fit,My fit felt alright but not perfect because of my high arch. The tongue and lacing system help with customizing the fit.
5964,117,1,50.0,2023-01-10,outdoor,The shoe might not last long outdoors.
5965,117,293,50.0,2022-11-03,outdoor,"The rubber is hard, and the grooves are thick enough for outdoor play."
5966,117,293,2,2022-11-03,width,It is slightly narrow.
5967,117,20,4,2023-04-16,width,There will be dead space in the toe box of the shoe if you have narrow feet.
5968,117,293,3,2022-11-03,size,I went true to size with no issues.
5969,117,20,5,2023-04-16,size,The shoe runs a full-size large.
5970,118,1,8.4,2022-11-12,expert_overall,"The Adidas Trae Young 2 is a flexible shoe that's best for players who enjoy having more freedom of movement. It's a niche profile, but I enjoyed playing in the shoe."
5971,118,20,8.2,2023-04-13,expert_overall,"The Adidas Trae Young 2 is not as good as the previous model, but it's still a solid performer. The materials are improved, and the cushioning performed better than expected."
5972,118,293,8.0,2022-11-23,expert_overall,"The Adidas Trae Young 2 struggles with performance on dusty courts, but I enjoyed the cushioning and support features of the shoe."
5973,118,112,7.6,2022-11-11,expert_overall,"I did not enjoy the Adidas Trae Young 2 as much as I was hoping. The cushioning feels fantastic, but the traction and materials weren't up to par."
5974,118,314,9.6,2023-03-14,user_overall,"Honestly I love this shoe. Traction is solid on clean courts, but it does pick up dust. The cushioning is amazing and gives you a lot of freedom of movement. For me personally the shoe fit fine, and in terms of getting into the shoe. After the 7-10 time it became much easier. I personally think it performs well outdoors, but is definitely made for a clean indoor hard-wood floor. Despite the weight it's not court heavy, and the lockdown is solid. I think if your a quick guard its perfect."
5975,118,315,8.2,2023-11-01,user_overall,"This shoe would be good for bigger guards, and forwards. The boost in the heel and light strike in the forefoot feels amazing. My only complaint is the fit, my heel feels like it’s gonna pop out, and when I stop fast, my toes smash into the front of the shoe. I would go a half size up. I also am not a fan of the lack of padding and laces. The laces are only in the forefoot, and there is not padding in the tongue. The traction needs break in time but it is also top tier."
5976,118,316,9.0,2022-12-28,user_overall,"Other than the fact that its hard to put on and the laces dont do anything, its overall a solid shoe. I can say that the traction is alright, cushioning is great, fit is fine (not considering the very small ankle collar) comfort is good, impact protection is good, breathability is meh, and the weight is heavier than average. Overall im happy with this shoe and can recommend for people that are good with the things I just stated."
5977,118,15,8.2,2023-01-30,user_overall,"Not bad tbh.Its more according to your self if you like it or not.First of all the traction picks alot, I repeat it picks alot of dust.Cusion pretty similar to the Trae 1.For support it's hard to put on but ones your feet got in the support is great but the laces doesn't do anything.And Materials is uncomfortable at first but you will get used to it."
5978,118,215,9.2,2023-06-05,user_overall,"I like the shoe the traction has nice bite especially on lateral movements, the heel cushion is amazing the only down I have for this shoe is the lightstrike in the forefoot has little cushion and doesn’t feel bouncy"
5979,118,1,9.0,2022-11-12,traction,The outsole tread is my favourite part of the shoe. The traction grabs in a lot of directions.
5980,118,20,8.0,2023-04-13,traction,The traction has a good grip and bites on clean courts. You have to wipe on dusty courts to maintain performance.
5981,118,293,7.0,2022-11-23,traction,"The traction starts poorly, but it performs well on clean courts. Dust pickup is also a problem."
5982,118,112,7.0,2022-11-11,traction,"The traction was inconsistent for me. On clean courts, it's solid. With dust, it becomes tricky."
5983,118,1,8.0,2022-11-12,cushion,"The shoe still uses a Lightstrike forefoot and Boost in the heel, but the shank setup makes the shoe more bouncy this year."
5984,118,20,9.0,2023-04-13,cushion,The impact protection is excellent. The Boost and Lightstrike feel better than expected.
5985,118,293,9.0,2022-11-23,cushion,The Boost cushioning in the heel is soft and provides a lot of impact protection. The Lightstrike in the forefoot also has a bit of bounce. The cushioning is one of my favourite parts of the shoe.
5986,118,112,9.0,2022-11-11,cushion,"I love the cushioning. The Boost in the heel is fantastic for impact protection, and the Lightstrike is soft."
5987,118,1,8.0,2022-11-12,materials,The materials are flexible and breathable.
5988,118,20,9.0,2023-04-13,materials,"The upper is Primeknit with a reinforced layer underneath for stability. It's not too breathable. The shoe is well-built overall, and the materials feel premium."
5989,118,293,8.0,2022-11-23,materials,Adidas uses what they call a Sock 360 knit for the materials. It feels soft and comfortable after a break-in period.
5990,118,112,7.0,2022-11-11,materials,"The materials are comfortable, but I don't enjoy how the laces feel. I'm not a fan."
5991,118,1,9.0,2022-11-12,support,Your rearfoot and midfoot lock into the shoe well because of how the shoe is made.
5992,118,20,8.0,2023-04-13,support,"The forefoot lockdown is decent, but the heel lockdown had issues. The shoe comes off if anything catches the back of your shoe. The stability is solid because of the torsion plate."
5993,118,293,8.0,2022-11-23,support,I was good to go with lateral containment and stability.
5994,118,112,8.0,2022-11-11,support,"I had no issues with heel lockdown, and the support was better than expected."
5995,118,1,8.0,2022-11-12,fit,"It's hard to put your foot into the shoe, but the forefoot accommodates most foot shapes."
5996,118,20,7.0,2023-04-13,fit,The shoes are hard to put on if you have high arches. The shoe starts uncomfortable but breaks in nicely.
5997,118,293,8.0,2022-11-23,fit,"The shoe fits me very well. It's a snug fit in the toe box, and the length was almost perfect. My only complaint is the shoe is difficult to put on."
5998,118,112,7.0,2022-11-11,fit,"The shoe is hard to put on, and I don't enjoy how the shoe fits on top of my foot."

6000,118,293,0.0,2022-11-23,outdoor,Some of the rubber on the outsole is too soft for outdoor play.

6002,118,293,3,2022-11-23,width,The shoe is regular width.

6007,119,1,8.4,2022-11-03,expert_overall,The Nike Air Deldon is one of the most creative shoes on the market. It allows you to move in different directions and offers a lot of range of motion for your footwork.
6008,119,293,7.6,2022-11-11,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Deldon is a decent performance shoe, but I don't enjoy playing in it because of the poor traction. I enjoyed the cushioning and support, though."
6009,119,112,7.0,2022-11-03,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Deldon has a fantastic design, but the traction and cushioning were disappointing. I can't recommend this shoe for performance."
6010,119,317,9.0,2023-09-17,user_overall,"Honestly, these might be the best basketball shoes I have ever owned. The cushion is AMAZING, step in comfort was insane and every time I put them on it feels incredible. The traction has been pretty good, I saw reviews saying it wouldn't perform well, but it has been really good playing outdoors and the rubber seems very hard, so I think they can last a while. The fit is good, but nothing amazing. However, the shoe is very easy to get in and out of and it looks amazing! No regrets!!"

6014,119,293,6.0,2022-11-11,traction,The traction performs poorly whenever there's dust. It performed alright if the court was freshly maintained.
6015,119,112,5.0,2022-11-03,traction,The traction performance was awful for me. I slipped a lot.
6016,119,1,9.0,2022-11-03,cushion,I love the full-length Air Strobel cushioning. It feels really plush underfoot.
6017,119,293,9.0,2022-11-11,cushion,"The foam is soft, and I love the full-length Air Strobel unit. There's some bounce provided from the forefoot Zoom unit too."
6018,119,112,6.0,2022-11-03,cushion,The cushioning disappointed me. I couldn't feel the full-length Air Strobel.
6019,119,1,9.0,2022-11-03,materials,The upper might be one of my favourites of the year. It feels plush and comfortable.
6020,119,293,7.0,2022-11-11,materials,This shoe uses some of the worst quality materials I've ever felt. It feels cheap but still manages to provide comfort.
6021,119,112,7.0,2022-11-03,materials,"The heel comfort and padding are one of the best I've felt. The rest of the upper is thin but not the most breathable. Overall, the quality is not good."
6022,119,1,8.0,2022-11-03,support,"There is no internal heel counter, so keep that in mind. The forefoot is secure, but the rear foot isn't the stablest."
6023,119,293,8.0,2022-11-11,support,The support and lockdown performed really well despite the lack of a true heel counter. I had no issues with lateral and ankle stability.
6024,119,112,9.0,2022-11-03,support,"I wish the shoe had a dedicated heel counter, but my heel still felt locked down. I didn't have any issues with the rest of the support and lockdown."
6025,119,1,9.0,2022-11-03,fit,"I was pleasantly surprised with the fit of the shoe. The forefoot accommodates width well, the upper holds your foot snugly, and it's comfortable."

6027,119,112,8.0,2022-11-03,fit,The fit feels great on foot.
6028,119,1,0.0,2022-11-03,outdoor,The tread is thin. I don't recommend taking these shoes outdoors.

6034,120,293,8.8,2022-11-15,expert_overall,"The Puma MB.02 is a quick, fast shoe with fantastic traction and adequate cushioning. The support also holds up well because of the materials."
6035,120,2,8.4,2022-11-23,expert_overall,"Overall, the Puma MB.02 is an improvement in LaMelo's shoe line. It has improved traction and materials while the support and cushioning remain solid."
6036,120,1,8.2,2022-11-07,expert_overall,"The Puma MB.02 is a solid shoe that's best for players who rely on impact protection to help with heavy footwork. The cushioning is stable and protective, and the traction grips well."
6037,120,7,8.2,2022-11-12,expert_overall,The Puma MB.02 is one of the best basketball shoes for support. It also has solid cushioning and reliable traction.
6038,120,5,8.2,2023-08-18,expert_overall,The Puma MB.02 has a lot of standard but proven features. It provides a lot of bang for your buck with soft cushioning and solid traction.
6039,120,104,8.0,2023-04-16,expert_overall,"Playing in the Puma MB.02 is a mixed bag for me. I like the traction and fit, but I don't like the stiff midsole."
6040,120,19,7.6,2022-12-04,expert_overall,"I was not impressed with the Puma MB.02 compared to the MB.01. The traction is solid, but most other features were better on the previous model."
6041,120,20,7.2,2023-07-07,expert_overall,"The Puma MB.02 takes a step back compared to the previous model. The traction is solid, but the cushioning and support are lacking."

6043,120,310,8.6,2023-10-29,user_overall,"One of my favourite hoops shoe. The cushioning is absolutely incredible, super comfortable right out the box with not much need to break in. Traction is phenomenol, grips the floor well but does pick up dust. Material feels nice and decently durable. I've been playing in these on outdoor court for a year now and haven't lost much if any traction pattern. Only con I see is the heel slippage but lacing it tightly usually reduces it. In general, It is an amazing performer, especially for the price."
6044,120,308,9.6,2022-11-19,user_overall,"Idk why, but this Shoe feels super lightweight. At first, it looks super heavy but feels the complet"
6045,120,83,7.8,2023-07-11,user_overall,"The MB.02 is a great shoe overall but has some issues with it like the traction, materials etc. The materials feel cheap as after a while the shoe starts break a bit in the ankle area and the front of the toe. The traction is amazing on clean courts and has a nice bite, but a dusty court is this shoes enemy, when wearing the shoe on a dusty court i have to wipe a lot! The support was alright i have rolled my ankle in these shoes 2-3 times 1 of those times during a tryout."
6046,120,320,8.1,2023-04-30,user_overall,"Step down from its predecessor, but still a solid, all around silhouette. Nothing too bad, but also nothing special. Disruptive upper pinches your foot and creases fast, traction is good, but grooves are softer and shallower (less durable), DONT USE OUTDOORS. Fully exposed Nitro is stiffer and higher off the ground, but still okay. Especially when on sale, and with many good colorways this shoe is certainly one to have in your rotation."
6047,120,307,10.0,2022-11-07,traction,The traction had a hard bite when I played on dusty courts. I had no sliding issues.
6048,120,293,10.0,2022-11-15,traction,The traction performs extremely well. I stopped on a dime regularly.
6049,120,2,9.0,2022-11-23,traction,"I love the traction of the MB.02. The rubber is pliable and stretchy, and the pattern grips hard."
6050,120,1,9.0,2022-11-07,traction,The traction holds up phenomenally indoors from a durability perspective. The shoe performs best on hardwood courts.
6051,120,7,8.5,2022-11-12,traction,"The traction pattern is thin, so the shoe needs a lot of wiping to handle dust. Despite the dust, it performs well."
6052,120,5,8.0,2023-08-18,traction,The traction was solid. I didn't slip when playing.
6053,120,104,9.0,2023-04-16,traction,The traction is my favourite aspect of the shoe. It works well indoors. Make sure to wipe on dusty courts. The rubber compound is sticky and grippy.
6054,120,19,8.0,2022-12-04,traction,"The traction performed well, but not as well as the MB.01."
6055,120,20,8.0,2023-07-07,traction,"The traction is solid. It performs on all courts, but dust picks up quickly."
6056,120,307,9.0,2022-11-07,cushion,"I felt some bounce, but the impact protection was solid."
6057,120,293,8.0,2022-11-15,cushion,"The Nitro foam feels comfortable and offers solid impact protection. It isn't the best cushioning for bounce, though."
6058,120,2,8.0,2022-11-23,cushion,"The cushioning needs a lot of break-in time. The Nitro foam eventually becomes comfortable for impact protection with some bounce in the forefoot, though."
6059,120,1,8.0,2022-11-07,cushion,"Puma puts Nitro foam in the heel and forefoot in the MB.02. The rest of the cushioning is a compression-moulded EVA. It feels dense, but it provides impact protection."
6060,120,7,8.0,2022-11-12,cushion,The cushioning feels like an upgrade to the MB.01. It offers a lot of impact protection and some bounce.
6061,120,5,8.0,2023-08-18,cushion,Heavier players will enjoy the Nitro foam more than lighter players. There's more cushioning and less court feel compared to the first model.
6062,120,104,7.0,2023-04-16,cushion,The carrier foam is thick and dense. I didn't feel the softer Nitro foam as much as I'd like.
6063,120,19,7.0,2022-12-04,cushion,"You can feel the difference in foams underfoot. It feels soft and is better for impact protection than energy return. The encasing rubber feels dense and clunky, though. It's not to my liking."
6064,120,20,7.0,2023-07-07,cushion,The Nitro foam doesn't get the job done. There's not enough impact protection in the heel.
6065,120,307,8.0,2022-11-07,materials,"The materials are breathable, so I didn't experience much sweat."
6066,120,293,8.0,2022-11-15,materials,"The materials are thin and durable, but it doesn't offer a premium feel."
6067,120,2,8.0,2022-11-23,materials,The MB.02 includes more screen mesh material than the MB.01. There are also additional plastic materials for extra support. It's also thin and well-ventilated.
6068,120,1,8.0,2022-11-07,materials,The upper is similar to the MB.01. It feels like a chainlink TPU mesh.
6069,120,7,7.0,2022-11-12,materials,"The materials aren't as thick on the MB.02, which makes the shoe easier to break in. Breathability could be better."
6070,120,5,8.0,2023-08-18,materials,"The mesh upper feels standard. It didn't wow me, but it performed as expected."
6071,120,104,8.0,2023-04-16,materials,"The materials are engineered mesh and fuse. I don't enjoy the implementation, but it's durable and breathable."
6072,120,19,7.0,2022-12-04,materials,"The upper feels stiffer than the previous model, even after breaking the shoe in."
6073,120,20,7.0,2023-07-07,materials,"Breathability is non-existent, and the materials feel basic."
6074,120,307,10.0,2022-11-07,support,The stability was excellent. I had no issues with ankle support.
6075,120,293,9.0,2022-11-15,support,I had zero issues with support and lockdown. The materials and heel counter keeps you contained laterally.
6076,120,2,9.0,2022-11-23,support,The upper does a solid job of providing lateral support. Heel containment and lockdown are also top-notch.
6077,120,1,8.0,2022-11-07,support,"The rubber compound under the midfoot is harder than the rest, which offers additional torsional stability."
6078,120,7,9.0,2022-11-12,support,"This shoe is extremely supportive. The fuse overlay keeps you contained, and the laces lock you into the shoe. It's the second-best basketball shoe for support."
6079,120,5,9.0,2023-08-18,support,Containment and lockdown are solid. I like the mid-cut design. I also like how contained the heel counter keeps my ankle.
6080,120,104,8.0,2023-04-16,support,"I had no containment issues, and I felt locked in. The support is solid."
6081,120,19,8.0,2022-12-04,support,"The shoe supports your foot well, but the stiffness isn't too comfortable."
6082,120,20,7.0,2023-07-07,support,The shoe lacks lateral stability and support. There's still no outrigger too.
6083,120,307,10.0,2022-11-07,fit,"The fit was easy to figure out, and I didn't need to adjust anything."
6084,120,293,9.0,2022-11-15,fit,The shoe fits me well. It feels identical to the MB.01.
6085,120,2,8.0,2022-11-23,fit,The shoe fits nicely around my foot.
6086,120,1,8.0,2022-11-07,fit,The upper makes you feel like you're really being held tightly. It fits well for most players.
6087,120,7,8.5,2022-11-12,fit,"The length is almost perfect, and the laces lock you down once you dial them in."
6088,120,5,8.0,2023-08-18,fit,The shoe is form-fitting.
6089,120,104,8.0,2023-04-16,fit,"The fit feels slightly narrow, but it didn't affect performance. The fit does its job."
6090,120,19,8.0,2022-12-04,fit,I had to go down half a size to get the snug fit I like
6091,120,20,7.0,2023-07-07,fit,The upper feels stiff and isn't flexible. There's also room in the toe box that causes my foot to bang the front of the shoe.
6092,120,293,0.0,2022-11-15,outdoor,The grooves are too thin to perform well outdoors.
6093,120,1,0.0,2022-11-07,outdoor,"The rubber is tough, but the treads are too narrow to take outdoors."
6094,120,7,0.0,2022-11-12,outdoor,I don't recommend using this shoe outdoors.
6095,120,2,3,2022-11-23,width,There isn't much space in the toe box. Wide footers need to be careful.
6096,120,1,3,2022-11-07,width,People with 2E feet can go true to size if they like a 1-to-1 fit or up half a size for more room.
6097,120,7,3,2022-11-12,width,Stick true to size for a 1-to-1 fit unless you have an extremely wide foot.
6098,120,5,4,2023-08-18,width,The base and forefoot feel slightly wide.

6104,121,32,8.5,2022-09-22,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom Freak 4 offers a lot of performance for a lower price. The materials aren't premium, and the traction needed a break-in period, but the shoe is a solid all-around performer."
6105,121,321,8.4,2022-10-25,expert_overall,The Nike Zoom Freak 4 has solid traction and lockdown but is offset by average cushioning.
6106,121,1,8.2,2022-09-10,expert_overall,The Nike Zoom Freak 4 is an upgrade from the Zoom Freak 3 in terms of side-to-side stability. It also offers tremendous forefoot bounce because of the Zoom Air units. People who are prone to spraining their ankles might want to look elsewhere.
6107,121,293,8.2,2022-09-15,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom Freak 4 is a lightweight shoe offering solid support, bouncy cushioning, and reliable traction. I enjoyed playing in this shoe."
6108,121,307,8.2,2022-10-10,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom Freak 4 is a solid shoe, but there are plenty of other options on the market at this price point. The traction performs well, and the shoe is breathable."
6109,121,19,8.0,2022-10-10,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom Freak 4 is a shoe for players that enjoy playing fast. It offers a propelling cushion, and the traction is solid, but you are high off the ground."
6110,121,322,9.9,2023-09-09,user_overall,the shoes cushion is really springy because of the zoom react foam on the heel and also because of the air pads recommended for centers and forwards having wide feet and want cheap and very light shoes the cushion around the ankle is really soft as Marshmallows and below of it has a hard material so its really good for ankle support the traction is really good on super clean courts but u need to wipe a bit if you play on dusty courts they kinda feel hot on the feet after a long time of playing.

6112,121,214,8.6,2023-03-31,user_overall,"The Zoom Freak 4 is a solid performer, and an upgrade on the Freak 3. The heel cushioning feels much better than the 3. I have seen conflicting info on whether or not the midsole is a cushlon foam. I think it is. The traction is great, but the grooves are very thin, so I think they will be the first thing to wear out. Thankfully the thick cored out heel and forefoot zoom air pods should give the cushioning setup a long life. Support materials feel minimal, but the lockdown is fantastic."
6113,121,323,8.2,2023-06-21,user_overall,"The traction is top tier with little to none dust pickup. Cushioning is not that soft but it is bouncy. Support is not that great because of the materials not holding up very well after time.Also as a wide-footer, I didn't have any problems with the width or"
6114,121,324,8.4,2022-09-26,user_overall,this shoe is pretty good and is a clear upgrade from the 3. the traction is really good but u have to wipe a few times on dusty courts. cushion is the best it has ever been in the freak line so no matter if you're a heel or forefoot dominant player you are fine. support is great and majorly upgraded. the fit is very wide foot friendly so narrow footers gotta try thes
6115,121,32,8.0,2022-09-22,traction,The traction allows you to make quick movements in all directions once broken in.

6117,121,1,9.0,2022-09-10,traction,The rubber compound helps the traction grip well on indoor courts.
6118,121,293,8.0,2022-09-15,traction,The traction improved a lot over the first few days of play. It performs well on clean courts and doesn't pick up much dust on dirtier courts.

6120,121,19,8.0,2022-10-10,traction,This traction may be the best in the Zoom Freak line.
6121,121,32,8.0,2022-09-22,cushion,"The Zoom Air units on the shoe are thick, which puts your foot high off the ground. It feels springy, but it took me a lot of force to activate the units."
6122,121,321,8.0,2022-10-25,cushion,"There are two Zoom pods in the forefoot and Cushlon foam. I'm not the biggest fan of the setup. The shoe is responsive, and the heel cushioning does feel soft underfoot."
6123,121,1,8.0,2022-09-10,cushion,"There are two side-by-side independent Zoom Air units in the midsole, which makes the shoe play fast."
6124,121,293,9.0,2022-09-15,cushion,The foam has a lot of compressions and provides some rebound. There are also cut-outs of foam to offer more room for the foam to expand. The Zoom units also give the shoe a springy bounce.
6125,121,307,8.0,2022-10-10,cushion,The shoe feels comfortable going up and coming down. I like the air units too.
6126,121,19,8.0,2022-10-10,cushion,"The React foam is soft and responsive, but it's not the best. The Zoom pods are effective for propelling you forward, though."
6127,121,32,8.0,2022-09-22,materials,"The materials aren't premium, but they get the job done. Performance-wise, they feel fine."
6128,121,1,8.0,2022-09-10,materials,"The upper reminds me of a 90s sweater material. It includes a lot of mesh and netting, and the materials provide a decent amount of stability."
6129,121,293,8.0,2022-09-15,materials,"The quality of the materials is a letdown. It reminds me of the materials used on the PG5, but it still feels supportive for performance purposes."
6130,121,307,8.0,2022-10-10,materials,The materials make the shoe breathable and comfortable to play in.
6131,121,19,8.0,2022-10-10,materials,"The materials aren't premium, but they hold up well. It feels nice on foot."
6132,121,32,8.0,2022-09-22,support,The outrigger and the shoe's base keep me stable and locked down.
6133,121,321,8.9,2022-10-25,support,"The shoe's structure is much better than the previous Zoom Freak model. The base is also wider, which makes the shoe more stable."
6134,121,1,8.0,2022-09-10,support,"This shoe will not hold your body weight well after the foam bottoms out, which can cause pain in your legs or back. The shoe is better for lighter players. The support and stability are an improvement overall, though."
6135,121,293,8.0,2022-09-15,support,"The torsional support isn't the best, but I didn't mind it much. I had zero issues with the lateral support and stability, though."
6136,121,307,8.0,2022-10-10,support,The shoe gives you what you need for ankle support. It was also stable and felt supportive.
6137,121,19,8.0,2022-10-10,support,"I felt contained and stable in this shoe. It's not a flexible shoe, but the stability is solid."
6138,121,32,8.0,2022-09-22,fit,"I had to choke up the laces to get the snug fit I wanted in the toe box. The length was perfect, though."
6139,121,321,8.0,2022-10-25,fit,The shoe fits nicely.
6140,121,1,8.0,2022-09-10,fit,Nike improved the fit on this year's model compared to last year's. It's more accommodating for wider feet.
6141,121,293,8.0,2022-09-15,fit,The shoe fits me like a glove. It's snug and close to being a 1-to-1 fit.
6142,121,307,8.0,2022-10-10,fit,I needed to play a bit to break the shoe in. I might go up half a size for a more comfortable fit.
6143,121,19,8.0,2022-10-10,fit,I had no issues with the fit.
6144,121,1,0.0,2022-09-10,outdoor,The rubber is too thin to grab well on outdoor courts.
6145,121,293,0.0,2022-09-15,outdoor,"The grooves are thin, and the rubber is soft. I wouldn't use this shoe outdoors."
6146,121,307,0.0,2022-10-10,outdoor,I wouldn't play outdoors with these shoes.
6147,121,1,3,2022-09-10,width,People with a 2E width foot can go up a half size for a 1-to-1 fit. People with a foot width above a 2E go up a size.
6148,121,293,2,2022-09-15,width,It's slightly narrow.
6149,121,321,3,2022-10-25,size,The shoe fits true to size.
6150,121,1,3,2022-09-10,size,Go true to size if you have a narrow or medium-sized foot.
6151,121,293,3,2022-09-15,size,I went true to size.
6152,121,307,3,2022-10-10,size,"My shoe fits true to size, but I might go up half a size if I had to rebuy it."
6153,122,293,8.8,2022-10-10,expert_overall,"The Air Jordan 37 made me feel explosive, but the cushioning can be too much for people who prefer responsiveness. The traction performed well after a few runs, and the materials feel breathable."
6154,122,7,8.7,2022-09-22,expert_overall,"In my opinion, Jordan Brand has a hit with the Air Jordan 37. The cushioning, materials, fit and support are all fantastic."
6155,122,1,8.6,2022-09-04,expert_overall,"The Jordan 37 is built for indoor performance and shines on hardwood courts. I had no issues with the traction, and the materials provided a solid lockdown."
6156,122,20,8.4,2023-07-07,expert_overall,"The Jordan 37 is a mixed bag in terms of performance. The cushioning and fit are perfect. However, the traction doesn't hold up with dust, and the stability is not good."
6157,122,112,8.2,2022-09-26,expert_overall,"I can recommend the Jordan 37 for most players. The only issue for me is the lack of heel cushioning. The forefoot cushion, traction, materials and support all performed well."
6158,122,2,8.2,2022-12-04,expert_overall,I recommend the Jordan 37 to powerful guards who get a lot of performance out of the bouncy cushion. The materials and traction are both solid. The only downside of this shoe is the price.
6159,122,33,8.0,2022-09-04,expert_overall,"The Jordan 37 steps away from features that performed excellently on the Jordan 36, but it still looks like it will be a solid performer."
6160,122,100,7.6,2023-04-16,expert_overall,"The Jordan 37 could be an impressive performer with improved support. The traction is reliable, and I enjoyed the cushioning, though."
6161,122,214,8.4,2023-03-31,user_overall,"Forefoot cushion and bounce is fantastic! Heel is a little stiff even after break-in, but does get better over time. I was skeptic about the support and materials, but was overall  very impressed with the lockdown! Forefoot feels a little more stable than the Jordan 36 since they eliminated the protruded zoom unit on the bottom of the outsole. Experienced some slip and instability on hard side step backs. The shoe is just a hair over true to size in length, but a bit narrow on the big toe area."
6162,122,189,8.6,2022-10-17,user_overall,Everything about the shoe is great with the exception of one thing. The shoe will rub off your skin on the pinky toe. I read about this before I even bought the shoe but I didn’t believe a shoe could do that but it sure does. It only did it on my right foot. Not sure why it does it because I couldn’t feel anything inside the shoe but it did enough damage to where I am returnin
6163,122,325,9.9,2023-03-17,user_overall,"I love the subtle futuristic look! Yet, still has the classic look reminiscent of the Dream Team Jordan 7s. Performance wise, a responsive almost forward propelling feel to them. Coming down from a high jump, comfortable landing. Took a few games to break in, just like many other basketball shoes. A feather weight, one of the lightest I've ever owned. Just ordered the Green olive Undefeated collab, can't wait to break someone's ankles in those too!"
6164,122,326,10.0,2023-01-15,user_overall,"I have wide feet and went true to size, these fit perfectly snug for me and contained my foot very well, defo try these on and get the size where your feet goes just beyond or is at the end of the lenoweave. These had amazing traction indoors on a slightly dusty court, cushion is amazing and I had no issue with support and stability because I had the right size. My favourite shoe to hoop in right now."
6165,122,327,9.1,2022-12-05,user_overall,"The best ankle lock ever, it glued in the shoe. No heel slippage at ALL, and i mean none. Cushion is really good, it gives a ton of energy back especially with the carbon plate. Would prefer the 37s instead of the 36s because of the "
6166,122,293,9.0,2022-10-10,traction,"After breaking the traction in, it performed much better. It has a strong bite, and it stops hard on clean courts. The performance is affected by dust, so remember to wipe."
6167,122,7,8.5,2022-09-22,traction,"The traction looks like modified herringbone. The bite was hard on clean courts, and I needed to wipe on dirtier courts."
6168,122,1,9.0,2022-09-04,traction,I had no issues with traction whatsoever.
6169,122,20,7.0,2023-07-07,traction,"The traction pattern is thick, causing the shoes to pick up dust quickly. The grip wears off with dust too. I lost confidence because of sliding."
6170,122,112,8.0,2022-09-26,traction,I had no issues with the traction whatsoever. It got the job done.
6171,122,2,8.0,2022-12-04,traction,"The traction is solid, but dusty floors affect the performance a bit."
6172,122,33,8.0,2022-09-04,traction,"If I had to guess, I'd say this will play well. Jordan Brand did go away from a traditional herringbone this time, though."
6173,122,100,9.0,2023-04-16,traction,The combination of the traction pattern and rubber compound provides impressively reliable performance.
6174,122,293,10.0,2022-10-10,cushion,"The cushioning feels insane. The Zoom Strobel and Zoom unit combination under your forefoot are crazy. It's not responsive or mellow, but explosive players will love this setup."
6175,122,7,9.0,2022-09-22,cushion,"The Formula 23 in the heel needs time to break in, but the forefoot Zoom Strobel and Zoom unit offer a ton of bounce, response, and court feel."
6176,122,1,8.0,2022-09-04,cushion,"Jordan Brand uses Formula 23, Phylon, and forefoot Double-stacked Zoom for the cushioning setup. It's solid and supportive as opposed to plush, but it does offer some bounciness."
6177,122,20,10.0,2023-07-07,cushion,The double-stacked Zoom units are wide and soft. Court feel and impact protection create a perfect combo of cushioning.
6178,122,112,8.0,2022-09-26,cushion,"The forefoot bounce of the shoe is crazy because of the Zoom Strobel and Zoom unit stacked underneath you. The back of the foot feels odd, though."
6179,122,2,9.0,2022-12-04,cushion,"Double-stacked Zoom in the forefoot makes the shoe extremely bouncy. The carbon fibre plate also keeps the shoe springy. The Formula 23 foam can be better, though."
6180,122,33,8.0,2022-09-04,cushion,"The shoe feels stiff out of the box, but the shoe should help with jumping. There's a double-stacked Zoom Strobel unit in the forefoot."
6181,122,100,8.0,2023-04-16,cushion,The cushioning in the 37 is less bouncy but more stable than the 36.
6182,122,293,9.0,2022-10-10,materials,The Leno weave material is soft and durable. I enjoy the feeling of the materials on my feet. It's thin and breathable.
6183,122,7,8.0,2022-09-22,materials,Materials on the shoe are not premium but do excel performance-wise. The shoe is lightweight and breathable.
6184,122,1,9.0,2022-09-04,materials,The leno-weave material offers forgiveness while retaining strength. It moves and flows with your foot well and is also breathable.
6185,122,20,8.0,2023-07-07,materials,The breathability is impressive. I found no issues with the construction of the shoe.
6186,122,112,8.0,2022-09-26,materials,"There isn't much padding around the shoe, and the inside feels like a low-top. It feels great on foot, and the materials are the most breathable I've ever felt. The only downside is the quality."
6187,122,2,8.0,2022-12-04,materials,I think the upper materials are a slight improvement from the Jordan 36. I prefer the structure and rigidity of the materials.
6188,122,33,8.0,2022-09-04,materials,"I don't mind the leno-weave because it's a strong material, but I'm not a fan of the setup."
6189,122,100,8.0,2023-04-16,materials,This shoe is as breathable as you can get. The upper is light too.
6190,122,293,8.0,2022-10-10,support,I had no problems with lateral containment or stability. My only issue with the support was the cushioning made me feel a bit unsteady at times.
6191,122,7,8.5,2022-09-22,support,Your foot won't move around as long as you get your proper size. The materials also do a fantastic job of keeping you contained.
6192,122,1,8.0,2022-09-04,support,The materials and shape of the shoe provide solid support once you break them in.
6193,122,20,7.0,2023-07-07,support,"I experienced wiggling in the forefoot, which compromised the lockdown. The edges of the shoe don't contain my feet well. The heel cup keeps the back of your foot locked down, though."
6194,122,112,9.0,2022-09-26,support,I had no issues with heel lockdown and comfort. The support of the shoe is excellent as well.
6195,122,2,8.0,2022-12-04,support,The Leno Weave materials feel more secure laterally on this model. The lacing system and heel counter also keep you contained.
6196,122,100,6.0,2023-04-16,support,I only felt secure when I used my ankle braces. The thin upper doesn't feel supportive.
6197,122,293,8.0,2022-10-10,fit,Going true to size gave me the right fit length-wise. It fits well and is easy to put on.
6198,122,7,9.5,2022-09-22,fit,"The fit is more accommodating than the Jordan 36 from last year. There's no break-in time needed for the materials, so the fit works well right out of the box."
6199,122,1,9.0,2022-09-04,fit,The fit of the 37 is more forgiving than the fit of the 36. The hot dog shape of the forefoot accommodates feet nicely.
6200,122,20,10.0,2023-07-07,fit,"The shoe is perfect length-wise. The padding is soft around the heel, and nothing bothers your foot during play."
6201,122,112,8.0,2022-09-26,fit,The shoe conforms to your foot well while feeling lightweight.
6202,122,2,8.0,2022-12-04,fit,There is more space in the forefoot of the shoe which affects the sizing.
6203,122,33,8.0,2022-09-04,fit,"The upper is thin and see-through, so there's room to go down half a size if you prefer a snug fit."
6204,122,100,7.0,2023-04-16,fit,"The upper doesn't hug my foot the way I want it to. There's a lot of space around the ankle, and the tongue moves a lot too."
6205,122,293,50.0,2022-10-10,outdoor,The rubber compound is more durable than previous Jordan models.
6206,122,7,50.0,2022-09-22,outdoor,The durability is holding up great.
6207,122,2,50.0,2022-12-04,outdoor,The rubber compound is thick.
6208,122,7,3,2022-09-22,width,This year's shoe is not as narrow as last year's. It's better for players with slightly wide feet. You only need to go up half a size if you have a wide foot.
6209,122,1,3,2022-09-04,width,Go up half a size if your foot is a 2E.
6210,122,2,3,2022-12-04,width,Wide-footers can go true to size.
6211,122,7,3,2022-09-22,size,I'm going to say these shoes fit true to size.
6212,122,1,3,2022-09-04,size,Go true to size if you have a narrow or medium-sized foot.
6213,122,20,3,2023-07-07,size,Go true to size.
6214,122,2,4,2022-12-04,size,I had to go down half a size.
6215,123,7,9.7,2022-11-02,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 20 is the best basketball shoe on the market. The traction and support are the best Nike's made in a long time, and the cushioning is an almost perfect combination."
6216,123,32,9.5,2022-10-25,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 20 is the best shoe in his signature lineup. The cushioning is versatile, and the traction is one of the best setups on the market."
6217,123,176,9.0,2023-05-02,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 20 could be the best Nike basketball shoe of the year. The shoe has it all. There's cushioning, speed, comfort and stability."
6218,123,5,9.0,2023-08-18,expert_overall,"I like the Nike LeBron 20 a lot. It feels versatile with a complete cushioning setup, solid traction, and a comfortable upper."
6219,123,293,8.8,2022-09-28,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 20 delivers phenomenal traction and an enjoyable, responsive cushioning setup. It feels great playing in this shoe."
6220,123,1,8.6,2022-09-22,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 20 is the best low-top basketball shoe I've tried in 2022. The shoe is quick, shifty, and contained but not the bounciest."
6221,123,104,8.6,2022-10-10,expert_overall,"Overall, I love the Nike LeBron 20. I don't have any complaints because the shoe offers something for everyone. It has good traction, cushion, and stability."
6222,123,307,8.6,2022-11-15,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 20 is an overall solid shoe I enjoyed playing in. It has solid support and traction, and the materials feel comfortable. My only gripe is the high price tag."
6223,123,20,8.6,2023-07-07,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 20 is evolving and improving. The traction is outstanding, and the fit and materials are premium. The heel lockdown was my only issue with the shoe."
6224,123,2,8.4,2022-10-20,expert_overall,The Nike LeBron 20 provides a strong traction and cushion setup that caters to a quick play style. The shoe feels comfortable and offers something for everybody.
6225,123,19,8.0,2022-12-12,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 20 has all the tech needed to be an excellent performance basketball shoe but struggles to put it together. The traction was inconsistent, and the court feel can be better."
6226,123,328,8.8,2022-10-23,user_overall,"As a preface I’ve never liked Lebron’s. Excellent traction - court I play on isn’t the best kept yet these were SUPER grippY right out of the box.  I prefer limited cushioning for more court feel and stability- I’d say XXs are a good mix of these attributes while still v comfortable. The forefoot has excellent court feel while the heel feels a little bouncier (I’m assuming this has to do with Nike Air) - I could live without this feature, but it’s popular. Materials feel excellent and durable."
6227,123,214,9.0,2023-04-08,user_overall,"The Lebron XX is a shoe that has premium materials, cushioning setup, and traction. These are a super cool shoe that offers great impact protection, breathability, and lockdown. That said, they are very heavy, and I definitely felt that when playing in them. They feel almost squishy underfoot, and offer very little court feel as a result. Despite that, I did feel very stable and secure in the shoe, no issues there. For $200, I don’t feel like they add enough to buy them over the KD 15 at $150."
6228,123,311,10.0,2023-06-17,user_overall,"Got them for 40%off and I gotta say these are the best basketball shoes I ever had. Better than PG 6 by a lil bit, better than Harden vol 6, Don Issue 4, Giannis immortality 1 and 2, AJ 36 low and PG 5. My knees were fine after 2 hours practice and that rarely happens. I can feel the zoom turbo in the right shoe a lil bit more than in the left(I just need to play more in them to be able to feel the left). After every wear this shoe gets better and better. Traction just god tier on dust and clean"
6229,123,310,8.4,2023-10-29,user_overall,"Amazing performer definitely, cushioning is not the greatest I've experienced but it is quite comfy. Traction does pick up dust quite often but I do play outdoor so I'm not fully sure how often it picks up dust indoor, otherwise the traction grips perfectly. Material is premium, as expected from the high price. Playing for 3 months outdoor my pair have held up pretty well. One downside is that I do experience bit of heel slippage but careful lacing usually fix it. Overall it is quite nice."
6230,123,169,7.7,2023-09-17,user_overall,When i played in the lebron 20s the traction was a dust magnet and the shoe never seemed to grab the floor too well. Also the toe box was VERY narrow and made the shoe uncomfortable. When i went up 1/2 size i had a lot of heel slippage ￼and couldnt slide on defense. I will say shooting in this shoe was effortless however the traction was a huge let down. I had to wipe my shoes every 2 possessions just for it to get filled w tons of dust on the next two plays very frustrating.
6231,123,7,10.0,2022-11-02,traction,I had no issues at all with traction. It's probably the best setup available.
6232,123,32,10.0,2022-10-25,traction,The traction pattern has an insane grip. The traction might be the best in the LeBron line. Make sure to wipe on dusty courts.
6233,123,176,10.0,2023-05-02,traction,The traction on the LeBron 20 is the best I've experienced in years. It sticks like crazy. I never slipped or dropped.
6234,123,5,9.0,2023-08-18,traction,"You have to wipe occasionally, but the multidirectional traction has you covered."
6235,123,293,10.0,2022-09-28,traction,The traction is so damn good. It's a top-tier performer right out of the box.
6236,123,1,10.0,2022-09-22,traction,The traction grips the court in all directions. The performance is better than everything I've tried this year.
6237,123,104,9.0,2022-10-10,traction,"The traction is good. I didn't slip, and I have no complaints at all. Just make sure you occasionally wipe."
6238,123,307,9.0,2022-11-15,traction,"I had to wipe the shoe a bit, but other than that, the traction performed fantastically."
6239,123,20,10.0,2023-07-07,traction,The traction is phenomenal. It bites and grips all surface conditions.
6240,123,2,9.0,2022-10-20,traction,The traction is tacky. It grips dusty courts well too.
6241,123,19,7.0,2022-12-12,traction,The rubber material didn't perform well for traction. I think a solid rubber outsole would be better.
6242,123,7,9.5,2022-11-02,cushion,The cushioning has a ton of impact protection and a solid court feel.
6243,123,32,10.0,2022-10-25,cushion,The forefoot Zoom unit is bouncy and feels comfortable. The cushioning overall is soft and responsive without sacrificing explosiveness.

6245,123,5,9.0,2023-08-18,cushion,"The forefoot Zoom Air feels similar to some Kyrie models. It feels more chill, but the cushioning still feels impressive. It's a complete setup without feeling excessive."
6246,123,293,9.0,2022-09-28,cushion,Full-length Cushlon felt soft to start but became much better the more I played in them. I also felt the Zoom unit underneath my forefoot. Impact protection was also solid.
6247,123,1,9.0,2022-09-22,cushion,Cushlon and a carbon fibre shank feel soft and plush underfoot. This cushioning will mould under your foot well but won't offer a bouncy feeling.
6248,123,104,9.0,2022-10-10,cushion,"Cushlon foam, a heel Zoom Air unit, and Zoom Turbo in the forefoot feel beautiful once broken in. It's a perfect blend between plush and responsive."

6251,123,2,9.0,2022-10-20,cushion,The cushion setup reminds me of the Kobe 6 setup. You feel bouncy in the forefoot after breaking it in. The Cushlon under your heel feels soft too. I dig it.
6252,123,19,7.0,2022-12-12,cushion,"The midsole has all the tech you want, but the midfoot shank and the high arch feel uncomfortable. I found the shoe hard to break in, but it has a lot of impact protection."
6253,123,7,9.0,2022-11-02,materials,The materials are free-flowing on foot with no break in time needed.
6254,123,32,8.0,2022-10-25,materials,The fabric is airy and breathable. The materials are thin but do a solid job of containing your feet.
6255,123,176,9.0,2023-05-02,materials,"The knit feels worn in and soft, but it has no give laterally. It keeps you contained without a problem."

6257,123,293,8.0,2022-09-28,materials,"The materials are thin, comfortable, and containing. It conforms to your foot nicely. The quality is not the best, but it still feels good."
6258,123,1,8.0,2022-09-22,materials,The materials Nike uses help the shoe be breathable and keep your foot dry. The weave isn't the most durable if you drag your feet.
6259,123,104,8.0,2022-10-10,materials,"The materials work for performance, but they don't feel like they are worth the high price tag of the shoe."
6260,123,307,9.0,2022-11-15,materials,"The shoe is lightweight, comfortable, and breathable on foot. It is stiff out of the box, though."
6261,123,20,9.0,2023-07-07,materials,"The materials are flexible and non-restrictive. The quality feels premium, and the shoe is lighter than previous models. The only downside is the breathability."
6262,123,2,8.0,2022-10-20,materials,"The materials are knit, and it's comfortable on foot. It also helps me feel secure."
6263,123,19,9.0,2022-12-12,materials,The materials work performance-wise.
6264,123,7,10.0,2022-11-02,support,The LeBron 20 might be the most supportive low-cut basketball shoe Nike has ever made. I had no issues with the heel counter or sliding in the shoe.
6265,123,32,8.0,2022-10-25,support,"The lacing system pulls your feet into the shoe, and the outrigger offers what you need for support."
6266,123,176,9.0,2023-05-02,support,"The shoe has some serious support, but it doesn't feel restrictive."
6267,123,5,9.0,2023-08-18,support,The midfoot shank provides stability. The footbed and midfoot containment kept me secure and saved me during a few plays.

6269,123,1,9.0,2022-09-22,support,"The lacing locks down the inner layer of the upper to keep you locked in, and the materials contain you nicely."
6270,123,104,8.0,2022-10-10,support,Lateral stability and containment perform well on the shoe. I don't have any complaints about the support.
6271,123,307,8.0,2022-11-15,support,"The ankle support was solid, but the stability does take some time to break in."
6272,123,20,7.0,2023-07-07,support,"The heel cup is not enough to contain the heel. The forefoot is locked down, and the shoe is stable laterally."
6273,123,2,8.0,2022-10-20,support,Nike uses tech they call Sphere in the heel section of the shoe. It helps secure the ankle area. The lateral containment and stability are solid.
6274,123,19,8.0,2022-12-12,support,"Nike uses, what they call, a guard rail instead of an outrigger, and it works well."
6275,123,7,10.0,2022-11-02,fit,The fit breaks in nicely and feels great overall. I enjoyed the 1-to-1 feeling.

6281,123,104,9.0,2022-10-10,fit,The fit is my favourite attribute. I got a great 1-to-1 fit out of the shoe.
6282,123,307,8.0,2022-11-15,fit,"The fit is snug, and the stiff materials make the snug fit a bit uncomfortable if you don't have the proper size. It does keep you secure, though."
6283,123,20,9.0,2023-07-07,fit,The shoe fit me perfectly. It feels like the sneaker is hugging my foot.
6284,123,2,8.0,2022-10-20,fit,The toe box has enough room to support different foot shapes.

But i recommend re lacing them so it’s not over over but under under cause for some reason i found that improve"
6308,124,329,9.2,2022-10-08,user_overall,"Traction is top tier. I’ve never had this much court feel before so i was worried about cushion but after logging 10+ hours I did not notice any pain at all from the shoes. Fit is narrow and tight at first but quickly molded perfectly to my feet. I don’t have wide feet though, wide footers be careful. My favorite shoe to play in right now."
6309,124,330,9.0,2023-03-01,user_overall,"The traction is definitely the selling point of this shoe, pretty much bites through any dusty court picks up almost no dust. Didn't matter if I was playing on a dusty rec center or training for my college team, most indoor courts felt the same. Cushion"
6310,124,331,8.7,2022-10-01,user_overall,"I love them. The traction is good, cushion is decent. Lockdown is good. I felt very fast in this shoe. It is a responsive cushion setup, but I played several hours in the shoes and my legs felt fine."

6394,126,2,8.6,2022-08-21,expert_overall,"The Nike G.T Cut 2 is perfect for players who perform a lot of twists and turns while driving to the rim. The cushioning is an improvement, but the traction takes a minor step back."
6395,126,20,8.6,2023-04-16,expert_overall,The Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2 is an outstanding performer. It's low-cut and lightweight and has perfect traction and cushioning.
6396,126,112,8.5,2022-10-02,expert_overall,The Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2 is an excellent performance basketball shoe. It's one of my favourite shoes to play in because of the cushioning and traction.
6397,126,86,8.5,2023-05-02,expert_overall,"If the Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2 had a more secure tongue, it'd be a top 2 or 3 performer. The traction and cushioning are outstanding. Its fit didn't work for me, though."
6398,126,1,8.4,2022-08-21,expert_overall,The Nike G.T. Cut 2 is a solid shoe for advanced shifty players who will benefit from the flexibility and versatility this shoe offers. It might not be the best shoe for players relying on explosiveness and stability.
6399,126,293,8.4,2022-09-17,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2 is a solid performer in all aspects. The traction isn't top-tier, and the cushioning is high off the ground, so the shoe isn't elite. It's still a fun shoe to play in, though."
6400,126,19,8.3,2022-10-02,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Zoom G.T Cut 2 improves on some aspects but takes a step back for others. If you prefer cushioning over court feel in your shoe, this shoe is better than the previous model."
6401,126,100,8.2,2023-04-16,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2 is a solid performer. The traction is incredibly reliable, and the cushioning is comfortable. Just beware of the fit around the tongue."
6402,126,76,8.8,2024-01-09,user_overall,"break in this shoe then it’s great. the cushion with the drop in react + zoom strobel is fantastic, higher off the ground than my other shoes but that can be a nice change of pace from my other shoes, no major instability from that due to the great materials and side walls of drop in. the traction, people don’t like it, but i do, it’s not top-tier and can be impacted by dust but when u need to stop it doesn’t slide out just decelerates u to move direction again, no solid bite tho. break it in!!!"
6403,126,214,8.6,2023-03-31,user_overall,"I have a love/hate relationship with this shoe. It’s best trait is availability for a fair price unlike its predecessor. The only upgrade over the original is breathability. The traction is more durable, but not better. Overall, the playability of the shoe is high. They really compliment the shooting motion, and motions from front to back feel great. Ironically, my biggest issue with these is side to side cutting motions. The height of the cushioning and lateral containment can be hard to trust."
6404,126,224,8.6,2023-02-17,user_overall,"I had some problems with the fit and consequently with the support bc I usually go 1 size up bc my foot is kinda wide and I don't like a snug fit, this combined with the drop in midsole made the shoe wider than it should for me, so the support wasn't great but the fit is comfortable is just a little wider than I liked, but I still like the shoe, specially the cushion, is very high up but I don't mind court feel so I loved it, not very durable for outdoors, the arrows on the side are gone already"
6405,126,206,8.2,2023-12-08,user_overall,"This shoe is great if you are looking for a shoe that features INCREDIBLE cushioning and a low top. The traction takes a while to finally soften and break in but afterwards the grip is solid. Cushion and the drop in midsole is perfect right outta the box, providing tons of bounce especially under your forefoot. The biggest issue with the shoe is due to the high cushioning setup, it feels very unstable to do lateral cuts and side to side movements, especially on defense. Great shoe for a PG or SG"
6406,126,336,9.6,2022-10-23,user_overall,"User of J36's mids/lows and Zion 2. Never played in the 1's. I would say that these are very good for shifty players. As long as you're not playing on a trash court, these grip hard to provide that confidence you need i"
6407,126,7,9.0,2022-08-31,traction,The traction grabs the floor nicely as you play. The performance was fantastic.
6408,126,32,8.0,2022-10-02,traction,"The traction on the shoe is solid. The tread pattern is deep and rigid, taking a lot of time to break in."
6409,126,2,8.0,2022-08-21,traction,"The traction doesn't grip as hard compared to the original G.T. Cut. It still performs well, though."
6410,126,20,10.0,2023-04-16,traction,"The traction is multidirectional, and the performance is excellent. Dust was not an issue either."
6411,126,112,9.0,2022-10-02,traction,"I love the traction on the G.T. Cut 2. I had no issues, and the traction was sticking like glue."
6412,126,86,9.0,2023-05-02,traction,The traction wrapped around the forefoot area grips the ground well. It's an improvement over the previous model.
6413,126,1,8.0,2022-08-21,traction,"The tread pattern is deep and ridged. It needed a lot of time to warm before it performed well, but the performance remained consistent on all surfaces."
6414,126,293,8.0,2022-09-17,traction,"The traction performed well after I had some time to break them in. It was inconsistent for me at times, but the performance was solid on dust."
6415,126,19,9.0,2022-10-02,traction,The traction is one of the best features of the shoe. It works when playing on all types of courts.
6416,126,100,10.0,2023-04-16,traction,The traction was grippy and reliable in every setting.
6417,126,7,10.0,2022-08-31,cushion,A full-length Zoom Strobel and a drop-in React midsole provide a low-to-the-ground cushioning system. It's a plush and bouncy ride that I enjoyed.
6418,126,32,10.0,2022-10-02,cushion,"The cushioning offers some of the best bounce and impact protection on the market. The midsole is thicker, so the foam is comfortable."
6419,126,2,10.0,2022-08-21,cushion,The drop-in midsole is much better on this shoe than the last one. It has a grip to make it easier to put on and a hex Zoom unit directly beneath your heel. The cushion features improved impact protection.
6420,126,20,10.0,2023-04-16,cushion,Impact protection feels awesome. The responsiveness is impressive too. The cushioning is top-notch.
6421,126,112,9.0,2022-10-02,cushion,"The drop-in midsole is one of my favourite features of the shoe. It offers more comfort than the previous model. I didn't experience a crazy bounce, but the impact protection was there."
6422,126,86,9.5,2023-05-02,cushion,Impact protection on the shoe is tremendous. The full-length React midsole with a small embedded hex heel Zoom Air unit and full-length Zoom Strobel is an outstanding combo.
6423,126,1,9.0,2022-08-21,cushion,The G.T. Cut 2 is similar to the last model as it also has a drop-in midsole. The shoe also has a full-length Zoom Strobel and a small Zoom Air unit in the heel. It's better for shifty players.
6424,126,293,9.0,2022-09-17,cushion,"The cushioning setup is crazy. The court feel is not good, but it has a lot of bounce, step-in comfort, and tons of compression."
6425,126,19,8.0,2022-10-02,cushion,"The React insole is thicker, which makes you sit higher within the shoe. It takes away from quickness but offers impact protection."
6426,126,100,8.0,2023-04-16,cushion,The drop-in midsole is firmer and thicker. It's not as low to the ground as the first shoe. It's comfortable yet stable.
6427,126,7,9.0,2022-08-31,materials,"The material on this shoe fit my foot better than the first Zoom G.T. Cut. It's nothing premium, but I enjoyed the setup."
6428,126,32,8.0,2022-10-02,materials,"The materials are soft and flexible but not very durable. The shoe is incredibly lightweight, though."
6429,126,2,8.0,2022-08-21,materials,The upper is screen mesh backed by an underlying fabric providing improved ventilation. There is also less plastic used on the lateral side of the shoe.
6430,126,20,7.0,2023-04-16,materials,"The laces became undone often, and the breathability could be better. The simple synthetic makes the shoe light and comfortable, though."
6431,126,112,8.0,2022-10-02,materials,"The heel slip-in feels comfortable. The laces don't feel cheap, and the rest of the shoe is breathable. I was surprised by the material quality. It's better than expected."
6432,126,86,8.0,2023-05-02,materials,"The materials are breathable and lightweight, but they could be of better quality."
6433,126,1,8.0,2022-08-21,materials,"The materials are flexible and breathable but still stable. It isn't the most durable, though."
6434,126,293,8.0,2022-09-17,materials,I feel like the materials are a downgrade from the original G.T. Cut. It feels minimal and lightweight.
6435,126,19,8.0,2022-10-02,materials,The materials are soft and breathable.
6436,126,100,8.0,2023-04-16,materials,The materials keep the shoe light. The weight distribution is improved.
6437,126,7,8.0,2022-08-31,support,"Support is where the shoe is lacking the most. The heel counter, lacing, and drop-in midsole are solid support features. I'm not a fan of the lack of torsional stability, though."
6438,126,32,7.0,2022-10-02,support,The stability is not the greatest because the shoe is high off the ground. I also had some heel slippage.
6439,126,2,8.0,2022-08-21,support,"I had solid lateral containment in this shoe, but I wish Nike had kept the lateral wing from the Cut 1. Heel containment and lockdown are the same as the previous model."
6440,126,20,7.0,2023-04-16,support,You'll be safe in the GT Cut 2 if you choose the proper size. The only lateral containment features are the lacing system and the drop-in midsole. Heel containment is not locked down. I felt movement.
6441,126,112,8.0,2022-10-02,support,"The heel lockdown is solid, and the lacing system works well. I had no issues with support and containment."
6442,126,86,8.0,2023-05-02,support,"The support mainly comes from the fit, so the other support features will keep you locked in once you get a solid fit."
6443,126,1,8.0,2022-08-21,support,"The heel counter, upper materials, and drop-in midsole offer a lot of flexibility. This setup can be good for shifty players, but players who need more stability may not like the added flexibility."
6444,126,293,9.0,2022-09-17,support,I had no issues with support and lockdown. The side wall of the drop-in midsole keeps you contained on the footbed during all moves.
6445,126,19,8.0,2022-10-02,support,"The lacing system is effective, but I don't feel as contained because of the materials. The heel cup does its job, though."
6446,126,100,8.0,2023-04-16,support,The lockdown is solid. I enjoyed the heel counter too. There was no heel slippage.
6447,126,7,9.0,2022-08-31,fit,"The fit is a bit snug, but it is a 1-to-1 fit."
6448,126,32,8.0,2022-10-02,fit,"The shoe is not as narrow as the original G.T. Cut, and the lacing system lets you customize the fit to your needs."
6449,126,2,9.0,2022-08-21,fit,The materials make this shoe better fitting than the previous model. It's much more accommodating to most feet.
6450,126,20,9.0,2023-04-16,fit,The shoe is easy to put on regardless of your foot shape. There's no break-in time needed.
6451,126,86,8.0,2023-05-02,fit,The fit is perfect length-wise. Everything is solid except for the lack of wrap-around material on the tongue. My ankle shifted a bit because of it.
6452,126,1,9.0,2022-08-21,fit,The fit was not as narrow and constricting as I thought when I played in this shoe.
6453,126,293,8.0,2022-09-17,fit,"The fit is incredibly snug. The length was perfect, though."
6454,126,100,7.0,2023-04-16,fit,A thinner tongue causes some fit issues around the top of the ankle.
6455,126,112,0.0,2022-10-02,outdoor,I wouldn't recommend this shoe for outdoor play.
6456,126,1,50.0,2022-08-21,outdoor,The rubber is hard enough to take outdoors.
6457,126,293,50.0,2022-09-17,outdoor,Durability should be decent.
6458,126,2,3,2022-08-21,width,Wide footers shouldn't have any problems.
6459,126,1,3,2022-08-21,width,Go up half a size if your foot is a 2E.
6460,126,293,2,2022-09-17,width,"If you have wide feet or don't enjoy a snug fit, go up half a size."
6461,126,2,3,2022-08-21,size,
6462,126,20,3,2023-04-16,size,The sneaker is true to size.
6463,126,112,4,2022-10-02,size,I went a half size down.
6464,126,1,3,2022-08-21,size,Go true to size if you have a narrow and medium foot.
6465,126,293,3,2022-09-17,size,True to size worked for me.
6466,127,293,9.2,2022-08-30,expert_overall,The Nike Cosmic Unity is a top-tier performer. I put this shoe alongside the KD 15 as Nike's best for the year.
6467,127,112,9.0,2022-08-21,expert_overall,It's going to be tough finding a shoe better than the Nike Cosmic Unity 2 this year. It's the best shoe I've played in all year. The traction and cushion are top-tier.
6468,127,6,8.8,2022-08-28,expert_overall,"The Nike Cosmic Unity 2 is worth the price upgrade for this year's model. The traction is insane, the cushion is bouncy, and the support is there."
6469,127,2,8.6,2022-08-24,expert_overall,"The Nike Cosmic Unity 2 is a steady sneaker. The cushion and support are solid. The traction performs well, but the shoe would be better if the traction were also top-tier."
6470,127,33,8.5,2022-08-21,expert_overall,"I expect the Nike Cosmic Unity 2 will perform well indoors and outdoors. The traction and cushion are the main features, but I am concerned with the lack of a toe guard."
6471,127,1,8.3,2022-10-10,expert_overall,"The Nike Cosmic Unity 2 has a plush cushioning setup with solid traction, but it's not good for aggressive footwork."
6472,127,7,6.7,2022-11-02,expert_overall,"The Nike Cosmic Unity 2 is not the shoe for me. I enjoyed the traction and cushioning, but the price, support and materials will keep me away."
6473,127,337,8.5,2023-09-16,user_overall,"The traction is amazing on dusty and clean courts. The cushion is well balanced, for some players it might be too much because of the full length Zoom Strobel unit but for me it was fine. Impact protection is good. Materials feel really good but there is not much breathability. Support was good overall, but I feel when I run certain fast plays that my ankle would roll. The fit was very tricky for me, normally I am a 11.5-12 but I needed to go to 10.5-11. Overall I really like this shoe."
6474,127,298,8.5,2022-10-17,user_overall,"Solid basketball shoe. Decent in every category. However it doesn’t have the best stopping impact though…It is still great and I would recommend to anyone. But for me, I just have a problem with it’s stopping impact because I like to stop instantly and shoot 2 or 3 point and this shoe doesn’t really do that so I sold it…Nike just needs to improve the traction. Also it’s not the best outdoors and I doubt it would really last."
6475,127,132,9.1,2023-06-22,user_overall,"Holy Moly These Were FREAKING AMAZING I Got Them For Outdoor Court On Concrete And Had My Opponents Ankles Deleted Because Of The Ridiculous Traction. Full Length Zoom Strobel Is Awesome. Support, Lockdown And Fit were Top-Notch. One Thing To Note Is Breathability Is Not The Best And There Is No Carbon Fiber Shank Plate But It Didn't Really Matter These Are Currently My Favorite Shoe Of The Year."
6476,127,308,8.9,2022-10-29,user_overall,Unity 2 and Jordan 36 low were both in my main rotation for quite 
6477,127,338,9.2,2023-01-30,user_overall,"Great shoe! I got this shoe for around $120 CAD. This shoe is AMAZING in all categories, except for breathability. My feet get a little warm, but it's not a deal breaker or anything. Would recommend."
6478,127,293,10.0,2022-08-30,traction,The traction needed time to break in before performing amazingly.
6479,127,112,10.0,2022-08-21,traction,The traction is top-tier. It performed phenomenally.
6480,127,6,10.0,2022-08-28,traction,The traction on the shoe is insane. It performed on clean and dusty courts with no issues.
6481,127,2,9.0,2022-08-24,traction,"The more I played, the better the traction performed. It's a tier below the best tractions."
6482,127,33,9.0,2022-08-21,traction,The traction pattern profiles like it will perform well.
6483,127,1,8.0,2022-10-10,traction,The outsole pattern produces decent traction. It grips well during play.
6484,127,7,8.5,2022-11-02,traction,The traction reminds me of the KD 15. It had me covered playing indoors.
6485,127,293,9.0,2022-08-30,cushion,The cushioning feels similar to all shoes that use a full-length Zoom Strobel. The main difference is the foam is a bit firmer than other shoes.
6486,127,112,10.0,2022-08-21,cushion,I loved the feeling of the Zoom Strobel in this shoe. It could be the best Strobel I've experienced. It's bouncy and has tons of impact protection.
6487,127,6,9.0,2022-08-28,cushion,"The carrier foam is somewhat stiff, but the full-length Zoom Strobel is bouncy with impact protection."
6488,127,2,10.0,2022-08-24,cushion,"Nike uses a full-length Zoom Strobel again, but the insole is an upgrade compared to the original Cosmic Unity. This setup is lower to the ground, so the court feel of the shoe is impressive."
6489,127,33,9.0,2022-08-21,cushion,The cushioning setup is the same as last year's model. You sit low to the ground while still receiving plush cushioning thanks to the Zoom Strobel unit.
6490,127,1,8.0,2022-10-10,cushion,"The full-length Zoom Strobel unit feels plush, and the foam feels similar to Formula 23. The cushioning setup isn't as explosive as expected, but it still feels comfortable."
6491,127,7,8.0,2022-11-02,cushion,"The Phylon midsole is soft, and the Zoom Strobel provides impact protection and court feel."
6492,127,293,10.0,2022-08-30,materials,"I feel that the materials are amazing once broken in. It's comfortable and supportive, but the ventilation could be better."
6493,127,112,8.0,2022-08-21,materials,"The knit material is thick, and the quality is nice."
6494,127,6,9.0,2022-08-28,materials,Textiles and screen mesh comprise most of the shoe. It feels softer and of higher quality compared to the Cosmic Unity.
6495,127,2,8.0,2022-08-24,materials,The mesh upper is multi-layered and features different textures. The materials don't feel as cheap as other recycled materials.
6496,127,33,8.0,2022-08-21,materials,"The materials are all textiles, and they're going to work just fine. There is no toe guard, which is something to keep an eye on."
6497,127,1,8.0,2022-10-10,materials,The materials make the Nike Cosmic Unity 2 one of the most well-constructed shoes I've tested.
6498,127,7,6.5,2022-11-02,materials,"I'm not satisfied with the quality of the materials, especially for the high price tag."
6499,127,293,8.0,2022-08-30,support,"I had zero issues with lateral containment, lockdown, and stability."
6500,127,112,9.0,2022-08-21,support,The heel slippage on the Cosmic Unity 2 is much improved. I didn't experience any slippage at all. I loved the lockdown on the shoe too.
6501,127,6,8.0,2022-08-28,support,I had no heel slippage or side-to-side movement on the footbed. The shoe ensures you're secure throughout all your moves.
6502,127,2,8.0,2022-08-24,support,The plastic on the side of the shoe provides plenty of support and containment. I also didn't have any problems with heel containment.
6503,127,7,4.0,2022-11-02,support,"The support is where the shoe is lacking the most. The heel counter works well, but my forefoot spilled over the side of the shoe. The shank plate also doesn't feel good."
6504,127,293,9.0,2022-08-30,fit,"The shoe fits me extremely well. My toes go to the edge of the shoe, and it's snug."
6505,127,112,8.0,2022-08-21,fit,The shoe fits nicely around your foot. You might need to go up half a size if you wear a brace.
6506,127,6,8.0,2022-08-28,fit,"I had no issues with the fit after breaking in the shoe. It feels snug, so if you don't like that, consider going up half a size."
6507,127,2,8.0,2022-08-24,fit,"The shoe fit long for me, so I sized down half a size for a better fit."
6508,127,33,8.0,2022-08-21,fit,"The shoe fits perfectly length-wise, but the sizing can get tricky width-wise."
6509,127,1,9.0,2022-10-10,fit,The fit was pleasantly surprising. It's forgiving after breaking the shoe in.
6510,127,7,6.5,2022-11-02,fit,"I experienced midfoot pain for the first two or three sessions, but the shoe does fit me close to 1-to-1."
6511,127,293,50.0,2022-08-30,outdoor,"The durability is not the best, but I don't think it would be terrible."
6512,127,112,0.0,2022-08-21,outdoor,I do not think you should take this shoe outside.
6513,127,2,0.0,2022-08-24,outdoor,I wouldn't recommend this shoe for outdoor use.
6514,127,7,50.0,2022-11-02,outdoor,"The rubber compound is firm enough to play outdoors, but I don't think it will last long."
6515,127,112,2,2022-08-21,width,"The shoe is slightly narrow, but it wasn't too bad."
6516,127,6,3,2022-08-28,width,"I had some pressure on my pinky toe, but it went away after breaking in the shoe."
6517,127,2,3,2022-08-24,width,Go true to size if you have a wide foot.
6518,127,1,3,2022-10-10,width,People with a 2E width foot can go true to size for a 1-to-1 fit or half a size up for more space.
6519,127,7,2,2022-11-02,width,I would avoid the shoe if I had a wide foot.
6520,127,112,3,2022-08-21,size,I recommend going true to size.

6522,127,2,4,2022-08-24,size,I went half a size down because of the length.
6523,127,1,3,2022-10-10,size,People with narrow or medium-width feet can go true to size.
6524,127,7,3,2022-11-02,size,The shoe runs true to size.
6525,128,23,9.0,2022-09-10,expert_overall,"Overall, I really like the way the Puma TRC Blaze Court performs. My only gripe is that you sit high on the midsole, but that didn't hinder performance. You feel agile and supported."
6526,128,112,8.4,2022-08-30,expert_overall,"I have no problems recommending the Puma TRC Blaze Court. The traction is phenomenal, but the materials feel cheap."
6527,128,1,8.4,2022-08-28,expert_overall,"The Puma TRC Blaze Court is an all-around shoe that offers grip, comfort, speed, and bounciness. It's best for quick and explosive-style players."
6528,128,293,7.6,2022-08-28,expert_overall,"The Puma TRC Blaze Court is a comfortable shoe, but the performance of the traction holds it back."
6529,128,339,7.2,2023-05-09,user_overall,"I've barely got to test these out. They fit comfy, and I had high hopes. Expect after 2 practice session and the following match, the sole already came apart. The literally didn't make it 1 week. I expect this to be an outlier in quality/bad glueing, but I cannot recommend these based on my experience lasting this little."
6530,128,340,6.4,2023-10-18,user_overall,"￼ These shoes are great when you’re fresh on the court. But when you get tired, the lack of cushioning really starts wearing down your feet. I get blisters every time I play in them. If you have a lot of stamina, I recommend them, but if not, I would stay away. They’re also beginning to rip by the eyelets."
6531,128,341,8.8,2022-10-16,user_overall,"puma made a very good effort with this shoe but the materials are not good at all, I had to change 2 pairs of shoes because the sole came off from the bottom on both.  they were very comfortable for me even if they didn't have the best traction.  I took Luka 1 and calmed down"
6532,128,342,5.0,2023-04-26,user_overall,"The shoes were alright but the durability is terrible, I had two pairs because they sent me a replacement pair, both times the tread came off within 4 games right where the plate is exposed."
6533,128,343,7.6,2024-09-10,user_overall,the traction was a major letdown as it couldnt handle dusty courts.
6534,128,23,8.8,2022-09-10,traction,The traction configuration provides coverage for all directions. I had no issues with the performance of the traction.
6535,128,112,9.0,2022-08-30,traction,Traction is my favourite part of this shoe. It performed phenomenally on the court.
6536,128,1,9.0,2022-08-28,traction,You're covered with traction no matter what direction you're moving or what surface you're on.
6537,128,293,7.0,2022-08-28,traction,"The traction is the weak point of the shoe. It performs solidly on clean courts, but I experienced inconsistency and some sliding."
6538,128,23,9.2,2022-09-10,cushion,"The cushioning offers a blend of impact protection, bounciness, and responsiveness. You sit high off the ground with this setup, though."
6539,128,112,8.0,2022-08-30,cushion,"The cushioning feels soft, the insole is comfortable, and I enjoyed the setup."
6540,128,1,9.0,2022-08-28,cushion,"This shoe is the bounciest shoe I've ever tested on my channel. The foam is lightweight, and the shank is stiff. It was easy to jump in this shoe."
6541,128,293,8.0,2022-08-28,cushion,"The cushioning setup was a pleasant surprise. It's comfortable, responsive, and offers some impact protection."
6542,128,23,6.5,2022-09-10,materials,"Materials are the feature that could've improved the most. The upper feels cheap, and there's room for more premium materials."
6543,128,112,7.0,2022-08-30,materials,"The materials feel cheap, like a low-budget version of the MB.01. It is decently padded, though."
6544,128,1,8.0,2022-08-28,materials,Puma does not skimp on the materials where it counts. It's minimal but has strategically placed reinforcements.
6545,128,293,7.0,2022-08-28,materials,"The quality of the materials is low, but I can't complain considering the price. There were no performance issues, though."
6546,128,23,9.0,2022-09-10,support,The support on the shoe excels. The rubber overlays offer lateral containment and stability.
6547,128,112,9.0,2022-08-30,support,"I had no issues with heel lockdown, and the support felt great overall."
6548,128,1,8.0,2022-08-28,support,The tie-down keeps you contained and locked in despite the TRC Blaze Court being a minimal shoe.
6549,128,293,8.0,2022-08-28,support,I had no issues with the lateral containment because of the material setup on the side of the shoe.
6550,128,23,8.5,2022-09-10,fit,The shoe fits perfectly one-to-one and is more on the snug side.
6551,128,112,9.0,2022-08-30,fit,I had no issues with the fit. It felt amazing on my foot.
6552,128,1,8.0,2022-08-28,fit,The fit is accommodating for most foot shapes and sizes.
6553,128,293,8.0,2022-08-28,fit,"My toes go to the edge of the shoe, and the shoe fits snugly."

6556,128,293,0.0,2022-08-28,outdoor,This shoe is not the best option for outdoor courts.
6557,128,293,3,2022-08-28,width,Width is not an issue.
6558,128,112,3,2022-08-30,size,I went true to size.
6559,128,1,3,2022-08-28,size,Go true to size if you have a narrow or medium-width foot.
6560,128,293,3,2022-08-28,size,"I went true to size, and it fits me well."
6561,129,112,8.2,2022-09-06,expert_overall,"I definitely recommend the Puma Rise NITRO. The cushioning, traction, and materials work together to provide a comfortable shoe."
6562,129,23,8.0,2022-08-28,expert_overall,"The Puma Rise Nitro plays similarly to the MB.01 Low. It has a reliable fit, support, and materials, but it doesn't play well outdoors. The cushioning is also underwhelming."
6563,129,293,8.0,2022-11-15,expert_overall,"The Puma Rise NITRO is a solid shoe held back by the traction pattern. It has average traction, but the cushioning feels comfortable, and the materials are better than expected."
6564,129,2,8.0,2022-12-04,expert_overall,The Puma Rise NITRO is a comfortable performance shoe with flexible materials and dependable traction. I only wish the cushion was plusher.
6565,129,3,8.0,2023-04-13,expert_overall,"The Puma Rise NITRO is a solid performer. It's not top-tier, but not awful. The stability is the main standout feature, and the traction performs well."
6566,129,1,8.0,2023-08-24,expert_overall,The Puma Rise NITRO is a fantastic shoe for players who contort their feet during movements. The shank plate and foam make the shoe feel bouncy and springy.
6567,129,296,8.2,2022-09-25,user_overall,"It´s a bit bulky shoe, not a lot forefoot flex. On the other side, i had no problem with traction or cushion. Good shoe, maybe not for the guards in need of a flexible shoe!"

6573,129,23,8.0,2022-08-28,traction,"The traction is best on lateral movements and cuts. I didn't slip or have any other issues with the performance. Overall, it's reliable."
6574,129,293,7.0,2022-11-15,traction,"The traction performance took a while to break in, but it still felt middle of the pack."
6575,129,2,8.0,2022-12-04,traction,The traction is another highlight of the shoe. It grabs the floor nicely.
6576,129,3,8.0,2023-04-13,traction,"The traction works well, but it's not squeaky."
6577,129,1,8.0,2023-08-24,traction,The traction performs best when moving from side to side instead of linearly.
6578,129,112,8.0,2022-09-06,cushion,The cushioning is one of my favourite parts of the shoe. The foam feels soft and reminds me of Adidas's Bounce cushioning.
6579,129,23,7.0,2022-08-28,cushion,"I wasn't impressed with the Nitro cushioning. It provides some responsiveness and bounce, but it could be better."
6580,129,293,8.0,2022-11-15,cushion,The full-length Nitro foam feels comfortable with tons of impact protection. It just isn't bouncy.
6581,129,2,7.0,2022-12-04,cushion,"The Nitro foam is not too impressive, in my opinion. It is low to the ground and responsive, though."
6582,129,3,7.0,2023-04-13,cushion,The cushioning is decent. Nothing special. The responsiveness is alright too.
6583,129,1,9.0,2023-08-24,cushion,Puma's EVA foam feels bouncy and elastic. The shank placement is also impressive for explosiveness. It makes getting in the air feel very easy.
6584,129,112,9.0,2022-09-06,materials,"The shoe is well padded, which feels comfortable. I enjoyed how the materials felt during play."
6585,129,23,8.0,2022-08-28,materials,"The knit materials are soft and snug. The shoe also includes a lot of padding. Breathability is not good, though."
6586,129,293,9.0,2022-11-15,materials,The quality of the knit materials is amazing for the price. It feels cozy and comfortable.
6587,129,2,8.0,2022-12-04,materials,The upper is a dual-layered knit material that feels durable and comfortable.
6588,129,3,8.0,2023-04-13,materials,These are heavy. The upper is soft in hand.
6589,129,1,7.5,2023-08-24,materials,The upper elastic mesh wrap feels substantial. Your forefoot can move freely without issue. The material is durable but not breathable.
6590,129,112,8.0,2022-09-06,support,The heel lockdown was amazing on this shoe. The materials also keep you contained nicely.
6591,129,23,8.0,2022-08-28,support,"Once you lace the shoes up, your feet aren't going anywhere. The containment is solid."
6592,129,293,8.0,2022-11-15,support,The lateral containment and stability were exceptional.
6593,129,2,8.0,2022-12-04,support,The strategically placed PWR tape and the lateral support pieces keep you secure. The heel cup also provides stability.
6594,129,3,9.0,2023-04-13,support,Stability and support are excellent. The lockdown is secure too.
6595,129,1,7.5,2023-08-24,support,The elastic upper and lacing system lets you move your feet freely while feeling supported.
6596,129,112,8.0,2022-09-06,fit,Puma also includes Power Tape to help with the fit and support. It conforms to your feet nicely.
6597,129,23,9.0,2022-08-28,fit,"My favourite thing about the shoe is the fit. It's a close and snug, 1-to-1 fit."
6598,129,293,8.0,2022-11-15,fit,"The fit feels tight. I prefer a snug fit, but this shoe is too snug. I would enjoy this fit better if I went up half a size."
6599,129,2,9.0,2022-12-04,fit,The snugness of the sneaker is a highlight because it provides a 1-to-1 fit. It feels like the shoe hugs your foot.
6600,129,3,8.0,2023-04-13,fit,"The forefoot feels very snug, but the shoe hugs your foot nicely."
6601,129,1,8.0,2023-08-24,fit,The upper provides a glove-like fit. The upper setup and materials accommodate all foot shapes.
6602,129,293,0.0,2022-11-15,outdoor,Durability seems bad.
6603,129,2,50.0,2022-12-04,outdoor,"The rubber is durable, but the grooves are really thin."
6604,129,3,0.0,2023-04-13,outdoor,The outsole grooves do not look durable.
6605,129,1,0.0,2023-08-24,outdoor,The treads are too thin to use outdoors.
6606,129,293,2,2022-11-15,width,Go up a full size if you have a wide foot.
6607,129,2,2,2022-12-04,width,The shoe feels narrow.
6608,129,3,2,2023-04-13,width,The toe box is very snug.
6609,129,293,2,2022-11-15,size,I recommend going up at least half a size.
6610,129,3,3,2023-04-13,size,This shoe fits true to size.
6611,129,1,3,2023-08-24,size,"Narrow, medium, and wide footers can go true to size."
6612,130,6,8.0,2022-07-03,traction,"The full-length HOVR cushioning doesn't provide much impact protection, but it is responsive and provides a lot of court feel."
6613,130,6,8.0,2022-07-03,cushion,"The HOVR Splash features a textile mesh that performs well. It isn't the best quality, though."
6614,130,6,8.0,2022-07-03,materials,I didn't have any support issues in this shoe.
6615,130,6,8.0,2022-07-03,support,"In terms of fit, the length is short, and the shoe has little dead space in the toe box area. It conforms to your foot nicely."
6616,131,6,7.8,2022-08-08,expert_overall,"The Nike Giannis Immortality 2 is a solid shoe for the price. The materials are the best part of the shoe, and the support is there, too."
6617,131,293,7.8,2022-08-16,expert_overall,"The Nike Giannis Immortality 2 is a step back from the original. I had fit issues caused by the materials. The traction performed well after breaking it in, and the cushioning is responsive, though."
6618,131,348,7.5,2022-07-07,expert_overall,"The Nike Giannis Immortality 2 is a solid budget offering, but it doesn't do much to differentiate itself from last year's Immortality 1. It has the traction, fit, and support needed for most guards on a budget."
6619,131,23,7.5,2022-08-08,expert_overall,"The Nike Giannis Immortality is an above-average performer but remains a very good budget option. The traction and responsive cushion make it a solid pick for smaller, quicker players."
6620,131,311,8.5,2023-05-03,user_overall,"It’s like the immortality 1 but the materials are better imo. Very lightweight, responsive cushion, good traction on dust. I went up a half size because the first immortality was fittings me very snug and I have a narrow foot. If you go true to size we aware of really snug fit. Just a must for lightweight players that are fast and need something light. These are a banger imo for the price you can get them rn. I got them for 45 usd"
6621,131,349,7.8,2023-05-16,user_overall,"The Giannis Immortality 2 is a good shoe for hoopers on a budget. De traction is 'ok', it holds up pretty well outdoors too. I have slightly narrow feet and the shoes fit me like a glove. The materials are comfortable en breathable bus feel a bit cheap in hand. The big downfall for me is the cushioning. You barely feel the impact protection and there is no bounce. Overall a solid budget shoe."
6622,131,350,9.0,2023-05-04,user_overall,Everything is good about the shoe it has top tier traction good impact protection and comfort the heel is a bit high but its easy to get use to its very bouncy and comfortable and fits perfect the only problem is the lateral stability and cheap material but its not that bad its the shoe is underrated and overhated the lateral stability isn't that bad and the materials are good for the price
6623,131,351,8.4,2023-06-18,user_overall,"I used this shoe outdoors and the traction was good and the cushion was alright as well. The materials are very breathable but very soft if that’s something you like. My only problem with this shoe is the support because sometimes my foot feels like it’s coming out of the shoe but besides that, really good shoe for it’s price"
6624,131,352,8.7,2025-04-20,user_overall,I have played over a year in this shoe and I had no issues apart from the cushion which was very stiff and low quality. Apart from this the traction was great and support me on all moves on the court. Overall this shoe is a great budget friendly option and comes with some amazing colour ways.
6625,131,6,8.0,2022-08-08,traction,"If you play on clean courts, you won't have any problems with traction. I did sometimes slide on dusty courts, though."
6626,131,293,9.0,2022-08-16,traction,"The traction pattern is the same as the first shoe, and it took some time to break in. Once broken in, it performed well. I would place it just below top-tier."
6627,131,348,8.5,2022-07-07,traction,The traction on this year's shoe is exactly the same as last year's. The performance is solid.
6628,131,23,8.5,2022-08-08,traction,"I had zero issues with the traction on clean courts, but it does need wiping in dusty conditions."
6629,131,6,7.0,2022-08-08,cushion,"The foam is somewhat firm, and there isn't much impact protection."
6630,131,293,7.5,2022-08-16,cushion,"The cushioning setup is nothing special, but it is soft and responsive."
6631,131,348,7.0,2022-07-07,cushion,The cushioning offers court feel and responsiveness but not much impact protection.
6632,131,23,7.0,2022-08-08,cushion,The cushion is responsive and provides a solid court feel but doesn't offer much impact protection.
6633,131,6,8.0,2022-08-08,materials,The Immortality 2's engineered mesh feels like an improvement compared to last year's shoe.
6634,131,293,8.0,2022-08-16,materials,"The materials are softer but less supportive. It's thin and minimal, though. Durability could be an issue."
6635,131,348,6.0,2022-07-07,materials,"The materials are cheap but functional. The shoe is lightweight, which is a plus."
6636,131,23,6.0,2022-08-08,materials,"A lightweight mesh and fuse overlays comprise most of the shoe, and there's also a lot of synthetic leather on the tongue and heel portions of the shoe."
6637,131,6,8.0,2022-08-08,support,"I didn't have any issues with the support in this shoe. My ankle felt contained, and my feet weren't sliding."
6638,131,293,7.5,2022-08-16,support,"My foot stretched against the materials during play. Lateral containment was solid, but the roomy fit and materials meant my foot was not snug on the footbed. Lateral stability was not an issue, though."
6639,131,348,8.0,2022-07-07,support,The support features keep you locked down and provide a wide base to keep you centered.
6640,131,23,8.0,2022-08-08,support,"The upper of the shoe keeps your foot locked down to the footbed, while the base and outrigger keep you centered."
6641,131,6,8.0,2022-08-08,fit,I had no dead space in the shoe. The materials do a very good job of lying over your foot.
6642,131,293,7.0,2022-08-16,fit,"There's some length at the end of the shoe, and the materials stretch to make the toe box roomy. I liked the fit right out of the box, but the more I played in them, the more the fit stretched."
6643,131,348,8.0,2022-07-07,fit,"It fits like a glove. In the beginning, the fit is snug, but it'll break in the more you play."
6644,131,23,8.0,2022-08-08,fit,The shoe fits like a glove and conforms to your foot nicely.
6645,131,6,50.0,2022-08-08,outdoor,The durability of the outsole should be okay outside.
6646,131,293,50.0,2022-08-16,outdoor,"The rubber is hard, and it should hold up outdoors."

6648,131,293,3,2022-08-16,size,I went true to size.
6649,132,307,9.4,2022-08-04,expert_overall,"The Jordan Luka 1 is as good as it gets. It is one of the best performance basketball shoes available right now. Traction, cushion, and support are all there."
6650,132,1,8.8,2022-07-26,expert_overall,"Luka Doncic's first signature shoe, the Jordan Luka 1, is a performance-first shoe. While they're newer and you're using them for intense play, they'll perform phenomenally."
6651,132,7,8.6,2022-08-08,expert_overall,"I really enjoyed playing in the Jordan Luka 1. The big drawback is that the cushioning could be better. Otherwise, it's a fantastic buy at retail because the traction is top-tier, and the support features perform well."
6652,132,33,8.5,2022-07-26,expert_overall,"The Jordan Luka 1 features a brand new cushion setup called Formula 23, and it feels fantastic under your feet. The traction also feels tacky, and the support is there. This shoe has all the makings of a solid performer."
6653,132,100,8.5,2022-08-24,expert_overall,"The Jordan Luka 1 is an excellent performer. Players who value traction, fit adaptability, and court feel will enjoy this shoe."
6654,132,112,8.5,2022-09-15,expert_overall,"The Jordan Luka 1 is definitively a shoe I can recommend for guards. It has top-tier traction and feels comfortable on foot. You can't expect much cushioning, though."
6655,132,32,8.5,2022-10-16,expert_overall,"The Jordan Luka 1 makes you feel shifty and agile, and it's the perfect shoe for guards. The traction, support, and lockdown are standout features."
6656,132,2,8.4,2022-07-26,expert_overall,The Jordan Luka 1 is a stable hoop shoe that caters to players who prefer responsive performance. It offers extra support but isn't the bounciest.
6657,132,321,8.2,2022-09-06,expert_overall,"Overall, I enjoyed playing in the Jordan Luka 1. The support and lockdown feel comfortable with every move I made, and the materials are lightweight."

6660,132,353,8.8,2023-04-03,user_overall,Traction is one of the best of 2022-2023 and lateral stability is some of the best I’ve eve
6661,132,320,9.2,2023-04-30,user_overall,"Great all around performer, especially for the low price. The traction is very grippy, but picks up dust quickly and the grooves, while hard and wide, are rather shallow, so unsure outside. Formula 23 foam was alright, stiff and caged, but also low to the ground and responsive. Support and Comfort was really good, the Flight Wire and Iso Plate kept my foot locked in and stable, while still being comfortable. The tongue and heel are very well padded, and kept me comfy. A must have shoe for sure."
6662,132,354,9.0,2023-09-07,user_overall,"I really enjoyed playing in this shoe. It is light and breathable with great indoor traction and pretty good outdoor traction. I would highly recommend this shoe to a laterally quick guard seeking a bouncy and explosive shoe. Although the shoes features are effective, they are somewhat unconventional. For example, the cushioning, this feature is effective and one of my favorites it may be bothersome to people expecting Nike Zoom Air Tech. In conclusion, I totally recommend this shoe for a guard."
6663,132,355,8.2,2023-01-15,user_overall,"I really like the design of these first of all. The traction definitely was good, however when you picked up a bit of dust it did kind of slip for me so just be sure to wipe. Cushion was kinda not good for me. What I like in cushion is good impact protection, a bit of bounce, and some responsiveness and some court feel. Impact protection was okay, my feet would hurt after wearing them for a little while. I never got to test out bounce unfortunately though however, it’s very responsive."
6664,132,224,9.2,2023-02-05,user_overall,"I loved this shoe, it's better than the pg6 in my opinion, the traction is fucking amazing, cushion is worse than the pg6 but really responsive, I like a narrou fit so it was great for me, you feel very locked in, the support is better than the pg6, and I really like the materials but the pg6 are better, and it surprised me a lot on the durability, I only played outdoors with it so far and the traction is on perfect condition, amazing shoe for Point guards."
6665,132,307,10.0,2022-08-04,traction,The traction was amazing. I had no issues whatsoever.
6666,132,1,10.0,2022-07-26,traction,The outsole tread is the best feature of the shoe. It offers tons of stopping power in all directions.
6667,132,7,9.0,2022-08-08,traction,"This traction performs fantastically. It worked indoors, and dust didn't affect the performance much."
6668,132,33,9.0,2022-07-26,traction,"The outsole feels extra grippy. The patterns are also multidirectional, which looks like they will perform nicely."
6669,132,100,9.0,2022-08-24,traction,"The multi-directional traction pattern performs well. It covers all your movements and change of direction, even on dusty courts."
6670,132,112,10.0,2022-09-15,traction,The traction is top-tier and almost makes up for the lack of cushioning.
6671,132,32,9.0,2022-10-16,traction,"After breaking in the traction, it performed incredibly. The only downside is that it attracts dust quickly."
6672,132,2,10.0,2022-07-26,traction,The traction pattern offers both linear and diagonal coverage. The shoe has one of the best traction setups I've tested recently.

6676,132,307,10.0,2022-08-04,cushion,The shoe is comfortable straight out of the box. I didn't need to break the cushioning in before I felt the impact protection and bounce.
6677,132,1,9.0,2022-07-26,cushion,Jordan Brand uses a new foam called Formula 23 inside a Phylon carrier for this shoe. The foam setup combined with the unique shank implementation provides plenty of explosiveness.
6678,132,7,7.0,2022-08-08,cushion,"The Formula 23 foam feels like Phylon with some elasticity. I didn't have much foot pain, but the shoe didn't feel explosive."
6679,132,33,9.0,2022-07-26,cushion,Jordan Brand's new Formula 23 foam cushion instantly wowed me when I put the Luka 1s on. I think the implementation of the shoes cushioning is fascinating.

6682,132,32,8.0,2022-10-16,cushion,"The Formula 23 foam provides responsive support underfoot, but the foam isn't bouncy."
6683,132,2,8.0,2022-07-26,cushion,The new Formula 23 foam looks like React but feels more like a gel-like foam featured in some Asics shoes. It's low-to-the-ground and responsive.
6684,132,321,7.0,2022-09-06,cushion,"The cushioning had no impact protection, but it was low-to-the-ground and responsive."
6685,132,19,7.0,2022-10-10,cushion,"I don't feel the difference between Formula 23 and other Phylon cushions. It's soft, but my foot sat too high on the midsole."
6686,132,293,7.0,2022-08-16,cushion,"Formula 23 is the foam used in the Jordan Luka 1. It's low to the ground and responsive, but there isn't much plushness."
6687,132,307,9.0,2022-08-04,materials,Ventilation was not a problem for me during play.
6688,132,1,9.0,2022-07-26,materials,"The upper is a sock-liner upper with a three-piece tongue. The downside is the breathability, but the upside is the materials feel comfortable on your foot."
6689,132,7,7.5,2022-08-08,materials,"The material setup is cheap feeling, but it performs great on the court."
6690,132,33,8.0,2022-07-26,materials,"I'm not impressed with the textile materials used on the upper portion of the shoe. From a performance standpoint, they do feel like they will play amazingly."

6692,132,112,8.0,2022-09-15,materials,"The laces feel low-quality to me, but it won't affect performance. The tongue felt comfortable, and I enjoyed how it fit. My only gripe is that I wish they included some more padding."
6693,132,32,8.0,2022-10-16,materials,The materials are lightweight and flexible. It just doesn't feel premium.
6694,132,2,8.0,2022-07-26,materials,"Jordan Brand's Flightwire makes up the upper of the shoe, and it reminds me of the Cosmic Unity uppers."
6695,132,321,8.5,2022-09-06,materials,The materials feel lightweight and supportive.
6696,132,19,9.0,2022-10-10,materials,The upper is one of the best features of the shoe. It's supportive and contains my foot well. My only complaint is it doesn't hug my foot.
6697,132,293,8.0,2022-08-16,materials,Jordan uses Flightwire on the upper of the shoe. It's thin and supportive while also conforming to your feet nicely.

6699,132,1,8.0,2022-07-26,support,"The containment of the shoe performs well, and it feels plenty stable."
6700,132,7,9.5,2022-08-08,support,"The lacing setup draws your foot back into the heel cup, and combined with the Flightwire, it keeps you contained laterally."
6701,132,33,8.5,2022-07-26,support,The support pieces on the side of the shoe make it strong from a torsional standpoint.
6702,132,100,8.5,2022-08-24,support,The unconventional IsoPlate torsion system setup works well to keep you stable during movement. It provides torsional support and is flexible too.

6704,132,32,9.0,2022-10-16,support,My foot felt supported and contained within the shoe. The Isoplate also provides plenty of torsional support.
6705,132,2,8.0,2022-07-26,support,The shoe offers maximum support when making side-steps and other lateral moves. I also had no heel slippage.
6706,132,321,9.5,2022-09-06,support,The support and lockdown are my favourite aspects of the shoe. I felt locked down after every move I made.
6707,132,19,8.0,2022-10-10,support,The Isoplate provides stability at the cost of flexibility in the forefoot.
6708,132,293,8.0,2022-08-16,support,The material is very supportive. I had no issues with lateral containment.

6713,132,100,9.0,2022-08-24,fit,My favourite part of the shoe is its adaptable fit.
6714,132,32,8.0,2022-10-16,fit,"The shoe ran a bit short length-wise, but I had plenty of wiggle room width-wise. The lacing helped me dial in the fit well."

6718,132,293,7.0,2022-08-16,fit,"The fit is not the best for me. The toe box is roomy, and there's more space in the forefoot than I would like."

6720,132,7,0.0,2022-08-08,outdoor,I would caution against using these shoes outdoors.

6725,132,1,3,2022-07-26,size,"The shoe build is a bit wider, so narrow, medium, and wide-footers can go true to size."

6731,133,1,8.8,2022-07-26,expert_overall,The Li-Ning Way of Wade 10 is definitely an upgrade when compared to the Way of Wade 9. This shoe is a versatile performer that can play well for both nimble and aggressive players.
6732,133,2,8.8,2022-07-26,expert_overall,The Li-Ning Way of Wade 10 is a top performer for players that only play on indoor wooden courts. I had a lot of fun playing with this cushion and material setup.
6733,133,293,8.8,2022-08-08,expert_overall,"Overall, the Li-Ning Way of Wade 10 is such a fun shoe to play in. It feels quick, the support features are there, and the cushioning is fantastic."

6739,133,356,9.8,2024-03-11,user_overall,Best basketball shoes I have ever played in. I bought them a year ago. They immediately became and still are my go-to shoes for basketball. Top tier traction and the step in comfort is off the charts. If you don’t like a snug feel or have wide feet I’d go up half a size. I think they even recommend that on their site. Best basketball shoes I have ever played in. I bought them a year ago. They immediately became and still are my go-to shoes for basketball. Any type of player can wear these.
6740,133,357,9.5,2023-12-18,user_overall,"Traction is top-tier on clean indoor courts. On dusty courts, I had to wipe the bottom of the shoe frequently, but they still had an overall good grip. Lockdown and support are amazing, with no heel slip, or movement inside the shoe. The cushion under the heel is unreal, however the cushion lacks a little bit in the forefoot. With the heel being higher up than the toes the shoe feels springy and responsive with a great court feel."
6741,133,358,9.8,2022-07-31,user_overall,"mind-blowingly good shoe. Plays fast, doesn't feel too high. Cushioning is peak, has the plushness of boost with the bounce of zoom. Great for athletic players who need to remain quick-footed but love a bit of explosiveness when going to the rack or playing above the rim. Support and materials have me feeling locked in and taken care of. Traction is a beast too. Best shoe I've tried in a while no doubt."
6742,133,20,9.0,2023-05-04,traction,The grip is excellent. It didn't let me down on any indoor courts.

6749,133,20,10.0,2023-05-04,cushion,The cushioning is perfectly balanced. The Boom foam is bouncy and responsive. There's both energy return and impact protection.

6752,133,293,10.0,2022-08-08,cushion,"Li-Ning's full-length Boom cushion feels outstanding, but the Strobel board is the real star of this shoe. The shoe has great impact protection while also feeling explosive."

6755,133,33,10.0,2022-08-08,cushion,The full-length Boom cushion feels bouncier in this model than last year's. It's a great setup for players looking for bounciness.

6764,133,1,9.0,2022-07-26,support,The upper provides tremendous lockdown for being such a lightweight material. The forefoot shape makes this shoe ultra-stable.
6765,133,2,8.0,2022-07-26,support,The shoe has a nice amount of ankle protection and comfort. I had no issues with the support either.

Ones when i was going for dunk and when i landed it really hurt on impact. Now if you want budget shoe with better cushion go for Renew Elevate 2 (Renew Elevate 3 also have good cushion but overall Renew Elevate 2 is better. And it maybe hard to find RE2)"

I'd recommend these to any player doesn't matter what your playstyle is they're an amazing pair to have."

6799,134,6,8.0,2022-08-04,traction,The traction of this shoe performed really well. The only issue I had was the shoe picking up dust quickly.
6800,134,307,9.0,2022-08-04,cushion,"For my preferences, the shoe was very comfortable to wear. I enjoyed how it felt."
6801,134,293,6.0,2022-08-04,cushion,"The cushioning setup sucks. It has no impact protection, but it does have responsiveness because the shoe is stiff."
6802,134,6,7.0,2022-08-04,cushion,"You get a bit of compression and bounce back, but it's more of a court feel and responsiveness shoe."
6803,134,307,8.0,2022-08-04,materials,"The shoe is lightweight, but the breathability and durability could be better."
6804,134,293,8.0,2022-08-04,materials,The Nike Precision 6 uses a soft and comfortable textile material.
6805,134,6,8.0,2022-08-04,materials,"A textile covers the front half of the shoe, and a mesh covers the back half. I have no complaints performance-wise."
6806,134,307,8.0,2022-08-04,support,The support in the shoe performed better than expected.
6807,134,293,9.0,2022-08-04,support,I was surprised by how much lateral containment this shoe provided. Lateral stability and ankle security also weren't an issue.
6808,134,6,8.0,2022-08-04,support,I had no issues with the support features on this shoe. The materials and fit work together well to contain your foot.
6809,134,307,8.0,2022-08-04,fit,I had no issues with the fit of the shoe.
6810,134,293,8.0,2022-08-04,fit,"The shoe conforms to your foot nicely. There is some extra length at the front of the shoe, though."
6811,134,6,8.0,2022-08-04,fit,"The shoe has good sculpting around the heel, and there's no dead space in the toe box. I enjoyed the fit of this shoe."
6812,134,307,50.0,2022-08-04,outdoor,The traction didn't perform as well outdoors as it did indoors.
6813,134,293,100.0,2022-08-04,outdoor,You should be good to go for outdoor play.
6814,134,6,2,2022-08-04,width,You might want to go up half a size if you have wide feet.
6815,134,293,3,2022-08-04,size,I went true to size.
6816,134,6,3,2022-08-04,size,"I went true to size and felt some pinching, but it wasn't too serious."
6817,135,307,10.0,2022-08-08,expert_overall,"I had a lot of fun playing in the Puma MB.01 Lo. To me, these are the perfect basketball shoe. The traction and cushion are top-notch, and the stability is fantastic."
6818,135,33,9.4,2022-08-08,expert_overall,"The Puma MB.01 Low is one of the best and most versatile performance shoes on the market. It packs an aggressive traction pattern, balanced cushioning, and support features that get the job done."
6819,135,7,8.2,2022-08-08,expert_overall,"The Puma MB.01 is a fantastic shoe at a great price. The traction is reliable, and the cushion offers an impressive mix of court feel and impact protection."
6820,135,293,8.0,2022-08-16,expert_overall,"The Puma MB.01 Lo is not a shoe I can recommend over the mid-top version. It's still a solid shoe, but the traction didn't perform as well for me on the Lo compared to the original."
6821,135,361,8.8,2022-08-17,user_overall,"Shoe is not the best right out of the box, to begin with there was a slight heel slippage. But it did not last long once I broke the shoes in. Cushion is very plush, yet responsive. Traction is great on clean or dusty conditions, and has minimal dust pickup. Although the shoe is a little heavy for a low top, this is a solid pick-up!"
6822,135,328,8.0,2022-10-23,user_overall,"An above average shoe. Nice snug fit, good mix of cushion/support and stability/court feel. Grip is decent. Only con is I think they feel slightly larger/heavier than they need to be. This is personal preference as I prefer less cushion/bounce and more court feel."
6823,135,362,7.9,2022-10-01,user_overall,"the traction needed time to break in but still was pretty ehhh, picked up a lot of dust, everything was good"
6824,135,363,8.2,2022-10-29,user_overall,"Very good all around shoe, ankle support isn’t the best but it’s a low top so what do you expect."
6825,135,364,9.0,2022-12-13,user_overall,"overall the shoe is good, the only downside is the traction, it’s picks up dust frequently"
6826,135,307,10.0,2022-08-08,traction,I didn't need to wipe my feet one time. The traction performs well.
6827,135,33,10.0,2022-08-08,traction,"Traction is the best feature of the shoe. It's the same as the high-top version, so it's aggressive and grippy."
6828,135,7,9.5,2022-08-08,traction,This traction setup is phenomenal. It is the best translucent outsole out right now.
6829,135,293,8.0,2022-08-16,traction,"The solid rubber outsole had a long break-in period. It didn't perform as well as the translucent outsoles, but it was still solid."
6830,135,307,10.0,2022-08-08,cushion,Taking off and landing feel good. It's comfortable to play in these shoes.
6831,135,33,10.0,2022-08-08,cushion,Puma's full-length Nitro foam is the perfect blend of responsiveness and plushness. It's a well-balanced setup.
6832,135,7,7.5,2022-08-08,cushion,"The Low has the same Nitro foam setup as the mid-top version. It has a lot of impact protection while also offering some court feel. Once it gets broken in, the cushioning excels."
6833,135,293,8.0,2022-08-16,cushion,"The cushioning is soft and not clunky. It's not the best for court feel, but it makes up for it with impact protection."
6834,135,307,10.0,2022-08-08,materials,I found the materials were breathable while still being comfortable.
6835,135,33,9.0,2022-08-08,materials,"Similar to other modern basketball shoes, the materials are textiles. It's not the most breathable shoe, but it is comfortable."
6836,135,7,7.0,2022-08-08,materials,"The materials are the same as the mid-tops. The textiles are cheap, but the performance is solid."
6837,135,293,8.0,2022-08-16,materials,Materials are the same on the Lo vs the original. It's thin and supportive.
6838,135,307,10.0,2022-08-08,support,"The stability of the shoe is immaculate. My ankle felt stable, especially in a low-cut shoe."
6839,135,33,9.0,2022-08-08,support,The support will perform great for most.
6840,135,7,8.5,2022-08-08,support,"The internal heel counter locks you in very well, and the midsole materials help keep you contained laterally. Puma did a great job with the support features."
6841,135,293,8.0,2022-08-16,support,"Lateral stability and containment were not issues on the shoe, but I didn't enjoy the heel lockdown."
6842,135,33,9.0,2022-08-08,fit,"The shoe has no heel pillows, so players with narrow heels might have slippage issues. Otherwise, the fit does a good job of keeping you contained."
6843,135,7,8.5,2022-08-08,fit,"My toe goes right to the edge of the shoe, and cranking down the laces will help keep you locked in."
6844,135,293,8.0,2022-08-16,fit,"The fit is snug, but I enjoy that type of fit. I was also good to go length-wise."
6845,135,7,50.0,2022-08-08,outdoor,I think the outsole can perform well outdoors.
6846,135,293,50.0,2022-08-16,outdoor,The durability seems like it will be good.
6847,135,7,2,2022-08-08,width,Go up half a size if you have a wide foot. The shoe is narrow around the midfoot.
6848,135,293,2,2022-08-16,width,The width is slightly narrow.
6849,135,7,3,2022-08-08,size,The shoe does fit true to size.
6850,135,293,3,2022-08-16,size,I went true to size.
6851,136,365,9.5,2022-06-25,expert_overall,"The New Balance TWO WXY V2 provides a nearly flawless experience. Some players might prefer a bit more cushion, but I had no complaints. This shoe could be New Balance's best offering yet."
6852,136,1,8.4,2022-06-08,expert_overall,"The New Balance TWO WXY V2 is a fun shoe to play in, and it's a good shoe for players needing their feet to plant and grip in tight spaces such as under the rim."
6853,136,293,8.4,2022-06-25,expert_overall,"I really enjoyed playing in the New Balance TWO WXY V2. The traction is outstanding, and all other aspects of the shoe such as cushioning and support held their own."
6854,136,6,8.2,2022-06-16,expert_overall,I would say that the New Balance TWO WXY V2 is the best performer in New Balance's basketball lineup. Every performance aspect of the shoe is solid.
6855,136,7,8.2,2022-07-07,expert_overall,"The New Balance TWO WXT V2 is one of the best shoes available. It has one of the best traction setups I've ever played in, but be careful if you need a lot of lateral containment."
6856,136,309,7.9,2023-03-15,user_overall,"Let's just say, it's not a bad shoe. Traction is well above average with a strong bite and OK performance on dusty courts. But the worse part for me was the cushioning. The shoe plays low to the ground but there is little to no protection under the forefoot. Personally, this is the worst shoe for consistent running up and down the court. The fuelcell is just not the best for constant, fast movement or footwork. The shoe also doesn't offer much bounce and is probably best for grounded players."
6857,136,366,9.6,2022-07-24,user_overall,The new balance two wxy is the best performing shoe new balance has made yet and best I’ve seen in a long time it’s a good shoe for a player who needs traction four foot flex and responsiveness to play quick I definitely recommend this shoe for you

6861,136,365,10.0,2022-06-25,traction,This outsole does not disappoint. It'll cover you in every direction.
6862,136,1,9.0,2022-06-08,traction,The outsole tread is by far my favourite part of the shoe. The traction grips much harder than the previous shoe.
6863,136,293,10.0,2022-06-25,traction,"The traction is absolutely amazing. I didn't have to break it in, and they bit hard. This shoe has top-tier traction."
6864,136,6,9.0,2022-06-16,traction,"The traction on the shoe is really, really nice. It bites hard and feels tacky."
6865,136,7,10.0,2022-07-07,traction,I had no issues with the traction. I didn't need to wipe them either. It's one of the best tractions I've ever tested.
6866,136,365,9.5,2022-06-25,cushion,The shoe rides low to the ground and offers an acceptable amount of impact protection.
6867,136,1,8.0,2022-06-08,cushion,The midsole is made entirely of FuelCell and encases the Abzorb heel puck. It offers a lot of energy absorption but not so much energy return.
6868,136,293,8.0,2022-06-25,cushion,"The cushioning setup surprised me. It's extremely low-to-the-ground, so the court feel is awesome. The impact protection is also better than expected."
6869,136,6,8.0,2022-06-16,cushion,"The FuelCell feels good. The cushion offers impact protection in the heel, but the forefoot is thin."
6870,136,7,7.5,2022-07-07,cushion,"The forefoot is low to the ground and doesn't offer much impact protection. The heel section does offer some impact protection, though."
6871,136,365,9.5,2022-06-25,materials,I thoroughly enjoyed the flexibility and next to no break-in time that the FitWeave Lite upper provides.
6872,136,1,9.0,2022-06-08,materials,"The materials are smooth, padded, and comfortable. The upper allows for a flowing style of movement with few restrictions."
6873,136,293,8.0,2022-06-25,materials,The upper feels nice and is comfortable on foot. The materials conformed nicely to my feet. The only downside is that the quality isn't the best.
6874,136,6,8.0,2022-06-16,materials,"The materials aren't the most premium feeling, but they more than get the job done. I can't complain, considering the price."
6875,136,7,8.5,2022-07-07,materials,New Balance uses Fit Weave Lite for the materials. It's lightweight and breathable. I like the setup.
6876,136,365,9.0,2022-06-25,support,"Overall, my experience with the support was positive. I just wish that the torsional bar was more beefed up."
6877,136,1,8.0,2022-06-08,support,"The lockdown of the laces is good, and the materials help keep you secure."
6878,136,293,8.0,2022-06-25,support,"The support is adequate but could be better. I had no issues, though."
6879,136,6,8.0,2022-06-16,support,I didn't have any issues with the support.
6880,136,7,6.0,2022-07-07,support,"Once you crank the laces down, the heel lockdown is solid. However, I did experience issues with lateral containment and staying on the footbed."
6881,136,365,9.5,2022-06-25,fit,"I had no issues with the fit, thanks to the materials. Just make sure you lace up tight."
6882,136,1,8.0,2022-06-08,fit,The upper of the shoe locks you into a more snug fit.
6883,136,293,8.0,2022-06-25,fit,"The fit is snug, but the materials, especially in the toe box, stretch out the more you wear them."
6884,136,6,8.0,2022-06-16,fit,"The upper fit is snug and locked down, but the materials provide padding and cushioning, making the shoe feel comfortable."
6885,136,7,9.0,2022-07-07,fit,"I enjoyed the fit of the shoe. There wasn't much movement inside the shoe, which I prefer."
6886,136,1,50.0,2022-06-08,outdoor,The rubber is hard but thin.
6887,136,293,50.0,2022-06-25,outdoor,"The grooves are thin, but the rubber is hard."
6888,136,7,0.0,2022-07-07,outdoor,The rubber compound doesn't look like it will hold up outdoors.
6889,136,293,2,2022-06-25,width,The shoe is slightly narrow.
6890,136,6,3,2022-06-16,width,"If your foot is wide, I recommend going half a size up."
6891,136,7,2,2022-07-07,width,Go up half a size if you have a wide foot.
6892,136,1,3,2022-06-08,size,People with narrow and medium-shaped feet can go true to size.
6893,136,293,3,2022-06-25,size,"I went true to size, and it fits me well."
6894,136,6,3,2022-06-16,size,The TWO WXY V2 does run true to size.
6895,136,7,3,2022-07-07,size,I'm going to say they fit true to size.
6896,137,307,8.6,2022-07-07,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 2 is an excellent basketball shoe. I was balanced and supported the whole time. They weren't the most breathable and are a bit heavy, though."
6897,137,33,8.5,2022-08-04,expert_overall,"There's not much to complain about with the Jordan Zion 2. It's a low-to-the-ground, supportive basketball shoe with one of the best tractions available."
6898,137,7,8.5,2022-11-12,expert_overall,The Jordan Zion 2 has some of the best materials on a signature shoe to go along with being the most supportive shoe on the market.
6899,137,2,8.4,2022-06-25,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 2 has a better traction and cushion setup than the Zion 1, which makes this a great shoe to play in."
6900,137,1,8.4,2022-07-01,expert_overall,The Jordan Zion 2 is a solid shoe for players that like to operate in the paint and utilize lateral movement to their advantage. They are probably the best shoe for sturdy post players.
6901,137,293,8.4,2022-07-26,expert_overall,"I had a very good time playing in the Jordan Zion 2. The shoe offers a lot of support, and I was impressed with the cushioning and traction setup."
6902,137,6,8.2,2022-08-04,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 2 is an upgrade from the Jordan Zion 1. The traction is good, the cushion feels nice, and the support is there."
6903,137,112,8.0,2022-07-26,expert_overall,"If you can try the Jordan Zion 2 on for size first, I'd recommend it as a performance basketball shoe. Just make sure that the Achilles pillows don't feel uncomfortable for you."
6904,137,32,7.5,2022-07-07,expert_overall,"In my opinion, the Jordan Zion 2 is worse than last year's model. The traction is decent, and the support was great. However, I didn't like the materials and cushioning was mediocre."
6905,137,116,8.6,2024-01-10,user_overall,The most versatile sneaker I'v
6906,137,224,8.6,2022-11-02,user_overall,"I liked it, at first the materials were bad, but when you break it in they get really good, the traction is pretty good,  but when you are wearing this for a long time your feet might hurt a little but is not a big deal, the cushion and support are both amazing, it's a better option for big guys but you can also do good with them as a guard. Now I have these shoes for about 2-3 months and they are holding up great playing manly outdoors, and after broken in they feel kinda minimal tbh."
6907,137,368,9.2,2022-10-27,user_overall,"I play only on an outdoor court and I gotta say this shoe was worth every penny. After almost 2 months of everyday use the shoe is holding up pretty well. Most of the outsole is still intact except for a really small line in the forefoot area that doesn't really affect that much of the performance. Cushion is great, I can easily play +3 hours straight and don't feel any considerable foot pain. I have to say that you need to break the shoe in before taking an opinion on this shoe."
6908,137,294,8.0,2023-10-13,user_overall,"Possibly the best option offered by Jordan and Nike for outdoor play in recent years, decent traction and perfect cushioning for playing on cement and highly recommended for indoor positions, although as a perimeter player I have not noticed a pair with a lot of cushioning They support the foot very well, although they get tight on the toes when you've been playing for a while. The velcro honestly doesn't adjust the foot at all."
6909,137,369,9.0,2022-10-11,user_overall,Once you slightly break in the shoes takes about 2 or 3 wears the pads and whole shoe form to your foot. Extremely comfortable and top tier traction. It also provide amazing sport while not feeling heavy. The air strobel unit in the heel with the zoom air up front provide amazing bounce. For the price one of then if not the best shoe.
6910,137,307,9.0,2022-07-07,traction,The traction surprised me by performing better than expected.
6911,137,33,9.5,2022-08-04,traction,"The traction is the best aspect of the Zion 2. After breaking them in for an hour, they performed like one of the best traction patterns on the market."
6912,137,7,7.5,2022-11-12,traction,"You won't have any issues playing on clean courts, but make sure to wipe on dusty courts."
6913,137,2,9.0,2022-06-25,traction,The traction is a huge upgrade on the Zion 2. This setup is one of the best from Jordan Brand.
6914,137,1,8.0,2022-07-01,traction,The traction performs really well when you're going side-to-side and making lateral cuts.
6915,137,293,9.0,2022-07-26,traction,"I was surprised with how well the traction performed. It's fantastic, especially on clean courts."
6916,137,6,8.0,2022-08-04,traction,"The traction performs pretty well. It bites on clean courts, but you need to wipe for dustier courts."
6917,137,112,8.0,2022-07-26,traction,I had no issues with the traction.
6918,137,32,8.0,2022-07-07,traction,"I would say the traction on a clean court is decent, but it isn't good on dusty courts. They excel when making lateral movements."
6919,137,307,9.0,2022-07-07,cushion,I feel balanced when I elevate in these shoes. There were no issues with the cushioning for me.
6920,137,33,8.5,2022-08-04,cushion,"The Zion 2 isn't as plush as last year's model. The heel provides plenty of impact protection, but the forefoot is lower to the ground than expected."
6921,137,7,8.0,2022-11-12,cushion,I enjoyed the cushioning setup. The shoe felt soft and comfortable right out of the box. There's impact protection in the heel and springiness in the forefoot.
6922,137,2,8.0,2022-06-25,cushion,The cushion setup feels better in the Zion 2 than the Zion 1. It feels lower to the ground and more responsive. There's also plenty of impact protection under the heel.
6923,137,1,8.0,2022-07-01,cushion,"The Air Strobel unit and shank only go to the midfoot, so the priority is on the heel. The Phylon does feel soft, and I felt like I was getting a lot of bounce out of the shoe."
6924,137,293,9.0,2022-07-26,cushion,"This shoe has been one of my favourite cushioning setups recently. You feel low-to-the-ground, and it has a lot of bounce. The foam is also soft."
6925,137,6,9.0,2022-08-04,cushion,"An Air Strobel in the back and a forefoot Zoom unit combine to offer impact protection, bounce, and responsiveness."
6926,137,112,8.0,2022-07-26,cushion,"I have a love/hate relationship with the cushioning setup. The back half of the shoe uses an Air Strobel on half of the shoe. I loved the back half. I can feel the forefoot Zoom unit, but it could be much better."
6927,137,32,6.0,2022-07-07,cushion,I was very disappointed with the cushioning. It bottomed out too quickly. It's firm and does offer decent responsiveness.
6928,137,307,8.0,2022-07-07,materials,"I didn't like how the shoe felt initially, but after breaking them in, it felt pretty good."
6929,137,33,7.5,2022-08-04,materials,Mesh and synthetics make up most of the shoe. The materials feel cheap but don't hinder performance.
6930,137,7,9.5,2022-11-12,materials,"I love what Jordan Brand did with the materials of the shoe. The suede feels soft, and the whole shoe feels breathable."
6931,137,2,8.0,2022-06-25,materials,The materials are relatively thin but perform well. The shoe doesn't feel as bulky as it looks.
6932,137,1,9.0,2022-07-01,materials,There are lots of panelling elements on the upper that work well to assist the fit and support.
6933,137,293,8.0,2022-07-26,materials,"On the forefoot, we have mesh. It's not bad and feels soft. Most materials on the shoe are synthetic. It doesn't feel stiff or cumbersome, though."
6934,137,6,8.0,2022-08-04,materials,"The mesh material could be of better quality, but it doesn't feel too cheap. The heel area, however, does feel cheap. Performance isn't affected, though."
6935,137,112,8.0,2022-07-26,materials,There's tons of mesh and synthetic leather on the sneaker. It's a comfortable shoe.
6936,137,32,6.0,2022-07-07,materials,"Personally, I don't like the materials on the Zion 2. It's not breathable and it's stiff instead of flexible."
6937,137,307,9.0,2022-07-07,support,One of the best features of the shoe is the ankle support. The shoe is also very stable.
6938,137,33,8.5,2022-08-04,support,"These shoes' support features fit Zion's play style perfectly. They're stable, wide, and balanced."
6939,137,7,10.0,2022-11-12,support,"I think this is the most supportive basketball shoe on the market. The heel counter is rigid, and the velcro strap helps keep you secure."
6940,137,2,9.0,2022-06-25,support,The large heel cup provides extra support around your ankle. The lacing system and strap also work to lock you down well.
6941,137,1,9.0,2022-07-01,support,"The forefoot strap helps you dial in the amount of support you get towards the front of the shoe. The containment is also phenomenal, and the heel counter is the thickest I've ever seen."
6942,137,293,9.0,2022-07-26,support,"The forefoot strap doesn't do much, but the rest of the shoe provides plenty of support. This shoe is one of the more supportive shoes that you can get."
6943,137,6,8.0,2022-08-04,support,"I had no issues with the support. The internal heel counter keeps you contained, and the materials kept me from sliding laterally."
6944,137,112,8.0,2022-07-26,support,"Heel slip-in comfort is probably my biggest gripe with the shoe, but the rest of the shoe is plenty supportive. The strap doesn't do much, but I liked that Jordan Brand included it."
6945,137,32,8.0,2022-07-07,support,The ankle pillows in the heel area caused me a lot of discomfort even after breaking them in. The strap does a good job of locking down your foot.
6946,137,307,8.0,2022-07-07,fit,The shoe fit more snugly than I would've liked.
6947,137,33,8.5,2022-08-04,fit,"The forefoot strap works well to help dial in the fit. Length-wise, the shoe is perfect too."
6948,137,7,7.5,2022-11-12,fit,"The only gripe I have with the fit is in the heel area. The collar rubbed against my heel, and it needed to break in."
6949,137,2,8.0,2022-06-25,fit,The forefoot strap provides extra customizability to allow you to get the right fit. The shoe offers a great fit overall.
6950,137,1,8.0,2022-07-01,fit,The strap worked to help customize the fit of the shoe. The first few runs could cause issues around the ankle until the shoe breaks in.
6951,137,293,7.0,2022-07-26,fit,"The narrowness of the forefoot caused some pain on the outside of my foot, but it got better the more I played in the shoe."
6952,137,6,8.0,2022-08-04,fit,"The overlays on the forefoot can cause some pinching pain. Besides that, the fit was solid for me."
6953,137,32,8.0,2022-07-07,fit,"The fit starts out snug, but after breaking the shoe in, they become a more regular fit."
6954,137,7,100.0,2022-11-12,outdoor,I think these shoes are good to use outdoors.
6955,137,1,100.0,2022-07-01,outdoor,"The rubber on the outsole is hard, which is impressive."
6956,137,293,0.0,2022-07-26,outdoor,It probably isn't the best option for outdoor play.
6957,137,6,0.0,2022-08-04,outdoor,I do not think this outsole will last outdoors.
6958,137,7,3,2022-11-12,width,"In my opinion, the shoe is wide-foot friendly."
6959,137,2,2,2022-06-25,width,Go half a size up if you have a wide foot.
6960,137,1,2,2022-07-01,width,Wide footers should go up half a size.
6961,137,293,2,2022-07-26,width,"The shoe is narrow, and I felt some pinching on my pinky toe."
6962,137,6,3,2022-08-04,width,I have slightly wide feet and felt some pressure on the outside of my forefoot. You can consider going up half a size if you have wide feet.
6963,137,7,3,2022-11-12,size,I would go true to size.
6964,137,2,3,2022-06-25,size,Go true to size if you have a regular foot shape.
6965,137,1,3,2022-07-01,size,"The shoe is a bit hard to get on, but going true to size should work for most people."
6966,137,293,3,2022-07-26,size,"I went true to size, and the shoe fits me well."
6967,137,6,3,2022-08-04,size,Going true to size is everyone's best bet.
6968,138,7,9.5,2022-07-01,expert_overall,"I preferred playing in the Jordan 36 Low a bit more than the Jordan 36. It's a lightweight, breathable shoe that offers bouncy cushion and grippy traction."
6969,138,293,9.3,2022-07-01,expert_overall,"The Jordan 36 Low performs almost identically to the Jordan 36. It comes down to personal preference, and I like a low-top shoe better."
6970,138,1,9.0,2022-07-01,expert_overall,"The Jordan 36 Low is almost identical to the regular Jordan 36. The main difference is the Lows are not as supportive, but it has a more comfortable fit."
6971,138,6,9.0,2022-07-01,expert_overall,"The Jordan 36 Low is a must-buy for most players. I can't recommend it enough, especially for the price. It's comfortable, the traction is great, and the cushion is outstanding."
6972,138,311,9.1,2022-10-01,user_overall,"Just buy it if you find it at lower than retail, amazing for all positions, no outdoor in these cuz it is a hella expensive shoe and durability is not good and if you are a fucking pig in terms of smelly feet these have very good ventilation cuz the materials. Traction and Cushion are ok(traction was ass tho idk how but It was)The cushion was so nice that it was too much for me. If you are a shifty lightweight PG or SG I would stick to the PG 6, Giannis immortality, Don ISSUE 4, PG 5 or Dame"
6973,138,214,9.0,2023-03-31,user_overall,"This shoe is amazing in just about every way. You feel a bit unstable at first while you get used the the protruded zoom air unit on the bottom of the sole. When lacing up, it sometimes feels like you can’t quite get them tight enough, but I have never experienced any lockdown issues. The biggest issue of this shoe is that it is a pinky toe killer, even after extended break in time. If you go up half a size to avoid it, the fit feels too loose. Highly recommend putting bandaids to prevent."

6975,138,145,7.8,2024-01-13,user_overall,"This shoe is a pretty nice shoe, traction isn’t great but not bad, cushion is nice, it feels a bit of balance certain times. When u buy the shoe is a pinky toe KILLER. It rubs so much that I can’t play in them for more than 10 mins it took me weeks of nonstop play to make it not hurt as much but still can’t play for a good amount of time. The looks are great tho way better in hand than the photos. Materials are super lightweight and breathable. Overall alright shoe."

6977,138,7,9.5,2022-07-01,traction,"It's the exact same outsole pattern, but with a solid rubber compound.  I found this performed better than the translucent pairs."
6978,138,293,10.0,2022-07-01,traction,The outsole pattern provides an amazing bite. It plays well on both clean and dusty courts.
6979,138,1,9.0,2022-07-01,traction,Both the mid and the low outsoles are identical. It performs fantastically.
6980,138,6,10.0,2022-07-01,traction,The traction pattern is exactly the same as the Jordan 36. The performance is almost identical. The only difference is that the solid rubber doesn't pick up as much dust.
6981,138,7,9.5,2022-07-01,cushion,"The cushioning is the exact same on the 36 Low as the 36. For me, it's the perfect cushion setup."
6982,138,293,9.0,2022-07-01,cushion,The cushioning offers a good court feel while delivering bounce and impact protection. It's a strong setup.
6983,138,1,10.0,2022-07-01,cushion,The cushioning is also the exact same from the low to the mid. The Zoom Strobel unit remains plush and comfortable. The protruding Zoom Air unit underneath the forefoot also provides tons of bounce.
6984,138,6,10.0,2022-07-01,cushion,The cushion setup is also identical to the 36. It feels amazing. It's very bouncy with a lot of impact protection.
6985,138,7,10.0,2022-07-01,materials,The upper provides strength and breathability while still being lightweight.
6986,138,293,9.5,2022-07-01,materials,"The materials are the same as the highs, but the fuse rises higher on the shoe than in the high-top version."
6987,138,1,8.0,2022-07-01,materials,"The materials used on the upper are slightly different, and because of this, they aren't as containing. They are just as durable, though."
6988,138,6,8.0,2022-07-01,materials,"The 36 Low still uses a Leno-weave upper combined with a fuse for support and durability. The quality isn't the best, but the performance is solid."
6989,138,7,9.5,2022-07-01,support,I find the 36 Low to be a very supportive shoe. The Phylon midsole cages your foot to provide lateral containment.
6990,138,293,9.0,2022-07-01,support,"Lateral containment was good. The added fuse provides some more support, but it's only a minor improvement on an already good setup."
6991,138,1,8.0,2022-07-01,support,"The material used on the low is slightly different, meaning the shoe is not as good at containing your foot as the mid version."
6992,138,6,9.0,2022-07-01,support,"The support is almost the same as the Jordan 36. The Low version gave me a bit more heel slippage. It didn't feel like it would slip off, but I was mentally aware of the slipping."
6993,138,7,9.0,2022-07-01,fit,"The shoe can fit narrow, but it otherwise has a 1-to-1 fit."
6994,138,293,9.0,2022-07-01,fit,"The fit is consistent with the original release of the shoe. It's very snug, which I enjoy."
6995,138,1,10.0,2022-07-01,fit,The fit is better on the 36 Low as it feels more comfortable on foot.
6996,138,6,8.0,2022-07-01,fit,The fit is identical to the regular Jordan 36.
6997,138,7,50.0,2022-07-01,outdoor,"The 36 Low holds up better durability-wise, but I still wouldn't take these outdoors."
6998,138,293,0.0,2022-07-01,outdoor,The grooves are really thin and the rubber is soft. I wouldn't recommend taking these outdoors.
6999,138,1,0.0,2022-07-01,outdoor,"The rubber is hard, but the grooves are too thin to be durable outdoors."
7000,138,293,2,2022-07-01,width,The shot fits narrow.
7001,138,1,3,2022-07-01,width,The Lows accommodate wide feet well.
7002,138,6,2,2022-07-01,width,The shoe is slightly narrow.
7003,138,293,3,2022-07-01,size,I was good going true to size.
7004,138,1,3,2022-07-01,size,I'd recommend going true to size.
7005,138,6,3,2022-07-01,size,I went true to size and had no issues.
7006,139,1,8.8,2022-08-16,expert_overall,"The Under Armour Curry 4 FloTro features some of the tackiest traction on the market. It's a shoe meant for players who utilize footwork and movement, so they may not be the best for more explosive players."
7007,139,293,8.6,2022-07-26,expert_overall,"The Curry 4 FloTro provides amazing performance for the price. The materials are comfortable, and the traction is outstanding. This shoe will definitely be in my rotation."
7008,139,6,8.6,2022-08-16,expert_overall,The Curry 4 FloTro is a solid pickup. It's similar to the Curry 8 and 9 with fantastic traction. The only potential downside is the lack of impact protection.
7009,139,3,8.6,2023-05-04,expert_overall,A very impressive traction and cushion setup carries the Curry 4 FloTro. It's a great performer. Just be careful with sudden lateral cuts and stops.
7010,139,192,10.0,2024-03-16,user_overall,"I got these as my first-ever flotro from Under Amour's Curry Brand. I believe this model was released in the midst of the 2022 finals between the Celtics and the Warriors. And to celebrate Golden State's victory over Boston, I got myself the ""Pi Day"" colorway of this model. It did not disappoint me in terms of performance, in fact it was the perfect high top shoe for me. At the time it became my favorite Under Armour Curry Model."
7011,139,372,9.7,2022-08-21,user_overall,"Its the best high top shoe for 2022 with outstanding traction.Under armour made Curry's favourite shoe improved and better than ever for me it might be the best ua shoe of 2022,its between this and futr x e24 model.I would recommend this shoe for every hooper."
7012,139,373,9.7,2022-08-11,user_overall,It is a big step up from curry 4 og. Great cushion wit
7013,139,374,8.9,2022-08-11,user_overall,"I really like the materials and it fit like a glove. I went up a half size and have played in them once. They are very grippy and durable. I did not like that it was kade out of suede, but it held fairly outdoors."
7014,139,375,7.0,2022-08-22,user_overall,!!WARNING!! I had very bad blisters after wearing them the Achilles pad is too low and too hard. Also the material is very uncomfortable. Amazing traction and looks. But lacking in cushion as well.
7015,139,1,10.0,2022-08-16,traction,The traction is a lot tackier than previous Under Armour shoes that use the Flow compound.
7016,139,293,10.0,2022-07-26,traction,"The traction pattern is exactly the same as the Curry 8, and it performs phenomenally. It stops hard and quick."
7017,139,6,10.0,2022-08-16,traction,"The traction pattern is the same as the Curry 9. The performance on clean courts is the same, but on dusty courts, the Curry 4 FloTro performed much better."
7018,139,3,10.0,2023-05-04,traction,The traction works. It's the last level of performance as the newer Curry models.
7019,139,1,9.0,2022-08-16,cushion,"The midsole is still Flow cushioning, but the shank is stiffer in the FloTro 4. It's more stable but less explosive. The cushioning is also flatter and offers more court feel and less tilt."
7020,139,293,8.0,2022-07-26,cushion,"This shoe is great if you're looking for something low to the ground and responsive. There isn't a significant amount of bounce and compression, though."
7021,139,6,8.0,2022-08-16,cushion,The Flow cushioning is low-to-the-ground with a lot of court feel. It's a smooth-feeling cushion.
7022,139,3,9.0,2023-05-04,cushion,The cushioning is excellent. It feels fluid.
7023,139,1,8.0,2022-08-16,materials,"The shoe's construction is accommodating and will work with ankle braces well. It also offers a lot of feedback on how your foot feels within the shoe. However, the panelling is less durable than the materials on the Curry 9."
7024,139,293,9.0,2022-07-26,materials,"The suede material is quite nice. It's not the best quality, but it's softer than I expected."
7025,139,6,9.0,2022-08-16,materials,The materials are thick and feel high quality. It feels nice on foot.
7026,139,3,8.0,2023-05-04,materials,The suede upper feels nice in hand. The shoe is lightweight and minimal.
7027,139,1,8.0,2022-08-16,support,"The midsole and upper work together to keep your foot stable through pivots and sharp movements. My only concern is the upper panelling is soft, and repeated wear can cause tearing."
7028,139,293,8.0,2022-07-26,support,"This material is damn supportive. I was good to go for lateral containment. Bigger players should be cautious, though. I also experienced some minor heel slippage."
7029,139,6,8.0,2022-08-16,support,"My heel felt locked in, but I felt my foot sliding on the footbed when I made harder lateral movements. It wasn't too concerning, though."
7030,139,3,7.0,2023-05-04,support,The upper could be sturdier. The traction works so well that I sometimes felt I might roll over.
7031,139,1,9.0,2022-08-16,fit,The fit is more accommodating for players with wider feet. The shoe doesn't taper towards the mid and forefoot areas.
7032,139,293,8.0,2022-07-26,fit,"It fits similar to the Curry 8, but it runs somewhat short. The toe box is also roomier than what I like in my performance shoes."
7033,139,6,8.0,2022-08-16,fit,I had no issues with the fit of the shoe. There were no problems with pinching or pressure.
7034,139,3,9.0,2023-05-04,fit,The fit feels improved compared to the Curry 9. The toe box space feels good. The elastic and sock liner stretch well.
7035,139,1,0.0,2022-08-16,outdoor,I don't recommend using these shoes outdoors.
7036,139,293,50.0,2022-07-26,outdoor,"It's not the best for outdoor use, but it's not terrible either."
7037,139,6,3,2022-08-16,width,You might want to go up half a size if you have wider feet.
7038,139,293,2,2022-07-26,size,"If you want a snug fit length-wise, go true to size. Otherwise, I suggest going up half a size."
7039,139,6,3,2022-08-16,size,"I went true to size, and I felt fine."
7040,139,3,3,2023-05-04,size,"I went half a size up, but most people can go true to size."
7041,140,293,7.6,2022-05-27,expert_overall,"The Under Armour HOVR Havoc 4 Clone is a great shoe for clean courts, but beware if you primarily play on dustier courts."
7042,140,6,7.4,2022-05-27,expert_overall,The Under Armour HOVR Havoc 4 Clone is not a shoe I can recommend because of issues I had with the support. Everything else was pretty good. The shoe could've been much better with improved materials.
7043,140,293,7.0,2022-05-27,traction,"On a clear court, you're going to be good to go. In a dirtier setting, the shoe picks up dust quickly and hinders performance."
7044,140,6,8.0,2022-05-27,traction,"Overall, the traction is pretty good. You won't have issues playing on clean courts. I did have the occasional sliding movements on dirtier courts, though."
7045,140,293,8.0,2022-05-27,cushion,The mixture of Hovr and Mirco G is a combination that I enjoyed. The midsole felt softer than other Under Armour shoes while still providing court feel.
7046,140,6,7.0,2022-05-27,cushion,"Under Armour uses both Mirco G and Hovr cushioning on this model. The impact protection is decent, but the shoe is better for court feel and responsiveness."
7047,140,293,7.0,2022-05-27,materials,"The Clone upper feels like synthetic leather with a stitch pattern. It feels comfortable without feeling bulky. However, the quality isn't the best."
7048,140,6,7.0,2022-05-27,materials,"The materials are what Under Armour is calling Clone. It feels like synthetic leather. In my opinion, it's not the best, and it feels somewhat cheap."
7049,140,293,8.0,2022-05-27,support,I had no issues with the support and lockdown of the shoe. Lateral stability and containment were solid for me.
7050,140,6,6.0,2022-05-27,support,"There were no issues with heel support, but I did feel my foot sliding off the footbed. The materials didn't contain my foot laterally."
7051,140,293,8.0,2022-05-27,fit,"The shoe fits just how I like. There isn't much room in terms of toe box space, which I like."
7052,140,6,9.0,2022-05-27,fit,"The materials lie nicely over the foot. There is also no dead space in the toe box, and the shoe conforms to your foot nicely."
7053,140,293,50.0,2022-05-27,outdoor,"The shoe has relatively hard rubber, so it should be fine outdoors."
7054,140,6,3,2022-05-27,width,You may want to go up a half size if you have really wide feet.
7055,140,6,3,2022-05-27,size,I felt perfectly fine going true to size.
7056,141,6,7.8,2022-05-31,expert_overall,"For its price, the Nike Renew Elevate 3 is a solid performer. My only gripe with the shoe is the cushion. The shoe can be played indoors and outdoors without issues."
7057,141,293,7.4,2022-07-26,expert_overall,"I liked the Nike Renew Elevate 3, but I wouldn't say it's a top-tier performer. It's a great option if you're looking for a budget shoe."
7058,141,1,7.2,2022-06-16,expert_overall,"The Nike Renew Elevate 3 is a shifty shoe that's also fast in a straight line. The lateral containment also isn't the best. This shoe is a solid pickup for low-to-the-ground players, though."
7059,141,23,7.0,2022-06-04,expert_overall,The Nike Renew Elevate 3 will not disappoint you for the price. You can use it as a go-to budget-friendly outdoor hoop shoe.

7066,141,293,8.0,2022-07-26,traction,"At first, the traction does not bite hard. After breaking the shoe in, it performs well on a clean court."
7067,141,1,8.0,2022-06-16,traction,I really liked the outsole tread. It provides an opportunity to grip many different surfaces.
7068,141,23,8.0,2022-06-04,traction,The traction is the shoe's best feature.
7069,141,6,7.0,2022-05-31,cushion,"The cushion feels good in the heel. In the forefoot, the cushioning feels dead."
7070,141,293,7.0,2022-07-26,cushion,The cushioning doesn't compare to previous versions. It doesn't have a lot of impact protection or compression.
7071,141,1,7.0,2022-06-16,cushion,"The midsole pleasantly surprised me. The full-length Renew foam isn't the bounciest, but the midfoot shank does help provide some snap."
7072,141,23,7.0,2022-06-04,cushion,"The cushion is nothing amazing but serviceable. The Renew foam is thickest in the heel, and that's where it's felt most."
7073,141,6,8.0,2022-05-31,materials,"The mesh upper is decent, especially for the price."
7074,141,293,8.0,2022-07-26,materials,The textile mesh materials are super thin and conform to your foot well. I like how soft and comfortable it feels.
7075,141,1,7.0,2022-06-16,materials,"The upper is padded and comfortable, but the materials aren't premium. It is durable, though."
7076,141,23,6.0,2022-06-04,materials,"The materials are easily the worst part of the shoe. The shoe doesn't feel bad, but when you're playing, the upper turns out to be too forgiving."
7077,141,6,8.0,2022-05-31,support,I had zero issues with the support in the shoe. I had no problems with lateral containment either.
7078,141,293,7.0,2022-07-26,support,"I was good to go for lateral containment. The materials aren't the best for containing you during aggressive moves, though."
7079,141,1,6.0,2022-06-16,support,"I had issues with containment caused by the materials. The foam isn't too stable, so the shoe isn't the most laterally secure."
7080,141,23,7.0,2022-06-04,support,"The support works well enough but isn't anything special. There's no tipping because of the wide base, but the materials make it hard to contain your foot when you move with high torque."
7081,141,6,8.0,2022-05-31,fit,It was hard for me to slide my foot into the shoe because of how the shoe was built.
7082,141,293,7.0,2022-07-26,fit,"The shoe fits me well, but the materials stretch out over time. The toe box becomes roomier when the materials stretch, too."
7083,141,1,8.0,2022-06-16,fit,"The shoe shape is like a hot dog bun, but it accommodates narrow, medium, and wide-width feet well."
7084,141,23,7.0,2022-06-04,fit,"The Renew Elevate 3 fits slightly long, and the upper causes dead space in the toe box."
7085,141,293,100.0,2022-07-26,outdoor,"The rubber is hard, the grooves are deep, and it's a budget shoe. It'll be good for outdoor use."
7086,141,1,0.0,2022-06-16,outdoor,The rubber is soft.
7087,141,293,3,2022-07-26,width,I would say the shoe is around normal width.
7088,141,1,3,2022-06-16,width,The shoe accommodates most widths.
7089,141,293,3,2022-07-26,size,I went true to size.
7090,141,1,3,2022-06-16,size,Go true to size.
7091,142,307,8.8,2022-08-08,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie Low 5 might be my favourite shoe in the Kyrie lineup. Its traction, comfort, and support were fantastic for me. The only drawback is the breathability."
7092,142,23,8.5,2022-09-06,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie Low 5 is one of the best basketball shoes for lighter guards. It's an excellent performance shoe, but the lack of impact protection may not be the best for everyone."
7093,142,293,8.4,2022-05-09,expert_overall,"You'll feel quick and light on your feet in the Nike Kyrie Low 5. It does what every previous Kyrie Low model does, but it also features improved cushioning."
7094,142,19,8.2,2022-07-01,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie Low 5 offers incredible traction and a sturdy support setup. The cushion isn't the bounciest, but it is soft and comfortable."
7095,142,1,8.0,2022-04-28,expert_overall,"Overall, I liked the Nike Kyrie Low 5. It offers plenty of agility, traction, and support. I have no problem recommending these to players that rely heavily on footwork."
7096,142,6,8.0,2022-05-17,expert_overall,The Nike Kyrie Low 5 is a solid pickup for the price. The overall performance is a huge improvement from the previous Kyrie models.
7097,142,7,7.9,2022-09-22,expert_overall,"Shifty guards will enjoy the Nike Kyrie Low 5 the most. The cushion is somewhat lacking, but the shoe plays quickly and has strong traction."
7098,142,380,8.9,2022-06-27,user_overall,
7099,142,309,8.2,2023-03-15,user_overall,The kyrie low 5 is probably one of the best budget shoes I've ever tried and continues to be a great performer. The traction bites hard but not too hard right out of the box (the box is cool too) and works fine on dusty courts. The materials hold firm against consistent movement and I have not seen any tears or breaking points after three months (keep in mind that I only play indoors with these). I recommend this shoe to any guard (like myself) because it's light and easy to go from step to step
7100,142,381,8.4,2023-07-30,user_overall,"Hey, check out the Kyrie Low 5s – they're super cool! They look awesome with cool colors and patterns. When you wear them, you feel like a real bas"
7101,142,372,8.9,2022-07-10,user_overall,"All Kyrie's shoes are reliable and so it's Kyrie low 5.It has and amazing traction and it's super easy to wipe the dust,cushion is alright the same goes with the support and the fit.The materials don't feel premium but that ain't a problem for me.Its a very good shoe that comes in an affordable price 110 bucks.I recommend it for quick players who want a responsive shoe no matter the position.If u are a Kyrie fan or u like low top shoes with great traction go for it."
7102,142,39,8.6,2024-11-06,user_overall,"First thing I noticed was the traction, this is the best shoe I’ve ever worn traction wise it didn’t matter how dusty the court was, it would bite right through the dust. The cushion was a tiny problem as there was little impact protection but if your a lightweight guard you should be ok. Was pretty durable."
7103,142,307,10.0,2022-08-08,traction,"The traction is top-of-the-line, similar to other Kyrie shoes."
7104,142,23,9.0,2022-09-06,traction,"The traction is similar to the Kyrie 8, so you still get a great bite on the court. It's an excellent traction setup."
7105,142,293,10.0,2022-05-09,traction,"The pattern is similar to the Kyrie Infinity pattern, and it has a top-tier bite. It performs well on both clean and dusty surfaces."
7106,142,19,9.0,2022-07-01,traction,The traction works on all courts. It performed better than the Kyrie Infinity as well.
7107,142,1,9.0,2022-04-28,traction,I liked the tread on the Kyrie Low 5 more than the Kyrie Infinity. I found that I had a grip when making all types of movements.
7108,142,6,9.0,2022-05-17,traction,The traction is similar to the Kyrie Infinity traction pattern. It's insane on clean courts but does pick up some dust on dusty courts.
7109,142,7,9.5,2022-09-22,traction,The traction performs awesome on all courts. It's tacky and grippy.
7110,142,307,9.0,2022-08-08,cushion,This shoe is one of the most comfortable Kyrie shoes available.
7111,142,23,8.5,2022-09-06,cushion,The shoe features a rectangular Air Zoom unit under the forefoot and Cushlon in the rear. The main strengths are court feel and responsiveness
7112,142,293,8.0,2022-05-09,cushion,"The cushioning is actually quite nice. The court feel in this shoe felt very good. As for the foam, it bottoms out easily but still feels soft."
7113,142,19,8.0,2022-07-01,cushion,The cushioning in the shoe features Phylon foam and a rectangular Zoom unit underneath the forefoot. It feels soft underfoot and offers a good court feel.
7114,142,1,7.0,2022-04-28,cushion,"The cushion reminds me of the LeBron Witness 6. It has a harder, denser Phylon cushion with a narrow Zoom unit in the forefoot."
7115,142,6,8.0,2022-05-17,cushion,I think it's a full-length Phylon that provides adequate impact protection. The forefoot Zoom unit also gives the shoe some balance.
7116,142,7,7.0,2022-09-22,cushion,"The Phylon offers some compression in the heel, and the Zoom bag in the forefoot has a springy feeling. The impact protection could be better, though."
7117,142,307,8.0,2022-08-08,materials,"The shoe feels light, especially when making moves, but it isn't the most breathable."
7118,142,23,7.0,2022-09-06,materials,"The materials are also similar to the Kyrie 8, but the synthetic leather feels cheaper."
7119,142,293,8.0,2022-05-09,materials,"I really like the textile materials used on the shoe. It isn't the most premium, but it plays well."
7120,142,19,8.0,2022-07-01,materials,The materials feel comfortable but not as good as the Kyrie 8.
7121,142,1,8.0,2022-04-28,materials,The upper is just as sturdy as the Kyrie Infinity. The tongue and laces also feel great on foot.
7122,142,6,8.0,2022-05-17,materials,"The textile materials are also similar to the Kyrie Infinity. The difference is that the materials don't feel as premium on this model. It does perform well, though."
7123,142,7,8.0,2022-09-22,materials,"Mesh, textiles, and fuse materials are on the shoe. It's nothing special, but it works."
7124,142,307,9.0,2022-08-08,support,"My foot felt freer in this shoe, but I still had no issues with stability and support."
7125,142,23,9.0,2022-09-06,support,"The Kyrie Low 5 uses a two-point anchoring system instead of the four-point system on the Kyrie 8. It still gets the job done, and the support on the shoe is fantastic."
7126,142,293,8.0,2022-05-09,support,"The torsional support isn't the best, and it caused me some pain. However, when it came to lockdown, I had zero issues."
7127,142,19,8.0,2022-07-01,support,"I miss the added lace hole from the high-top Kyries, but the materials support you well."
7128,142,1,8.0,2022-04-28,support,The eyelets are reinforced and offer tremendous lockdown.
7129,142,6,8.0,2022-05-17,support,I didn't have any issues with support. The materials do a great job of keeping your foot planted on the footbed.
7130,142,7,7.0,2022-09-22,support,"The support of the shoe keeps you contained and locked in. The lacing system also helps to draw your foot into the shoe. There isn't much torsional support, though."
7131,142,307,8.0,2022-08-08,fit,I had no issues with the fit of the shoe.
7132,142,23,9.0,2022-09-06,fit,The shoe fits perfectly 1-to-1. It'll work great for players that enjoy a glove-like fit.
7133,142,293,8.0,2022-05-09,fit,The tongue and materials help to maintain a solid 1-to-1 fit. The only thing I didn't like was the extra room above the toe box.
7134,142,19,8.0,2022-07-01,fit,The shoe fits similarly to previous Kyrie models. It hugs your foot nicely.
7135,142,1,8.0,2022-04-28,fit,"The increased lockdown will help with the fit, but it can be a problem for anyone with a wider foot."
7136,142,6,7.0,2022-05-17,fit,I felt some pressure around the pinky toe area and the midfoot. I also experienced some dead space in the toe box area.
7137,142,7,8.0,2022-09-22,fit,"The shoe's fit is perfect if you enjoy a glove-like, true-to-size fit."
7138,142,307,100.0,2022-08-08,outdoor,I think this shoe will hold up outdoors.
7139,142,293,0.0,2022-05-09,outdoor,"The rubber is soft, and I don't think it will hold up outdoors."
7140,142,1,0.0,2022-04-28,outdoor,The rubber did not hold up well to the durability test.
7141,142,6,0.0,2022-05-17,outdoor,I wouldn't use these outdoors. The rubber is too soft.
7142,142,1,2,2022-04-28,width,These are not wide-fitting shoes by any means.
7143,142,6,2,2022-05-17,width,The shoe is definitely narrow.
7144,142,7,3,2022-09-22,width,The shoe accommodates wide feet decently well. I would still go half a size up if your foot is more than slightly wide.
7145,142,293,3,2022-05-09,size,"I went true to size. My toes reach the end of the shoe, which I like."
7146,142,1,3,2022-04-28,size,This shoe will fit well if you have a narrow or medium-shaped foot.
7147,142,6,3,2022-05-17,size,I would say the shoe fits true to size.
7148,142,7,3,2022-09-22,size,I went true to size.
7149,143,1,9.4,2022-06-02,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 15 has something for everybody. The cushion is outstanding, and the traction grips incredibly. The shoe also accommodates almost every type of foot shape."
7150,143,19,9.3,2022-06-16,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 15 could very well be the best basketball this year. The shoe has great cushion and traction, and the materials are solid."
7151,143,112,9.3,2022-07-07,expert_overall,"I would recommend the Nike KD 15 to any and everyone. The traction is amazing, and the cushion is incredibly comfortable."
7152,143,293,9.0,2022-06-11,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 15 is an amazing performer. The shoe feels responsive because the traction is so damn good, and the cushion is bouncy. The only downside is that my heel doesn't feel the most locked down."
7153,143,307,9.0,2022-07-07,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 15 is a magnificent shoe that I highly recommend. The traction is one of the best available, and the cushion is good to go right out of the box."
7154,143,32,9.0,2022-07-26,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 15 is almost a complete upgrade of the KD 14. The only downside is the heel slippage. Otherwise, the cushioning and traction are amazing."
7155,143,382,9.0,2022-07-26,expert_overall,"I enjoyed playing in the Nike KD 15 a lot. I would highly recommend them. The traction is grippy and perfect for indoors, and the Zoom Strobel unit is bouncy, as usual."
7156,143,7,8.7,2022-10-16,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 15 is one of my favourite basketball shoes. The cushioning, traction, and support are some of the best available."
7157,143,6,8.6,2022-07-26,expert_overall,"Overall, the Nike KD 15 feels fantastic on the court. It's fun to play in, and I definitely recommend it. The only downside is the minimal amount of heel slippage."
7158,143,354,9.0,2023-09-07,user_overall,"This is one of my favorite basketball shoes. It is extremely versatile and great for any position! The price of the shoe is also reasonable, and despite somewhat cheap materials the shoe is light and breathable. Despite somewhat generic features the shoe takes it's tech to the next level. It has a traction pattern typical for Nike but the shoe grips better than any other basketball shoe I've warm inside and outside. The traction also lasts a long time. The  Nike Zoom Air Tech is also phenomenal."
7159,143,317,9.0,2023-09-17,user_overall,"One of the best shoes ever for sure, the cushion is amazing and it is a very sleek shoe, it ""moves"" very well. By that I mean, it is a shoe that allows you to make change of directions, cuts etc. The traction is great as long as it is not an outdoor or dusty court, when I use them outdoor I slip A LOT, but indoors it is amazing. The fit is great tho there is some heel slippage but nothing insane. Arch support is very good. Overall, this is an amazing shoe but dont recommend them for outdoors."
7160,143,383,8.2,2023-08-14,user_overall,"A good performer, but I had many issues wearing them. It takes AGES to overall break in! Not breathable at all, cushioning is just average, it's not that bouncy, neither that shock absorbing nor a comfortable shoe, it has a flat and hard sole system, like an internal shank plate with no middle support so feet can't bend, that gave me plantar fasciitis and chin pain  every time I used them. Otherwise It's very responsive and close to the ground. Grip is outstanding! Materials are too hard."
7161,143,214,9.4,2023-03-31,user_overall,"The KD 15 is a great performer. Two major upgrades over the KD 14, one downgrade. The shank plate on the KD 14 was directly under the zoom strobel, and gave me arch pain. The 15 has an exposed shank plate between the midsole and outsole. No more arch pain! The midsole is also a little stiffer and feels more stable on hard cuts. The only downgrade is the heel lockdown. The KD 14 was rock solid in this area. The KD 15 has a little heel slippage, but that does go away as you break them in."
7162,143,76,9.0,2023-05-01,user_overall,"my favourite shoe, really comfortable with great traction, mid foot wings keep me contained, i experienced some heel slippage, maybe on the first day or two a lot but not much past that. full length zoom strobel with cushlon is a perfect mix of responsiveness, bounciness and comfort!! traction stops on a dime if you wipe, does pick up dust if on a slightly dusty court which sucks. If i wear this for too long (like 3+ hours) then the zoom strobel can hurt my foot, fatigue bacically."
7163,143,1,10.0,2022-06-02,traction,The traction is incredible on the KD 15.
7164,143,19,10.0,2022-06-16,traction,I didn't experience any slipping. The traction definitely performed very well.
7165,143,112,10.0,2022-07-07,traction,This traction sticks like glue to both clean and dusty courts. I had no issues whatsoever with the traction.
7166,143,293,10.0,2022-06-11,traction,"The traction is top-tier, and it performs exceptionally well."
7167,143,307,9.0,2022-07-07,traction,I can't say enough good things about the traction of this shoe.
7168,143,32,10.0,2022-07-26,traction,The traction on the KD 15 is top-tier. It's super grippy and it grabs the floor really well. The traction sticks like glue to clean and dirty courts.
7169,143,382,9.5,2022-07-26,traction,"The rubber is soft and tacky, and it does its job well. The traction has you covered in all directions."
7170,143,7,9.5,2022-10-16,traction,The multi-directional traction pattern performs amazingly on clean and dirty courts. It reminds me of the Kobe 9.
7171,143,6,9.0,2022-07-26,traction,"Overall, the traction is good. You'll have a strong bite on clean courts, but it does pick up dust on dirtier courts."
7172,143,1,10.0,2022-06-02,cushion,"The midsole is a full-length Zoom Strobel and Cushlon, and it feels amazing. The bottom-loaded shank does make the cushion more efficient, though."
7173,143,19,10.0,2022-06-16,cushion,"Even with the Zoom Strobel unit, the court feel is solid. The impact protection and cushion overall are bouncy. It's hard to find a shoe with a good combination of these attributes."
7174,143,112,10.0,2022-07-07,cushion,"The Cushlon is soft, and the Zoom Strobel feels great underfoot. The impact protection under the heel is phenomenal."
7175,143,293,9.0,2022-06-11,cushion,The full-length Zoom Strobel unit is bouncy and offers a lot of compression. Impact protection is terrific too.
7176,143,307,9.0,2022-07-07,cushion,The cushion feels soft and responsive straight out of the box. It's a very comfortable shoe.
7177,143,32,10.0,2022-07-26,cushion,"Cushlon and a full-length Zoom Strobel are superb. It's a great combination of responsiveness, impact protection, and comfort."
7178,143,382,9.5,2022-07-26,cushion,"When I first played in these shoes, they felt somewhat stiff. After breaking them in, they feel a lot smoother. I really liked the bounciness and responsiveness of the Zoom Strobel."
7179,143,7,9.0,2022-10-16,cushion,I prefer this year's cushioning setup in the KD lineup. It's responsive and has some court feel. This is the best implementation of full-length Zoom.
7180,143,6,9.0,2022-07-26,cushion,The foam is firmer on the 15 than the 14. The Zoom Strobel is still bouncy and explosive; it's just not as soft as the 14.
7181,143,1,9.0,2022-06-02,materials,One of the biggest upgrades from the KD 14 to the KD 15 is the ventilated tongue. The upper also appears to be much more durable.
7182,143,112,8.0,2022-07-07,materials,The shoe feels comfortable and minimal on foot. It feels similar to the KD 14.
7183,143,293,9.0,2022-06-11,materials,The materials on the shoe are soft and conform to your foot well. I had no issues with the materials.
7184,143,32,9.0,2022-07-26,materials,"The materials are similar to the KD 14, but it's lighter. It feels more comfortable and durable."
7185,143,382,8.5,2022-07-26,materials,The materials are a lot of different meshes and textiles. They get the job done and are comfy on foot.
7186,143,7,7.5,2022-10-16,materials,"The shoe doesn't have many premium materials, but I enjoyed the comfort."
7187,143,6,9.0,2022-07-26,materials,"The materials are simple, but the shoe performs well."
7188,143,1,9.0,2022-06-02,support,The TPU winglets on the side of the shoe work with the laces to provide a secure and contained support system. The heel cup also gives you better lockdown and comfort.
7189,143,19,8.0,2022-06-16,support,"As long as you tie your laces well, the lateral containment with the plastic cage helps. I did experience some heel slipping, but it went away when I wore cushioned socks."
7190,143,112,9.0,2022-07-07,support,"I did not experience any heel slippage when I played. The lockdown was solid for me, especially the plastic wings on the sides of the shoe."
7191,143,293,8.0,2022-06-11,support,"For support and lateral containment, I was good to go. The plastic cage helps to reinforce the lateral containment of the shoe. I did have some issues with my heel not feeling locked down, though."
7192,143,307,9.0,2022-07-07,support,"The ankle support really worked for me, and I had no issues with stability either."
7193,143,32,8.0,2022-07-26,support,The lockdown and support are good but could be better. I did experience heel slippage.
7194,143,382,9.0,2022-07-26,support,"Nike put a lot of features on the shoe to make it stable. I never felt insecure, but it does lack some arch support."
7195,143,7,9.0,2022-10-16,support,"After breaking the shoe in, I had no issues with the lockdown. The TPU wings also help pull your foot into the shoe."
7196,143,6,8.0,2022-07-26,support,"The plastic cage provides a lot of lateral containment and stability. However, I did experience a minimal amount of heel slippage in both shoes."
7197,143,1,9.0,2022-06-02,fit,The lacing system allows you to customize the fit to help you feel more secure.
7198,143,19,9.0,2022-06-16,fit,The KD 15 accommodates more foot shapes compared to previous models. The midsection is also not as tight as in previous models.
7199,143,293,9.0,2022-06-11,fit,"The shoe fits very snugly, and I like that type of fit."
7200,143,32,9.0,2022-07-26,fit,"It is snug right out of the box, but after some wear, they fit perfectly."
7201,143,382,8.5,2022-07-26,fit,The shoe is narrow and snug right out of the box. It took some extra time for me to break these in.
7202,143,7,8.5,2022-10-16,fit,"I didn't experience heel slip, but it wasn't the most secure fit. Eventually, the fit became better, and I had no issues. I enjoyed the fit."
7203,143,6,8.0,2022-07-26,fit,"Overall, the fit is solid. I have no complaints."
7204,143,1,0.0,2022-06-02,outdoor,The downside about the traction is that it is not durable enough for outdoor play.
7205,143,112,0.0,2022-07-07,outdoor,I wouldn't recommend these for outdoor play.
7206,143,293,0.0,2022-06-11,outdoor,This shoe is not a good option for outdoor play because of the soft rubber.
7207,143,382,0.0,2022-07-26,outdoor,I have concerns about the long-term durability.
7208,143,293,1,2022-06-11,width,KD shoes are always narrow.
7209,143,382,1,2022-07-26,width,"It's a narrow shoe, for sure."
7210,143,7,2,2022-10-16,width,The shoe feels narrow.
7211,143,6,2,2022-07-26,width,"It's narrow. I have a slightly wide foot, but it was still ok to play in these."
7212,143,293,3,2022-06-11,size,I went true to size.
7213,143,382,2,2022-07-26,size,I recommend going up half a size.
7214,143,7,3,2022-10-16,size,Go true to size.
7215,143,6,3,2022-07-26,size,The shoe is true to size.
7216,144,112,8.8,2022-04-03,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 19 Low plays better than the high-top version of the shoe. The cushion setup is one of my favourites, while the support and traction are improved."
7217,144,1,8.2,2022-03-22,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 19 Low is best for centers and forwards, and if I'm being honest, I think they perform better than the highs."
7218,144,293,8.2,2022-05-29,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 19 Low is a shoe that I enjoyed playing in. The impact protection is crazy, and the materials feel minimal."
7219,144,2,8.0,2022-03-22,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 19 Low feels nice, and the cushion setup is comfortable. The materials provide solid support and lockdown, but the traction could be better."
7220,144,6,8.0,2022-06-08,expert_overall,"For $160, the Nike LeBron 19 Low is a solid shoe. It offers a lot of impact protection but beware of dusty courts."
7221,144,224,8.8,2023-02-01,user_overall,"Yo for some reason this shoe just worked for me, I hear most people saying that the traction is inconsistent or need some break in time, but it just worked for me right out of the box, the cushion is amazing if you dont care about responsiveness or court feel, I liked the materials and the fit as well. The durability outdoors should be decent because the base of the ""crown"" is hard but the top is very soft, overall a pretty good performer"
7222,144,264,8.6,2023-04-04,user_overall,"The Lebron 19 low is a solid shoe and performs well, but I found the traction to be not that good. Other than that, it feels high, and doesn’t have good court feel but the materials and cushion and comfort was really good and I enjoyed it. It has crazy Impact protection and I would reccomend this for people who need cushion on shoes."
7223,144,384,9.0,2023-02-23,user_overall,"The Lebron 19 lows are amazing, and have decent traction and are bouncy. They fit nicely and only take about a day to break them in. They also are good on outdoor courts as they have held up for 2 years with no breaking and a minimally dusty bottom."
7224,144,29,9.0,2022-08-03,user_overall,"Lebron 19 low is TTS and more flush cushion, lower mid sole than lebron 19 high top. I think this is good for play and casual for both but you will not like play with this if you not prefer to play with fish cushion shoes."
7225,144,385,7.3,2022-11-13,user_overall,"picks up a lot of dust, but good feel to the court in some way still."
7226,144,112,8.0,2022-04-03,traction,The traction on this shoe played great for me. It outperformed my expectations.
7227,144,1,8.0,2022-03-22,traction,"The tread is similar to the highs. I found that the outsole works very well when gripping outdoors. Once they wear down, though, the traction starts to slide."
7228,144,293,8.0,2022-05-29,traction,"The traction is the same on the 19 Low as the mainline 19. It performed well for me on clean courts, but I did slide a bit on dusty courts."
7229,144,2,7.0,2022-03-22,traction,"The traction is alright; it's nothing spectacular. There's no slippage, but it doesn't bite as hard as I'd like."
7230,144,6,8.0,2022-06-08,traction,"The traction pattern is similar, if not identical, to the regular LeBron 19. The main difference is that the performance was better on the low version. It struggles on dusty courts, though."
7231,144,112,10.0,2022-04-03,cushion,This shoe might be the most comfortable shoe I've tested this year. The cushion set blends in perfectly with the Air setup.
7232,144,1,8.0,2022-03-22,cushion,"They aren't the nimblest shoes because of the massive amount of React underfoot. However, the shoe provides an explosive first step."
7233,144,293,8.0,2022-05-29,cushion,The Air unit in the heel provides lots of compression and impact protection. The React in the forefoot also feels nice. The only downside is that the shoe doesn't offer much court feel.
7234,144,2,9.0,2022-03-22,cushion,The Lows feature a full-length React midsole with an Air Max unit in the heel portion. I like the React foam on the 19 Lows because it isn't caged. It feels bouncy and offers solid impact protection.
7235,144,6,8.0,2022-06-08,cushion,A full-length React midsole and the Air unit at the back of the shoe provide a ton of impact protection. The only downside to this setup is that it's high off the ground.
7236,144,112,9.0,2022-04-03,materials,The heel slip-in comfort was phenomenal because of the materials. The materials were also very breathable; I didn't experience overheating whatsoever.
7237,144,1,8.0,2022-03-22,materials,"The sock liner on the low does a much better job of providing support than the highs. The materials are also durable, so they should last outdoors."
7238,144,293,9.0,2022-05-29,materials,The materials feel supportive and not too bulky. The shoe feels comfortable and minimal.
7239,144,2,8.0,2022-03-22,materials,The materials provide a lot of structure to the shoe. The only aspect that needs breaking in is the toe cap.
7240,144,6,8.0,2022-06-08,materials,Nike uses a combination of synthetic materials and meshes on the upper. It offers structure and rigidity while also feeling premium.
7241,144,112,8.0,2022-04-03,support,I had no issues with heel lockdown or support in this sneaker.
7242,144,1,8.0,2022-03-22,support,"One thing that stood out was that the laces don't work well. Other than the laces, the rest of the support on the shoe is solid."
7243,144,293,8.0,2022-05-29,support,"I had zero issues with support and lockdown. The materials are supportive, and my foot did not move along the footbed."
7244,144,2,8.0,2022-03-22,support,The mesh and structure used on this shoe do an excellent job of keeping you secure. Heel containment and lockdown were not an issue either.
7245,144,6,8.0,2022-06-08,support,I didn't have any issues with the support of the shoe. The materials do a great job of keeping you contained.
7246,144,1,9.0,2022-03-22,fit,The fit of the 19 Low was very accommodating.
7247,144,293,8.0,2022-05-29,fit,I really enjoyed the fit of the shoe. Some things to note are that the front half of the shoe is snug.
7248,144,2,8.0,2022-03-22,fit,The shoe is more accommodating than I was expecting. It has more space in the forefoot.
7249,144,6,8.0,2022-06-08,fit,"I liked the fit of the shoe. The materials lie nicely on your foot, and the padding is comfortable."
7250,144,1,50.0,2022-03-22,outdoor,The durability was better than expected.
7251,144,293,1,2022-05-29,width,The toe box and front of the shoe become really narrow.
7252,144,6,2,2022-06-08,width,The shoe is slightly narrow.
7253,144,293,3,2022-05-29,size,"I went true to size, and the shoe fits me extremely well. Players that prefer a roomier fit might want to go up a size."
7254,144,6,3,2022-06-08,size,I would say these shoes run true to size.
7255,145,1,8.6,2022-04-01,expert_overall,"Once I broke in the New Balance Kawhi 2, I really started to enjoy the stability, grip, and nimbleness that the shoe provides. I'd recommend this shoe for any larger players."
7256,145,19,8.5,2022-04-10,expert_overall,The New Balance Kawhi 2 is pretty damn good. There are no glaring flaws. I would definitely recommend this shoe to anyone looking for an all-around shoe.
7257,145,307,8.3,2022-06-06,expert_overall,"The New Balance Kawhi 2 is a great shoe for players that rely on footwork to give them advantages. The cushion feels low to the ground, and the traction is incredible."
7258,145,112,8.3,2022-04-03,expert_overall,"The New Balance Kawhi 2 is my first ever New Balance shoe, and I do not regret picking it up. If you have a stop-and-go, run-the-floor style of play, I'm sure you'll love this shoe."
7259,145,2,8.2,2022-03-29,expert_overall,The only downside of the New Balance Kawhi 2 is that I wish they kept the same cushion found on the Kawhi 1. Every other aspect of the shoe is on par or better than the previous model.
7260,145,6,8.2,2022-03-31,expert_overall,The New Balance Kawhi 2 is a solid performer for the price point. It's a step in the right direction for the Kawhi lineup but still isn't quite as good as the Omn1s.
7261,145,293,8.0,2022-04-12,expert_overall,"The New Balance Kawhi 2 is a solid shoe, but I wouldn't say it's my favourite. It's a lightweight, supportive, and minimal shoe."
7262,145,365,8.0,2022-06-06,expert_overall,The New Balance Kawhi 2 is not flashy but gets the job done. It's one of my preferred shoes to play in because of the balanced performance it provides.
7263,145,386,10.0,2022-05-15,user_overall,It had awesome traction and a good fuelcell cushioning.

7268,145,1,9.0,2022-04-01,traction,The outsole tread is my favourite part of the shoe. It grabs just about any surface.
7269,145,19,8.0,2022-04-10,traction,"The traction is pretty good. It picks up dust often, but it still performs."
7270,145,307,9.0,2022-06-06,traction,The shoe has incredible traction. I didn't have to wipe once.
7271,145,112,8.0,2022-04-03,traction,I had no issues with traction whatsoever.
7272,145,2,8.0,2022-03-29,traction,"The traction of the shoe was gripping nicely on clean and dusty courts. It does take a bit of break-in time, though."
7273,145,6,8.0,2022-03-31,traction,"The traction is, for the most part, pretty good. At first, you slide a bit, but it gets better as you break the shoe in."
7274,145,293,8.5,2022-04-12,traction,"You need to break in the traction, but after a couple of days, it performs damn well. It picks up dust easily, but it still performs as long as you wipe."
7275,145,365,8.0,2022-06-06,traction,"The traction provides lateral coverage for both sides of the court, and I barely needed to wipe."
7276,145,1,8.0,2022-04-01,cushion,The FuelCell provides energy absorption but isn't the best at energy return. It's an effectively engineered cushion.
7277,145,19,9.0,2022-04-10,cushion,The FuelCell is well constructed. The comfort is on point. This shoe has the perfect blend of court feel and impact protection.
7278,145,307,8.0,2022-06-06,cushion,"I feel low to the ground in this shoe. It's a good cushion for players that rely on footwork, such as their first step."
7279,145,112,8.0,2022-04-03,cushion,"The front half of the cushion is caged, so it isn't as comfortable as the back half, but I still liked it. I also enjoyed the impact protection in the heel."
7280,145,2,7.0,2022-03-29,cushion,"The FuelCell foam on the Kawhi 2 is thinner than the Kawhi 1. I enjoyed the setup, but I liked the Kawhi 1 setup better. It's a shoe that's low to the ground and responsive."
7281,145,6,8.0,2022-03-31,cushion,"The Kawhi features a partially caged, full-length FuelCell midsole. The cushioning feels better than the Kawhi 1 but not as good as the Omn1s. It still feels good and offers impact protection and responsiveness."
7282,145,293,7.0,2022-04-12,cushion,"FuelCell cushion is usually soft, has a lot of compressions, and provides a good amount of rebound. In the Kawhi 2, it felt caged to the point where it's stiff."
7283,145,365,7.0,2022-06-06,cushion,"The cushion feels average at best, but the shoe still provides impact protection and smooth transitions while feeling low to the ground."
7284,145,1,9.0,2022-04-01,materials,The materials are light and breathable. They also do a good job of adding to the performance.
7285,145,19,9.0,2022-04-10,materials,"The upper materials use what New Balance calls Fit Weave Lite. It keeps you secure in the shoe, and it feels damn good."
7286,145,307,8.0,2022-06-06,materials,"The materials feel light, and they did break in over time."
7287,145,112,9.0,2022-04-03,materials,The materials feel comfortable from a step-in perspective. It's comfortable and breathable for the most part. I love the materials.
7288,145,2,9.0,2022-03-29,materials,The upper is one of the biggest changes on the Kawhi 2. It's thin and light. I like the way that it feels.
7289,145,6,8.0,2022-03-31,materials,"New Balance uses a material called Fit Weave Lite. It's basically a textile, but it feels really good on foot. It also feels good to the touch."
7290,145,293,9.0,2022-04-12,materials,New Balance uses Fit Weave Lite throughout the entire upper. The materials feel soft and supportive. I love how minimal it feels.
7291,145,365,8.0,2022-06-06,materials,"I can't complain about the performance of the materials. The Fitweave Lite upper is supportive, and the break-in time is minimal."
7292,145,1,9.0,2022-04-01,support,The ankle support and stability are some of the best on the market. These shoes also have one of the most supportive uppers I've played in this year.
7293,145,19,8.0,2022-04-10,support,"The stability plate starts out feeling stiff, but it breaks in and feels nice after a few hours of play."
7294,145,307,8.5,2022-06-06,support,"The support feels balanced, especially when I make cuts and elevate. Overall, the shoe has pretty good support."
7295,145,112,8.0,2022-04-03,support,The shoe has a great lockdown in the heel area. I had no issues with stability and lockdown overall.
7296,145,2,9.0,2022-03-29,support,I feel very supported and stable in this shoe. My foot does not slip at all.
7297,145,6,9.0,2022-03-31,support,I had absolutely zero issues with the support in the shoe. I didn't have any heel slippage or side-to-side foot movement either.
7298,145,293,7.5,2022-04-12,support,"For lateral containment, I was good to go. The upper and outsole provide a lot of lateral support. I did have an issue with lateral stability because of the rounded heel, though."
7299,145,365,9.0,2022-06-06,support,"The heel lockdown is great, and there's a tremendous amount of torsional support."
7300,145,1,8.0,2022-04-01,fit,"The fit is the biggest bummer of the shoe for me. Unlike other New Balance shoes, these do not come in multiple widths. Other than that, they do fit well enough."
7301,145,307,8.0,2022-06-06,fit,The shoe started out snug but broke in the more that I played in it.
7302,145,2,8.0,2022-03-29,fit,The lacing system on the shoe is also improved. It helps to provide a better fit.
7303,145,6,8.0,2022-03-31,fit,"The front half of the shoe has a narrow and snug fit that creates some pressure around your pinky toe. It does break in the more you play, though."
7304,145,293,8.0,2022-04-12,fit,"The shoe fits me very well. It is snug in the toe box, however. The materials also don't loosen much."
7305,145,365,8.0,2022-06-06,fit,"Overall, I get a solid fit from the shoe. It feels snug and provides just enough wiggle room in the toe box."
7306,145,1,100.0,2022-04-01,outdoor,The rubber is very durable.
7307,145,307,50.0,2022-06-06,outdoor,I'm not sure if this shoe will hold up well outdoors.
7308,145,112,100.0,2022-04-03,outdoor,I think that these shoes will play well outdoors.
7309,145,2,100.0,2022-03-29,outdoor,The rubber is thick and durable.
7310,145,6,100.0,2022-03-31,outdoor,The rubber is actually really hard. I would say that the shoe should be durable outdoors.
7311,145,293,50.0,2022-04-12,outdoor,"The rubber is hard, and the grooves are deep. The outsole seems durable."
7312,145,2,3,2022-03-29,width,Go true to size if you have a wide foot.
7313,145,6,2,2022-03-31,width,The forefoot and toe box areas are narrow.
7314,145,293,2,2022-04-12,width,"If you have a wide foot or want a roomier fit, I suggest going up a size."
7315,145,307,3,2022-06-06,size,"I went true to size, and it worked for me."
7316,145,2,4,2022-03-29,size,"If you have a regular foot shape, go half a size down."
7317,145,293,3,2022-04-12,size,I went true to size.
7318,146,1,8.6,2023-08-01,expert_overall,"The Anta KT 7 made my footwork feel improved. The cushioning is one of the best this year, and the support and stability are fantastic."
7319,146,293,8.4,2023-08-01,expert_overall,I enjoyed playing in the Anta KT 7. It's a solid shoe with impressive traction and surprisingly comfortable cushioning.
7320,146,20,8.0,2023-08-01,expert_overall,The Anta KT 7 is meant for players who like stability and cushioning. The setup is catered to non-shifty players who rely on a stable foundation.
7321,146,1,8.0,2023-08-01,traction,"The rubber is tacky, which creates grippy traction on hardwood courts as long as your feet are flat. Beware of dust, though."
7322,146,293,8.0,2023-08-01,traction,"On clean courts, the bite is unreal. It's hard to wipe the dust off, though."
7323,146,20,8.0,2023-08-01,traction,The rubber is grippy and squeaky. Dust pickup causes some slippage.
7324,146,1,10.0,2023-08-01,cushion,"A lot is going on in the cushioning. It's responsive and bouncy while incorporating shock absorption, especially under the heel."
7325,146,293,9.0,2023-08-01,cushion,"The cushioning setup is stacked with a high offset. The foam is soft, and there's plenty of impact protection."
7326,146,20,9.0,2023-08-01,cushion,"The cushioning is dense and bouncy. It has plenty of impact protection, though."
7327,146,1,8.0,2023-08-01,materials,"I have the Koi Fish version, which uses the Boa lacing system. It's secure and durable."
7328,146,293,9.0,2023-08-01,materials,I don't have problems with material quality or comfort. It conforms nicely and feels supportive.
7329,146,20,9.0,2023-08-01,materials,The materials and padding are comfortable. The assembly quality is solid too. The only downside is the weight.
7330,146,1,9.0,2023-08-01,support,There's a ton of lateral stability. It's secure in the forefoot and the midfoot. The winglets also provide tons of support.
7331,146,293,8.0,2023-08-01,support,Support and lockdown are not an issue. I felt contained and stable.
7332,146,20,7.0,2023-08-01,support,"The heel counter and stability are impressive, but I slid on the footbed because of the roomy width."
7333,146,1,8.0,2023-08-01,fit,The fit feels generous and accommodating.
7334,146,293,8.0,2023-08-01,fit,"The snug fit feels perfect for me. The offset does cause my feet to slide forward a bit, though."
7335,146,20,7.0,2023-08-01,fit,The KT 7 fits well for those with wide feet and high arches. It's wide and roomy.
7336,146,1,50.0,2023-08-01,outdoor,The outdoor performance is outstanding. Durability is fair.
7337,146,293,50.0,2023-08-01,outdoor,The outsole appears durable.
7338,146,293,2,2023-08-01,width,The width is slightly narrow.
7339,146,20,4,2023-08-01,width,There's extra width and room in the forefoot.
7340,146,293,3,2023-08-01,size,I went true to size.
7341,146,20,3,2023-08-01,size,We went true to size.
7342,147,112,8.3,2022-03-13,expert_overall,"I would recommend the Jordan Why Not 0.5 to all types of basketball players. The shoe was super responsive, and I felt explosive and quick playing in them."
7343,147,293,7.8,2022-03-16,expert_overall,"If the traction played better, the Jordan Why Not .5 would be a much better shoe. It checked all the boxes needed in a shoe, but the traction is a big con in my books."
7344,147,1,7.8,2022-04-05,expert_overall,"The Jordan Why Not Zero.5 offers a lot in terms of fit and comfort, but the performance is hindered by the traction."
7345,147,6,7.4,2022-03-23,expert_overall,"I cannot recommend the Jordan Why Not Zero.5. The traction does not bite, making it potentially dangerous to play in this shoe. It's a shame because everything else was solid."
7346,147,390,9.2,2023-01-21,user_overall,"Some of the most comfortable sneakers I've ever owned. The fit around the toe is also amazing. As someone with very wide feet I think that these sneakers may be a little wide for someone with slimmer feet, but for me and my wide feet they fit pretty much perfectly. The only problem is that the traction is bad, the pattern on the bottom of the shoe is unnecessary, and the fact that the middle of the sole doesn't have any traction at all. I only use these shoes as a daily/comfortable option."
7347,147,391,8.5,2022-04-15,user_overall,"I am a wide footed person so i decided to go half a size up just like i did for the 4.0, however i recommended going true to size, as this shoe is a slightl"
7348,147,256,8.9,2023-07-05,user_overall,"This shoe would have been amazing if they didn't use the damn rice grain pattern on the bottom. Other than a lackluster court feel, cushioning was great for impact protection, bounce, jumping, nearly everything, except it felt weird to shoot in because of the lack of court feel. If you dare use this outdoors say bye bye to the traction pattern in less than 20 wears."
7349,147,392,8.9,2022-03-27,user_overall,Everything about the shoe is amazing. Love the support and lockdown in why not.5. it's comfortable and feels good on foot. You can feel the forefoot zoom and it's really good. The only downside of the shoe is traction on dusty courts but if you're playing on clean a court you're good to go.
7350,147,393,8.0,2023-01-25,user_overall,The traction work very well on dir
7351,147,112,9.0,2022-03-13,traction,I was shocked with how well the traction held up on a dusty court. The traction was beastly for me.
7352,147,293,7.0,2022-03-16,traction,"The traction performance is not that good. In the first week, it was not biting hard at all. It did get a bit better over time, though."
7353,147,1,6.0,2022-04-05,traction,"The traction is not the best. The tread itself looks like it would perform, but the pattern is too close together to grab the court."
7354,147,6,5.0,2022-03-23,traction,"The Why Not Zero.5 features a nub-like traction pattern, and it's straight-up not good. It performs ok on clean courts. Anything less than that, though, you're going to slide."
7355,147,112,8.0,2022-03-13,cushion,"The cushioning felt great. The forefoot Zoom is noticeable, but it could be better."
7356,147,293,8.0,2022-03-16,cushion,The cushioning setup is my favourite part of the shoe. It reminds me of the Jordan 34 and 35.
7357,147,1,8.0,2022-04-05,cushion,The midfoot is a standard foam setup until you get to the forefoot Zoom Air unit. The shoe definitely feels bouncy. The only downside is that the performance tapers off when the foam bottoms out.
7358,147,6,8.0,2022-03-23,cushion,"The forefoot Zoom unit feels bouncy, and fans of Zoom units will enjoy this setup. The Phylon foam provides decent impact protection, but it isn't the best."
7359,147,112,8.0,2022-03-13,materials,The shoe has a nice amount of padding and feels comfortable on foot. My only complaint with the materials is that they aren't too breathable.
7360,147,293,8.0,2022-03-16,materials,"The materials are thin, and they conform to your foot nicely. The shoe feels cozy overall. However, the quality isn't the best."
7361,147,1,8.0,2022-04-05,materials,"The upper materials feel comfortable and secure around your foot. The lacing setup, however, isn't the best."
7362,147,6,8.0,2022-03-23,materials,"Overall, the material used isn't the best and not the most premium. It does the job in terms of performance, though. So, I can't complain."
7363,147,112,8.0,2022-03-13,support,"I had no issues with heel slippage, and the support was solid. My foot felt locked down."
7364,147,293,8.0,2022-03-16,support,"I had no issues with lateral containment. The shoe isn't the widest, but the lateral stability was still solid."
7365,147,1,8.0,2022-04-05,support,The shoe offers your ankle a ton of freedom of movement while still providing tremendous lockdown.
7366,147,6,8.0,2022-03-23,support,I had no support issues in this shoe.
7367,147,293,8.0,2022-03-16,fit,"It's a pretty snug fit in this shoe, which I like."
7368,147,1,9.0,2022-04-05,fit,This show might be the most comfortable fitting basketball shoe I've put on my foot.
7369,147,6,8.0,2022-03-23,fit,"After breaking in, I didn't have any issues with the fit. My foot felt secure and locked in while playing in these."
7370,147,1,0.0,2022-04-05,outdoor,The traction gave me the most trouble on painted outdoor courts.
7371,147,1,3,2022-04-05,width,"If your foot is over a 2E, you should go up half a size."
7372,147,6,3,2022-03-23,width,It was only a little bit narrow in the forefoot area.
7373,147,1,3,2022-04-05,size,They run a hair long. Go true to size if you have a medium or wide foot. Half a size down if you have a narrow foot.
7374,147,6,3,2022-03-23,size,"I am a slightly wide-footer, and I felt fine going true to size."
7375,148,7,9.3,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Zoom GT Jump has one of the best cushion setups on the market, especially if you like Nike Zoom. It's a shoe that I'm always going to have in my bag."
7376,148,394,9.0,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"I have no problems recommending the Nike GT Jump. Overall, I'm impressed. These are definitely worth it."
7377,148,1,9.0,2022-01-26,expert_overall,"The Nike GT Jump loads a  ton of tech into the shoe, making it one of the better shoes to come out recently. They help you pick up speed easier than any other shoe on the market. This combination is great when paired with the traction and cushion in the shoe."
7378,148,382,8.8,2022-02-22,expert_overall,The Nike Air Zoom G.T. Jump has a top-tier cushion and traction that holds its own. The shoe is definitely worth the price because of the tech that Nike includes.
7379,148,112,8.8,2022-02-28,expert_overall,"Yes, I would recommend the Nike Air Zoom G.T. Jump to anyone. The cushion is the best on the market, and the shoe is versatile enough to accommodate all playstyles."
7380,148,2,8.6,2022-01-26,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Zoom GT Jump is a pricey shoe that's worth every penny, in my opinion. It comes loaded with tech, and the performance reflects that."
7381,148,293,8.6,2022-02-22,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Zoom G.T. Jump offers one of the best cushioning setups in basketball right now. The traction performs well, and the shoe feels springy. Overall, this shoe is super fun to play in."
7382,148,6,8.6,2022-02-28,expert_overall,"Despite being a pricier shoe on the market, I have no issues recommending the Nike Air Zoom G.T. Jump, especially if you like impact protection and cushioning."
7383,148,395,7.8,2024-02-22,user_overall,"They could be one of my favorite basketball shoes, great traction, nice fit, very good cushion and angle support and they helped me jump higher. On the other hand the material used are cheap. The fabric above the toes, started to wear almost from the beginning and eventually two small holes appeared on the same spot on each shoe. The material used on the sides is like soft rubber and very easy to wear out. One of the airsole burst about 10-11 months after I bought them. I only used them indoors."

7387,148,398,9.3,2023-01-30,user_overall,overall best shoe i have ever owned its just like the advertisment says the cons are that when you run super much the shoe creases and rips.
7388,148,7,9.0,2022-01-22,traction,The multi-directional herringbone pattern is very reliable. I didn't need to wipe much at all.
7389,148,394,9.0,2022-01-22,traction,The herringbone pattern makes sure that the traction can handle multidirectional movements. They even gripped on the dusty courts I played on.
7390,148,1,10.0,2022-01-26,traction,I'd say the unsung hero of the shoe is the outsole tread. They gripped hardwood and hardcourts better than just about anything else I've used this year.
7391,148,382,8.5,2022-02-22,traction,"The bite on the traction isn't as hard as some of the top-tier shoes, but it performs well enough. It does take time to break them in, though."
7392,148,112,8.0,2022-02-28,traction,"The traction performs well, and I had no issues with it."
7393,148,2,8.0,2022-01-26,traction,"It grips on all court conditions. It doesn't squeak much for players that look for that in cushioning, though."
7394,148,293,8.0,2022-02-22,traction,"At first, the traction was not biting well. After about a week, the traction really started to perform better. The shoe can slide a bit when playing on dusty courts, but this was only a minor issue."
7395,148,6,8.0,2022-02-28,traction,"The herringbone traction pattern is decent, but definitely not one of the best."
7396,148,7,10.0,2022-01-22,cushion,I find this to be the craziest Zoom setup I've ever tried on. It's soft and provides a lot of impact protection. The only downside is that it's not low to the ground.
7397,148,394,10.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"The cushion is clearly a priority with this shoe. It's packed with a Zoom Strobel, Zoom Air and a Zoom Turbo unit. These felt nice to play in and they provide a lot of impact protection."
7398,148,1,10.0,2022-01-26,cushion,There is a Zoom Strobel going down the length of the shoe with a Zoom Air unit in the heel and a Zoom Turbo unit in the forefoot. This makes the shoe very fast and comfortable to play in.
7399,148,382,10.0,2022-02-22,cushion,The cushion on this shoe does not disappoint. It feels like having springs under your foot and is hands down one of the bounciest setups ever.
7400,148,112,10.0,2022-02-28,cushion,The cushioning is unbelievably comfortable; it might be the most comfortable I've ever felt.
7401,148,2,10.0,2022-01-26,cushion,"The main highlight of the GT Jump is the cushion. It only took me one game to feel how bouncy these are. They have a Zoom unit sitting below a Zoom Strobel, and it feels like an improved version of the Jordan 36 setup."
7402,148,293,10.0,2022-02-22,cushion,"The cushioning setup is amazing. There is a full-length Zoom Air Strobel, a forefoot Zoom Air unit, and a heel Zoom Air unit. Combine all that air with the Jump Frame, and this shoe is bouncy as hell."
7403,148,6,10.0,2022-02-28,cushion,"This shoe probably has the craziest cushion set up that I've ever felt. If you like Zoom, this is Zoom on steroids."
7404,148,7,9.0,2022-01-22,materials,"Screen mesh, Jumpwire, fuse, and synthetics form most of the shoe. These materials are free-flowing and breathable."
7405,148,394,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,The Jumpwire that Nike uses on the sides of the shoe works to make sure this shoe feels breathable.
7406,148,1,8.0,2022-01-26,materials,Nike Jumpwire makes up most of the shoe. The materials are solid both performance-wise and from a durability perspective.
7407,148,382,8.5,2022-02-22,materials,"Nike is using Jumpwire for the main body of the shoe. The materials make the shoe feel lightweight, durable, and breathable."
7408,148,112,9.0,2022-02-28,materials,"The materials feel comfortable on foot. Overall, the shoe feels phenomenal."
7409,148,2,8.0,2022-01-26,materials,Fuse mesh and jump wire make up a majority of the shoe. The main benefit of the materials is that they're durable while still feeling comfortable.
7410,148,293,8.0,2022-02-22,materials,"Overall, the materials are thin and supportive. Nike uses Jumpwire along the sides of the shoe, making the shoe light and breathable."
7411,148,6,8.0,2022-02-28,materials,The materials are light and breathable while still being supportive.
7412,148,7,9.5,2022-01-22,support,"The Jumpwire acts as a cage to support your foot on lateral movements, while the Jumpframe keeps your foot from sliding on the footbed."
7413,148,394,9.0,2022-01-22,support,Nike uses a Jumpframe to help keep you contained on top of all the cushioning. The shoe felt very secure.
7414,148,1,9.0,2022-01-26,support,The integrated lacing systems pairs well with Nike's Flywire to provide extra security. The Jumpframe also keeps you locked in while making quick movements.
7415,148,382,8.5,2022-02-22,support,The Jump Frame combines with the materials to keep your foot secure laterally.
7416,148,112,9.0,2022-02-28,support,"I had no issues with support once I figured out my ideal lacing setup. Once I got settled in, the support felt excellent."
7417,148,2,8.0,2022-01-26,support,The cushion wraps up at the rear of the shoe to cage your heel to provide ankle protection and containment.
7418,148,293,9.0,2022-02-22,support,The stability and containment provided by the shoe are much better than expected because of the Jump Frame.
7419,148,6,9.0,2022-02-28,support,"I had zero issues with support in this shoe. There is no side-to-side movement, and the support features do a great job of keeping you contained."
7420,148,7,9.0,2022-01-22,fit,"Even though these are considered a big man shoe, they aren't restrictive. I did have issues with pain in my Achilles and by my pinky toe that went away after adjusting the laces and breaking in the shoe."
7421,148,394,9.0,2022-01-22,fit,"I would say these fit similarly to the GT Cut, but the lacing system allows for a better-tailored fit."
7422,148,1,8.0,2022-01-26,fit,"With the lace hole setup, it's easy to get a nice tailored fit with these. They also accommodate both flat and high arch feet."
7423,148,382,8.5,2022-02-22,fit,"When I initially tried them on, they felt snug. However, after playing in them, the shoe definitely feels snug and narrow if you don't get the right size."
7424,148,112,8.0,2022-02-28,fit,"When it comes to sizing, the shoe felt good. The shoe really does conform to your foot."
7425,148,2,9.0,2022-01-26,fit,The fuse lace loops and Flywire cables allow the shoe to hug your foot. It feels form-fitting once you find the lacing setup you enjoy.
7426,148,293,8.0,2022-02-22,fit,"This shoe has a very snug fit, but going up half a size gave me enough room in the forefoot."
7427,148,6,8.0,2022-02-28,fit,I found it hard to slide my foot into the shoe to start out. It does get a little easier as the materials break-in.
7428,148,1,0.0,2022-01-26,outdoor,These aren't going to be the most durable for outdoor use.
7429,148,382,0.0,2022-02-22,outdoor,"The durability isn't the best, so I'm not sure how long they will hold up outdoors."
7430,148,112,0.0,2022-02-28,outdoor,I would never play with this sneaker outdoors.
7431,148,2,50.0,2022-01-26,outdoor,"I have an EP version, so the rubber feels durable."
7432,148,293,50.0,2022-02-22,outdoor,"The rubber is hard, but the grooves are thin."
7433,148,394,2,2022-01-22,width,"It is somewhat of a narrow design, so keep that in mind."
7434,148,1,2,2022-01-26,width,"The shoe tapers in the forefoot area, so you might want to go up half a size if you have wide feet."
7435,148,382,2,2022-02-22,width,The shoe feels narrow on foot.
7436,148,2,3,2022-01-26,width,"If you have a wide foot, I would suggest going half a size up."
7437,148,293,2,2022-02-22,width,"Width-wise, this shoe is pretty narrow."
7438,148,6,2,2022-02-28,width,I would say the fit is definitely narrow.
7439,148,394,3,2022-01-22,size,"I went true to size and had no issues. I did have some room at the front of the shoe length-wise, though."
7440,148,1,3,2022-01-26,size,"If you have a narrow or medium foot, these are going to fit you just fine."
7441,148,382,2,2022-02-22,size,I would recommend going up half a size.
7442,148,112,3,2022-02-28,size,"I went true to size, and the shoe felt good."
7443,148,2,3,2022-01-26,size,"If you have a regular foot, true to size will work for you."
7444,148,293,2,2022-02-22,size,"If you want to go true to size, make sure you have a skinny foot and that you like a snug fit."
7445,148,6,2,2022-02-28,size,"I went true to size, and I kind of wish I went up a half size."
7446,149,382,8.8,2022-03-14,expert_overall,"Adidas definitely stepped up and redeemed themselves with the Harden Vol. 6. You get superb traction, a comfy cushion, and strong support."
7447,149,293,8.6,2022-03-03,expert_overall,"Adidas has redeemed the Harden line with the Vol. 6. This shoe is a fantastic performer, and I love playing in them."
7448,149,394,8.6,2022-03-25,expert_overall,"The Adidas Harden Vol. 6 is a vast improvement from last year's shoe. Adidas is taking a step in the right direction with improved traction, cushion, and support."
7449,149,6,8.4,2022-02-21,expert_overall,"The Adidas Harden Vol 6 is the best Harden model I've played in, slightly edging out the Vol 1. There are improvements with both the traction and cushion. The only cons I can think of are the cheap-feeling materials and tight toebox."
7450,149,1,8.2,2022-02-21,expert_overall,The Adidas Harden Vol 6 is best for players looking to outwork their opponents with fast footwork. The cushion and traction offer a lot of versatility. Just be sure to avoid toe drags.
7451,149,112,8.0,2022-03-13,expert_overall,"The Adidas Harden Vol. 6 offers solid traction and comfort. The materials can be hit or miss depending on what you're looking for in a shoe, though."
7452,149,19,8.0,2022-03-25,expert_overall,"The traction and cushion on the Adidas Harden Vol. 6 are solid, but the fit and materials aren't up to par."
7453,149,311,9.4,2023-02-21,user_overall,"This shoe is amazing. Just good indoor and outdoor for all positions. Traction top tier, cushion responsive and plush with nice impact protection. The heel is very padded. If you want more forefoot bounce go with the vol 7 cuz the lightstrike there is a lil elastic and bouncier, and the heel in there is still boost with very good impact protection. Overall one of my fav shoes rn, I put them over the Don issue 4 and under the PG 6 by a lil. I got it for 50% of and all my money were worth it."

7455,149,224,8.5,2023-01-08,user_overall,"Pretty good, traction is almost top tier, cushion is the perfect medium between court feel and impact protection, support is awesome, BUT the materials are a huge let down, you literally can't play on them when it's hot on outdoors because there is no ventilation at all so you feel that your feet are burning, but a pretty good performer overall. They run a little bit long tho. And don't worry about the weight, the shoe is not bulky at all."
7456,149,400,7.4,2022-03-23,user_overall,"My experience with these shoes was on a dusty court, I cannot speak for how these shoes preform on a clean court. Overall, these shoes had pretty bad traction off the rip. I was constantly wiping and slipping. I’d say the cushion on these shoes is pretty good but the materials are cheap. The shoe is also a little on the bulkier side. If you plan to use these shoes on a court that tends to be dusty, I would not recommend these."
7457,149,141,8.0,2024-10-09,user_overall,I liked the shoe…it was pretty durable as I wore it a lot outdoors…I liked the cushioning..traction wasn’t the best though..the only problem I had with the shoe is the laces were way too long so they kept untying and stuff…but that’s fixable…and the only reason I wouldn’t buy the shoe would be it’s way too heavy…like too heavy…definitely reuses your vert a bit
7458,149,382,9.0,2022-03-14,traction,The traction on the Harden Vol. 6 uses herringbone throughout. It performs reliably and is really fun to play in.
7459,149,293,9.0,2022-03-03,traction,"The traction is phenomenal. It's actually top-tier traction on clear courts. On dustier courts, the shoe picks up some dust, but it wasn't a big distraction."
7460,149,394,9.0,2022-03-25,traction,The traction feels sticky and is a much more playable design. It's a big step forward for the Harden line.
7461,149,6,9.0,2022-02-21,traction,The herringbone traction performs very well after breaking in. You won't have issues with clear courts at all.
7462,149,1,8.0,2022-02-21,traction,The traction is one of the best parts of the shoe. The pattern used performs well once broken in.
7463,149,112,9.0,2022-03-13,traction,The traction was great. I had no issues whatsoever.
7464,149,19,9.0,2022-03-25,traction,The traction performed really well. It's one of the best things about the shoe. The traction works on all types of indoor courts.
7465,149,382,9.5,2022-03-14,cushion,"The Boost feels similar to the Harden Vol. 1, and I'm happy to see it return. It feels stable and responsive while still providing impact protection."
7466,149,293,9.0,2022-03-03,cushion,"The Boost midsole feels like the Harden Vol. 1. The court feel is extremely good, and the overall cushion is responsive."
7467,149,394,9.0,2022-03-25,cushion,"The Harden Vol. 6 returns to Boost, and the performance is much better than last year's model."
7468,149,6,9.0,2022-02-21,cushion,The full-length Boost midsole feels similar to the Harden Vol. 1 and 3. You feel the cushioning with every step you take.
7469,149,1,9.0,2022-02-21,cushion,"The bed of Boost foam gives you a very plush feeling under your foot. The Boost is concentrated in the heel, making the shoe feel agile."
7470,149,112,8.0,2022-03-13,cushion,"The full-length Boost midsole is soft and pliable. The comfort wasn't top-tier, but it did the job performance-wise."
7471,149,19,9.0,2022-03-25,cushion,The cushion and midsole remind me of the Harden Vol. 1. I really like how it feels.
7472,149,382,7.5,2022-03-14,materials,The materials look and feel cheap in hand. They were my least favourite part of the shoe.
7473,149,293,8.0,2022-03-03,materials,"The materials started out stiff, but became softer the more I played in them."
7474,149,394,8.0,2022-03-25,materials,"The upper is textile, and it feels softer than last year's. It isn't as breathable, but it doesn't bother me much."
7475,149,6,8.0,2022-02-21,materials,"The materials feel like a thick felt. It doesn't feel premium, but it does get the job done in terms of performance."
7476,149,1,7.0,2022-02-21,materials,The materials on the shoe are softer and more malleable than some others on the market.
7477,149,112,7.0,2022-03-13,materials,"The materials such as the tongue, laces, and heel pads feel comfortable and breathable. However, the upper is not breathable whatsoever. It also feels cheap."
7478,149,19,7.0,2022-03-25,materials,"The materials look nice, but they are disappointing quality-wise. My colourway gets dirty very easily."
7479,149,382,9.5,2022-03-14,support,The shoe offers solid torsional support and stability.
7480,149,293,9.0,2022-03-03,support,"The support and lockdown are really nice. Your foot will remain contained when making lateral movements. It's also a wide shoe, which will support you well."
7481,149,394,9.0,2022-03-25,support,The support is also much improved. Your foot feels more secure in this shoe.
7482,149,6,8.0,2022-02-21,support,"I had absolutely zero problems with the support of this shoe. There's no side-to-side movement on the footbed, and you feel secure when wearing these."
7483,149,1,9.0,2022-02-21,support,"Adidas is best-in-class in heel lockdown, and the Harden Vol. 6 isn't any different."
7484,149,112,8.0,2022-03-13,support,I didn't experience any heel slippage thanks to the foam pads that the shoe has in the Achilles area. I also felt very stable in the shoe.
7485,149,382,8.5,2022-03-14,fit,The padding around the shoe and the lacing system work well to accommodate the fit.
7486,149,293,8.0,2022-03-03,fit,The upper of the shoe conforms nicely to your foot. There is also some room in the toe box area.
7487,149,394,8.0,2022-03-25,fit,The shoe fits roomy.
7488,149,6,8.0,2022-02-21,fit,"The fit is good length-wise, but let me tell you, it is tight in the forefoot area. Other than the width, the rest of the shoe fits well."
7489,149,1,8.0,2022-02-21,fit,The shoe would be a good fit for both narrow and medium feet.
7490,149,19,7.0,2022-03-25,fit,The area just above the flex zone on my foot hurts when I play in these shoes. It also feels big on my foot.
7491,149,382,50.0,2022-03-14,outdoor,My pair doesn't have much fraying as the rubber is pretty hard.
7492,149,1,100.0,2022-02-21,outdoor,"Because of the hard rubber compound, the shoe actually grips better outdoors."
7493,149,293,4,2022-03-03,width,"If you have a wide foot, you should be fine."
7494,149,394,3,2022-03-25,width,The width feels fine.
7495,149,6,1,2022-02-21,width,"This shoe fits narrow. If you have a wide foot, you should consider sticking with true to size."
7496,149,1,3,2022-02-21,width,"If you have a 2E or wider foot, you might consider going with your regular shoe size."
7497,149,293,3,2022-03-03,size,You should be fine going true to size.
7498,149,394,4,2022-03-25,size,"I went true to size, but going down half a size probably would've been fine."
7499,149,6,4,2022-02-21,size,I would say these run large. I went down half a size.
7500,149,1,4,2022-02-21,size,I probably would go down a half size.
7501,150,293,8.8,2022-03-22,expert_overall,The Nike PG 6 is a shoe I can easily recommend. I didn't have to worry about anything when playing in these. They're comfortable with excellent traction and materials.
7502,150,6,8.6,2022-05-10,expert_overall,The Nike PG 6 is a must cop for the price. I consider this shoe an early contender for the best basketball shoe of 2022.
7503,150,112,8.5,2022-04-28,expert_overall,"I would recommend the Nike PG 6 for any player and any position, especially if you like a combination of response and comfort."
7504,150,1,8.4,2022-02-28,expert_overall,The Nike PG 6 is the best of both maximalist and minimalist worlds. It offers quick vertical movements with its grippy traction. Just be mindful that the cushion can bottom out quickly.
7505,150,7,8.3,2022-12-04,expert_overall,"The Nike PG 6 is one of the best basketball shoes for value. The support is fantastic, the fit is impressive, and the traction is reliable."
7506,150,45,7.8,2022-05-12,expert_overall,"The cushion and traction of the Nike PG 6 excelled, but the materials let down the shoe. Overall, I still really enjoyed playing in these."
7507,150,76,9.0,2024-08-04,user_overall,"great shoe! the traction is great and only picks up minimal dust but it’s an easy wipe, bites hard. cushion is like walking on literal clouds it’s so comfortable and bouncy and that paired with the fit and materials make this shoe unbelievably cosy and soft for extended time on court. it might fit slightly long so those who like snug toe box i would prob go down "
7508,150,214,8.8,2023-03-31,user_overall,"There is a reason this is one of the most worn shoes by NBA players. It’s light on the foot, supportive, and the cushioning is great right out of the box. The retail price on these is impossible to beat. The two cons with this shoe are breathability and cushion durability. They run a little hot, especially outside on a warm day. If they accumulate moisture, they stay damp for a while. While the cushioning is fantastic, it does bottom out faster than shoes that pair react with zoom air units."
7509,150,401,9.6,2023-03-21,user_overall,"'ve been wearing these shoes for 5 months and they are probably the best indoor basketball shoes to wear right now. The traction is perfect, even tho it picks up dust quickly. You won't have any issues if you play on a clean floor. The  cushion feels really comfortable, especially in the forefoot. I went 1/2 a size up and feels really comfortable on the toes.I wouldn't recommend them for outdoor use because it picks up dust fast and the traction starts fading away. Overall great shoes."
7510,150,224,9.0,2023-02-05,user_overall,"Pretty good, traction is insane right out of the box, cushion is really good for impact protection and responsiveness, I really like the materials, they are very lightweight and comfortable, the support is nothing special, but is not bad either, but is not a great option for outdoor play, I literally played only 10 minutos outdoor's with it and it already has some fraying, but overall a really good option for guards or even maybe a big who wants a lightweight shoe."
7511,150,146,8.6,2023-12-23,user_overall,This is th
7512,150,293,10.0,2022-03-22,traction,"For the traction, the bite is amazing. It grips well on both clean and dusty courts."
7513,150,6,10.0,2022-05-10,traction,"This traction pattern is insane. It surpassed my expectations. Dust does get stuck in the grooves sometimes, but nothing a wipe can't handle."
7514,150,112,9.0,2022-04-28,traction,"This shoe has good traction. It stuck like glue to a clean court. It does pick up dust on dirty courts, but the performance is not affected."
7515,150,1,9.0,2022-02-28,traction,The traction grips incredibly well; it performs best on indoor courts.
7516,150,7,8.5,2022-12-04,traction,"The traction performs very well indoors. The shoe has a hard bite, and I didn't have many issues."
7517,150,45,8.0,2022-05-12,traction,The traction performed as I expect traction to perform.
7518,150,293,8.0,2022-03-22,cushion,"There is no Air in this year's cushioning for the PG shoe. Instead, we have React foam. It offers a good amount of court feel and impact protection."
7519,150,6,8.0,2022-05-10,cushion,There is a full-length React midsole providing impact protection in the heel. It's more responsive in the forefoot at the sacrifice of some cushioning.
7520,150,112,9.0,2022-04-28,cushion,The React foam is my favourite part of the shoe. The shoe feels comfortable but responsive at the same time.
7521,150,1,8.0,2022-02-28,cushion,"The shoe has a full-length React midsole that helps the shoe feel explosive, soft, and springy."
7522,150,7,8.5,2022-12-04,cushion,"I wasn't expecting much from the cushioning, but the React held up nicely. It's plush underfoot, and it offers plenty of spring back."
7523,150,45,9.0,2022-05-12,cushion,"The full-length React cushioning is cozy, bouncy, and responsive. It's my favourite part of the shoe."
7524,150,293,9.0,2022-03-22,materials,"The materials used on the PG 6 are the best in the entire PG lineup. The textile feels comfortable, and the tongue comes well padded."
7525,150,6,9.0,2022-05-10,materials,"Textile materials make up a majority of the shoe. For the price, I can't complain. I would say the materials are the best in the PG lineup."
7526,150,112,8.0,2022-04-28,materials,The shoe has the perfect amount of padding. It provided solid lockdown and comfort.
7527,150,1,8.0,2022-02-28,materials,"The uppers are plush, padded, and comfortable. The con is that the shoe isn't breathable."
7528,150,7,6.5,2022-12-04,materials,You get what you pay for with the materials. It's a lot of synthetics and textile mesh. The materials are comfortable but of low quality.
7529,150,45,7.0,2022-05-12,materials,"The materials don't feel premium. It moves well and doesn't restrict your movement, but it doesn't feel high quality."
7530,150,293,9.0,2022-03-22,support,I was good to go for lateral containment because of the outsole portion that wraps up. Lateral stability was also solid.
7531,150,6,8.0,2022-05-10,support,I had zero issues with the support in this shoe. There was no heel slippage or side-to-side movement on the footbed.
7532,150,112,8.0,2022-04-28,support,I had no issues whatsoever with support and lockdown.
7533,150,1,9.0,2022-02-28,support,"Despite the midsole profile being chunky, the shoe itself remains stable. The lacing system on the shoe is also one of my favourites on a shoe this year."
7534,150,7,9.0,2022-12-04,support,"The shoe's support will keep you secure if you crank the laces. The base is also stable, which helps with support."
7535,150,45,7.0,2022-05-12,support,"Overall, the support was pretty good."
7536,150,293,8.0,2022-03-22,fit,"There's some extra room, length-wise, at the front of the shoe, but not enough to make me want to go down half a size."
7537,150,6,8.0,2022-05-10,fit,"The shoe is slightly long and narrow at the front of the shoe, but these weren't enough to affect performance."
7538,150,1,8.0,2022-02-28,fit,"When I first put them on, they were constricting. However, the shoe does break in the more you play."
7539,150,7,9.0,2022-12-04,fit,"I didn't have any issues with the fit. The materials break in quickly, and I enjoyed playing in this shoe."
7540,150,45,8.0,2022-05-12,fit,I really enjoyed the fit of the shoe because it was plush. The shoe really hugs the foot well.
7541,150,293,0.0,2022-03-22,outdoor,Durability does not seem like it's going to be good.
7542,150,1,0.0,2022-02-28,outdoor,"The traction performs outdoors, but the rubber doesn't feel hard enough to hold up outdoors."
7543,150,7,0.0,2022-12-04,outdoor,I'm not sure I would take these shoes outdoors.
7544,150,6,2,2022-05-10,width,I would say they are slightly narrow.
7545,150,1,3,2022-02-28,width,"The shoe isn't as narrow as I thought they'd be, but they do taper in the forefoot area."
7546,150,7,3,2022-12-04,width,Width didn't feel like an issue when I played in the shoe.
7547,150,6,3,2022-05-10,size,The shoe does run true to size.
7548,150,1,3,2022-02-28,size,Go true to size if you have a narrow or medium-sized foot.
7549,150,7,3,2022-12-04,size,Go true to size.
7550,150,45,3,2022-05-12,size,I had no problems going true to size.
7551,151,293,8.8,2022-03-05,expert_overall,"I love playing in the Jordan Zoom Separate. Due to the traction and cushion, I felt quick and smooth while playing in this shoe."
7552,151,7,8.6,2022-03-16,expert_overall,"Not only is the Jordan Zoom Separate a great budget model, but it's also a great shoe overall, regardless of the price point. I think Jordan Brand knocked these out of the park."
7553,151,2,8.6,2022-03-31,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zoom Separate is the shoe for you if you're looking for a budget shoe that provides traction, cushion, fit and stability. It is a well-rounded sneaker for the price."
7554,151,1,8.5,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zoom Separate is a solid option for players that want to outplay their opponents with footwork. The traction performs well, and the materials help keep the shoe light and easy to play in."
7555,151,2,8.2,2021-12-29,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zoom Separate is a solid budget-friendly shoe. The cushion setup provides lots of impact protection, and the traction grips well. The only downside is the quality of the materials isn't the greatest."
7556,151,6,8.2,2022-03-01,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zoom Separate is a must-cop for the price. It's a great performer and has a lot to offer. The traction is beastly, and the cushion provides a welcome balance of bounce and responsiveness."
7557,151,348,8.0,2021-12-29,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zoom Separate is the perfect shoe for forefoot-heavy players. They have good traction, impact protection, and breathable materials that fit well."
7558,151,169,10.0,2023-08-15,user_overall,Court feel isn’t amazing as its not low to the ground so for guards that are shifty i wouldn't recommend it how ever besides that the shoe is comfortable GREAT TRACTION picks up no dust at all even on very dusty courts. My one and only complaint is that its not low to the ground as I’m a light guard but thats me nit picking. Wide footers and heavy footers/ slower more patient players will LOVE THIS SHOE. Very Light shoe as well. If you have a narrow foot it will take time to get used to.
7559,151,402,9.0,2022-12-01,user_overall,"Traction was very nice, just needs a bit wiping on dust. Cushioning is perfect; foam around zoom unit is very soft and comfortable while zoom gives you decent springy feeling. Support was okay, not the best though due to the soft materials. Lace holes in the front can be ripped if you pull it too strong, be careful about that. Very comforable fabric in the front and decent mesh materials around the back. Fabric closes in on your foot when you wear and it feels awesome. Highly recommended."
7560,151,403,6.0,2022-11-06,user_overall,"The shoe was very comfortable, had a perfect fit, and even looked great. But the traction is horrendous. I slipped several times when I was doing spin moves and even when I took off the dribble jumpers. After literally 5 minutes of playing, the entire sole was covered with dust. Sure the court I played on was not very clean but I never had this problem with Zoom Freaks or Kyries. I was very disappointed with this shoe and returned it the next day."
7561,151,303,7.2,2023-04-18,user_overall,"Not a bad shoe for the price. Traction is good enough, lockdown wasn't amazing for me ran true to size and still had slippage. Support and comfort are subpar wasn't great for me even after adding cust"
7562,151,404,9.0,2022-03-20,user_overall,"This shoe is really good. The traction sticks and barely picks up dust, didn't even have to wipe. The vision is nice the phylon is soft and the zoom units prope"
7563,151,293,10.0,2022-03-05,traction,The traction is freaking phenomenal. It's top-tier traction.
7564,151,7,9.5,2022-03-16,traction,"On the court, this traction is awesome. I had no issues, and it performed great on all courts."
7565,151,2,9.0,2022-03-31,traction,"The traction is very grippy, even on dusty courts."
7566,151,1,9.0,2022-01-22,traction,The tread pattern has a lot of rubber to grab the court.
7567,151,2,8.0,2021-12-29,traction,The traction uses a radial pattern that is very grippy. I enjoyed playing with this setup a lot.
7568,151,6,9.0,2022-03-01,traction,The shoe features a bit of herringbone and wave pattern traction. It performs really well; you'll stop on a dime and make shifty movements easily.
7569,151,348,8.0,2021-12-29,traction,"The traction is an excellent performer on clean courts, but dust gives it problems."
7570,151,293,9.0,2022-03-05,cushion,"The cushioning setup is one of my favourite parts of the shoe. The Zoom unit is top-loaded, and you can feel the bounce and compression."
7571,151,7,8.5,2022-03-16,cushion,The Phylon in the feel is squishy and plush. The rectangle Zoom Air unit in the forefoot is soft and makes the shoe enjoyable to play in.
7572,151,2,9.0,2022-03-31,cushion,"The foam provides impact protection, and the forefoot Zoom unit is bouncy. The shoe also still manages to feel responsive."
7573,151,1,8.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"The cushion is comfortable out of the box, and the forefoot Zoom unit provides a good amount of bounce."
7574,151,2,9.0,2021-12-29,cushion,There's one air unit in the forefoot. It feels plush and provides plenty of impact protection.
7575,151,6,9.0,2022-03-01,cushion,I think the foam is Phylon; it's soft and feels nice. The Zoom unit in the forefoot feels bouncy enough. It provides a good blend of responsiveness and impact protection.
7576,151,348,8.5,2021-12-29,cushion,The bottom-loaded Zoom unit makes the cushion forefoot heavy. The foam feels soft and comfortable.
7577,151,293,8.0,2022-03-05,materials,"The textile materials are extremely thin. It does feel nice and comfortable, though."
7578,151,7,8.0,2022-03-16,materials,I enjoyed playing with the materials on this shoe.
7579,151,2,8.0,2022-03-31,materials,The upper is soft and requires very little break-in time. The shoe is lightweight and comfortable.
7580,151,1,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,The materials keep the shoe breathable and light. It was easy to move my feet with these on.
7581,151,2,7.0,2021-12-29,materials,"The materials aren't fancy using a combination of mesh and neoprene. They feel good, but not sure how long they will hold up."
7582,151,6,7.0,2022-03-01,materials,"The materials aren't of the highest quality, but they get the job done."
7583,151,348,7.0,2021-12-29,materials,"A free knit, neoprene, and screen mesh make up the shoe. They're breathable, but durability isn't the best."
7584,151,293,8.0,2022-03-05,support,I had no issues with lateral containment and lockdown. I never worried about the shoe at all while playing.
7585,151,7,9.0,2022-03-16,support,"The heel counter keeps your heel secure in the back of the shoe, and there is solid torsional rigidity. I had no issues with support and lockdown."
7586,151,2,9.0,2022-03-31,support,The lockdown and heel support are solid. I had no issues laterally either.
7587,151,1,9.0,2022-01-22,support,The TPU stabilizer and lace line provide great lockdown and stability for the shoe.
7588,151,2,9.0,2021-12-29,support,The shoe is very supportive. The lockdown and heel containment are also solid while feeling comfortable.
7589,151,6,8.0,2022-03-01,support,I would say that the support is pretty good overall. One standout is the customizable lacing setup. I did have a minor issue with sliding on the footbed towards the middle of the shoe.
7590,151,348,9.0,2021-12-29,support,"The forefoot support is probably the best feature on the shoe. It's amazing. The base is wide, and there's an outrigger for added stability."
7591,151,293,9.0,2022-03-05,fit,The shoe has a really snug fit. It conforms to your foot very well. I really enjoyed the snug fit of the shoe.
7592,151,7,8.0,2022-03-16,fit,"The shoe fits short, but the materials accommodate my foot regardless."
7593,151,2,8.0,2022-03-31,fit,I also enjoyed the adjustable lacing system. It allowed me to customize the fit to my liking.
7594,151,2,8.0,2021-12-29,fit,"The materials are forgiving, and there is some space in the forefoot area. The laces do allow you to dial in the fit, though."
7595,151,6,8.0,2022-03-01,fit,The materials in the forefoot fit around my foot nicely. There's only a minimal amount of dead space in the toe box.
7596,151,348,9.0,2021-12-29,fit,There's some wiggle room in the forefoot. So the shoe can accommodate players with slightly wide feet. They also provide the option to customize the fit by having extra eyelet holes.
7597,151,7,50.0,2022-03-16,outdoor,Durability is fine as I have minimal wear on my pair.
7598,151,2,50.0,2022-03-31,outdoor,The rubber is hard enough for outdoor use.
7599,151,1,50.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,The pattern of the rubber is deep and allows the shoe to grip well.
7600,151,7,3,2022-03-16,width,Wide-footers might need to go up half a size.
7601,151,2,3,2022-03-31,width,"If you have a wide foot, go true to size."
7602,151,2,3,2021-12-29,width,"If you have a wide foot, true to size should work for you."
7603,151,6,3,2022-03-01,width,"You could probably get away with going true to size if you have wide feet, but it's safer to try them on in-store."
7604,151,7,3,2022-03-16,size,Going true to size worked for me because of the materials.
7605,151,2,4,2022-03-31,size,I went half a size down and had no issues.
7606,151,2,4,2021-12-29,size,I went half a size down and had no issues.
7607,151,6,3,2022-03-01,size,I would say the Jordan Zoom Separate runs true to size.
7608,152,394,9.0,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Puma MB.01 is a fantastic start to a signature shoe line. Traction and cushion are the highlights, but nothing to point out for negatives on this model."
7609,152,32,9.0,2022-07-01,expert_overall,"The Puma MB.01 is a solid, all-around hoop shoe with nothing to complain about besides the lack of premium materials. It features well-performing traction and cushioning at a reasonable price."
7610,152,293,8.6,2022-01-08,expert_overall,"LaMelo Ball's first signature shoe, the Puma MB.01, is amazing. I love playing in these. This is a versatile option for a number of different playstyles."
7611,152,321,8.5,2022-01-04,expert_overall,The Puma MB.01 is one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn in a long time. I think these could be one of the best first signature shoes ever.
7612,152,1,8.5,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"LaMelo Ball's Puma MB.01 is an excellent all-around shoe that players who enjoy quick, nimbler movements will enjoy. The shoe offers solid traction, and the materials perform exceptionally."
7613,152,19,8.5,2022-01-26,expert_overall,"Overall, the Puma MB.01 is a pretty damn good shoe. It offers strong traction, cushioning, and upper materials."
7614,152,6,8.4,2022-01-04,expert_overall,The Puma MB.01 is a shoe that I highly recommend. It has a great balance of everything and is really fun to play in.
7615,152,221,8.3,2022-01-04,expert_overall,"Although they aren't the sleekest, the Puma Melo MB.01 does provide great balance and comfort. The cushion is a perfect balance, and the materials do a great job of keeping your feet feeling nice."
7616,152,112,8.2,2022-01-04,expert_overall,Puma did a great job of putting together LaMelo Ball's first signature shoe. The shoe is fun to play in and has little to no downsides.
7617,152,7,8.2,2022-02-01,expert_overall,I think the Puma MB.01 is a fantastic shoe at this price point. They might just be the best budget shoe out right now.
7618,152,320,9.1,2022-04-18,user_overall,"The Puma MB.01 is one of my favorite shoes. It looks nice and is a solid performer, although it takes time to break in. The cushion is very comfy, and while I mostly played on a dusty court, the traction was still solid, although it picked up dust pretty quickly. Pretty good lateral containment, but order 1/2 size up, because it is snug, and the laces are a little short. Outside use is ok, it will hold up but will look "
7619,152,405,8.8,2022-03-29,user_overall,"I love wearing this shoe. Once broken in it fits really nicely and the materials feel premium. I love the shoes nitro foam, not to mention the overall aesthetics of the shoe. It's truly one of one. It's traction picks up stuff like a vacuum though. It picks up dust so easily but now I just wipe my shoes every dead ball, but makes me feel like a baller. I also can't say it's impact protection is very good just because despite wearing low tops my whole career, I rolled my ankle in these."
7620,152,406,9.2,2022-09-06,user_overall,"These shoes are absolute fire!The cushioning is perfect for playing game after game without hurting your feet they also keep you close to the ground allowing you be quick and close to the court.The fact that they are mid tops that make your feet feel locked in but are also comfortable and flexible really sold me,I'm a quick PG and defensive playmaker and love the feel of mid tops but also like shoes that are light, supportive and have good court feel.The grip is great on clean courts."
7621,152,407,9.2,2022-01-10,user_overall,"The Puma MB01 is worth every penny in my opinion. I didn’t have huge expectations for a first model signature shoe costing only $125, Puma has really done an exceptional job with this particular model. It far surpasses anything Adidas has put on the market this year and is superior even to anything Nike and JB offer in this price range. The whole shoe feels very well padded and cushioned inside and out I am more than satisfied with what I got for what I paid."
7622,152,408,9.4,2022-06-29,user_overall,"When I first wore these shoes and tried them outdoors I was very disappointed but then - as I mostly play indoors - I tried them indoors and they were a masterpiece. They picked up very little dust that I could just wipe off, the cushioning was very comfortable, it's looks were very appealing and much more, however, the only small thing that I don't like about these shoes is that my feet get a little warm and sweaty because of the good cushioning."
7623,152,394,10.0,2022-01-22,traction,"Puma uses a non-slip rubber compound for traction, and there could not be a more accurate way to describe this shoe."
7624,152,32,8.0,2022-07-01,traction,"The traction isn't the best, and it takes time to break in. It's solid, though."
7625,152,293,10.0,2022-01-08,traction,"The traction performance is amazing. It sticks like glue, but it picks up dust pretty quickly. With wiping, you don't notice it, though."
7626,152,321,8.5,2022-01-04,traction,"It has one of the best tractions on a clean court. However, on dustier courts, it collects a lot of dust. It still performs well, but it will pick up dust."
7627,152,1,9.0,2022-01-22,traction,"The traction works similar to Formula 1 style tires, where the rubber gets traction from surface area contact. Overall, the shoe performed exceptionally well."
7628,152,19,8.0,2022-01-26,traction,"The traction doesn't pick up as much dust as expected. In terms of performance, it performed well but didn't grip as hard as I wanted."
7629,152,6,9.0,2022-01-04,traction,"The traction on here was pretty good. You'll have no issues whatsoever. The rubber is tacky, but it does pick up dust easily."
7630,152,221,7.0,2022-01-04,traction,"My experience with traction has been inconsistent. The rubber compound picks up a lot of dust, and the pattern is tight-knit."
7631,152,112,8.0,2022-01-04,traction,"The rubber compound picks up dust easily, but it still performs well."
7632,152,7,9.5,2022-02-01,traction,I barely had to wipe on a clean floor. The traction is really reliable.
7633,152,394,9.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The Nitro foam midsole is crazy soft. The comfort is nice and requires almost no break-in time.
7634,152,32,9.0,2022-07-01,cushion,I was surprised by how good the cushion felt in this shoe. It's perfect for high-energy players because it's soft and responsive.
7635,152,293,8.0,2022-01-08,cushion,"The full-length Nitro foam feels nice. It provides a bit of compression, but it's still soft."
7636,152,321,8.0,2022-01-04,cushion,"The foam that Puma used is responsive and lightweight. It feels perfect for most guard play. The impact protection isn't the best, but the court feel is good."
7637,152,1,8.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"It's a bottom-heavy feeling shoe, so it doesn't give you a crazy bounce. The shank is also below the foam, which helps the shoe mould better to your foot."
7638,152,19,9.0,2022-01-26,cushion,The Nitro Foam that Puma uses cradles your foot and provides a solid court feel. The best part is that the shoe doesn't compromise on cushioning to deliver that court feel.
7639,152,6,8.0,2022-01-04,cushion,The shoe features a full-length Nitro foam setup that provides a good balance of impact protection and responsiveness.
7640,152,221,9.0,2022-01-04,cushion,"The nitro foam cushion is legit. They're soft, plush, and accommodating while still providing impact protection and responsiveness."
7641,152,112,8.0,2022-01-04,cushion,"Cushion and comfort aren't the mainstays of the shoe. It's not uncomfortable, but it doesn't offer much compression. The shoe does provide a great court feel, though."
7642,152,7,7.5,2022-02-01,cushion,"The step-in comfort feels nice straight out of the box. The Nitro foam midsole feels dense to start, but it becomes bouncy after playing in them."
7643,152,394,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,"The textile mesh is consistent, light, and breathable."
7644,152,32,8.0,2022-07-01,materials,"The materials are light and breathable. It's stiff to start, but it feels much better after breaking them in."
7645,152,293,8.0,2022-01-08,materials,"The mesh material starts off stiff, but after breaking them in, it starts to feel soft. It also conforms nicely to your feet."
7646,152,1,9.0,2022-01-22,materials,The materials on the upper make the shoe feel like an extension of your leg. It's durable and comfortable.
7647,152,6,8.0,2022-01-04,materials,It has a full textile upper mixed with some plastic and fuse overlays. The materials are industry standard.
7648,152,221,9.0,2022-01-04,materials,This shoe is one of the most well-padded performance models. They are very comfortable. The only downside is that they could've been of higher quality.
7649,152,112,8.0,2022-01-04,materials,The padding in the shoe makes this shoe very comfortable. I like the materials.
7650,152,7,7.0,2022-02-01,materials,"The materials feel stiff right from the get-go, but they break in nicely. It's nothing special quality-wise, but it works."
7651,152,394,8.0,2022-01-22,support,I didn't have any issues with the lateral containment and support when I played in this shoe.
7652,152,32,8.0,2022-07-01,support,"The foam and lateral cage provide solid support and stability. I experienced minor heel slippage, but tightening my laces removed that issue."
7653,152,293,8.0,2022-01-08,support,I had no issues with the support and lockdown. The materials do a great job of providing lateral containment.
7654,152,321,8.9,2022-01-04,support,"The containment is good, but I have issues with heel slippage."
7655,152,1,8.0,2022-01-22,support,The foam rising up on the lateral side of the shoe do a good job of absorbing your weight and force to help support you on lateral movements.
7656,152,19,9.0,2022-01-26,support,The TPU and rubber that come up on the lateral side of the shoe cover you. The lacing and heel counter also perform well to keep you secure.
7657,152,6,8.0,2022-01-04,support,"Your heel is locked in and contained. There's no movement on the footbed, and the base is wide enough to prevent your ankle from rolling over."
7658,152,112,9.0,2022-01-04,support,"For lockdown, I had no issues. It's a sturdy shoe that helps hold you in place."
7659,152,7,8.5,2022-02-01,support,The internal heel counter and plastic TPU plate on the side work in-sync to harness your foot on lateral movements. I found the support to be great.
7660,152,394,10.0,2022-01-22,fit,The fit is pretty much perfect.
7661,152,32,9.0,2022-07-01,fit,The fit of the shoe is snug before breaking in later on.
7662,152,293,9.0,2022-01-08,fit,"The length of the shoe is perfect for me. It also has a snug toe box, which is something that I prefer in my basketball shoes."
7663,152,321,8.0,2022-01-04,fit,The combination of the material ultimately allows for a 1-to-1 fit. They do a great job of locking you down.
7664,152,19,8.0,2022-01-26,fit,The fit conforms to your feet nicely once you dial in the lacing.
7665,152,6,9.0,2022-01-04,fit,"I experienced no pain or stiffness in the mid and forefoot areas. If you have a narrow foot, you may experience extra room in the toe box."
7666,152,221,8.0,2022-01-04,fit,"The shoe is going to be one of the best at accommodating a wider group of players. However, it could be a tiny bit tricky for those that prefer a snug fit."
7667,152,112,8.0,2022-01-04,fit,The materials are excellent for providing a comfortable fit. They feel great.
7668,152,7,8.5,2022-02-01,fit,This shoe fits me nicely. There isn't much movement once you clamp the laces down.

7670,152,293,50.0,2022-01-08,outdoor,"The nubs are large, and the rubber feels hard."
7671,152,1,50.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,"The shoe performs well outdoors, but the durability isn't the best."
7672,152,7,100.0,2022-02-01,outdoor,I found the compound to be durable as well.
7673,152,293,3,2022-01-08,width,"If you need a roomier fit, you might want to go up half a size."
7674,152,321,3,2022-01-04,width,"If you have slightly wide feet, I would stick with going true to size. They accommodated me nicely."
7675,152,1,3,2022-01-22,width,"The MB.01 has a more generous fit profile. If your foot is wider than 2E, I recommend going up half a size."
7676,152,6,3,2022-01-04,width,I would say the shoe caters to wide feet well.
7677,152,7,2,2022-02-01,width,The shoe is a little narrow in the forefoot.
7678,152,293,3,2022-01-08,size,"I went true to size, and it fits me extremely well."
7679,152,1,3,2022-01-22,size,Going true to size will accommodate most.

7683,153,293,8.5,2022-01-28,expert_overall,"The Nike Fly By Mid 3 is Nike's lowest-priced shoe, but don't let that fool you. This shoe was a pleasant surprise. I liked playing in these a lot more than expected."
7684,153,6,8.0,2022-01-28,expert_overall,"The Nike Fly By Mid 3 is a solid performance shoe at a low retail price. The cushion surprised me, and the traction is just what you want from a basketball shoe."
7685,153,3,8.0,2023-07-19,expert_overall,"The Nike Fly By Mid 3 provides a bit of everything. The traction is impressive for the price, and it feels minimal overall."
7686,153,19,6.8,2022-03-25,expert_overall,"As much as I want to recommend the Nike Fly By Mid 3, I can't because of the fit and traction. It could still be worth it for those looking for an affordable budget option."
7687,153,348,6.2,2022-02-28,expert_overall,"The Nike Fly By Mid 3 is an okay shoe for the price. There are better shoes at this price point, however. I'd only consider this if budget is your biggest factor."
7688,153,409,7.4,2023-09-03,user_overall,"Outdoor review:- For its price its a steal. It wasnt the most durable shoe on Earth but for its price it lasted well. The cushioning for its price is amazing like I played in these for 3 months straight, never had i had foot pain. It has decent traction, u wont be stopping like you would with other pricier shoes but u will be stable enough. Not that good lockdown tho, but again for the price you really cant ask for much. Quite a decent and good shoe for its price.Buy it for practise or pass time"

7690,153,410,9.1,2023-01-15,user_overall,"The shoes is really good for the price, the cushioning is good and the traction is good but it doesn't do well on dusty courts. It is VERY durable, I use it everywhere,school,playing basketball and even for hiking (I have been using these shoes for almost a year) . The only thing bad about this shoe is that doesn't do well on dusty courts."
7691,153,411,8.5,2022-02-19,user_overall,"This shoe provides good traction, cushion and solid materials for a cheaper shoe. However, I do not recommend it for wide-footers, if you want it get it half a size up if you have wider feet because it runs true to size. The fit was good, but lateral support could be better. A good shoe for a cheap price."
7692,153,412,8.0,2022-10-24,user_overall,Very similar performance to KD Trey 5 IX. Solid feel on feet. Easy to jump in. Somewhat acceptable traction.
7693,153,293,9.0,2022-01-28,traction,"The traction is really nice. I feel like I needed to break them in a bit, but after that, it greatly improved."
7694,153,6,9.0,2022-01-28,traction,"The traction works really well. You'll have no problems with clean courts, and the traction holds up on dustier courts too."
7695,153,3,9.0,2023-07-19,traction,The traction feels excellent.
7696,153,19,6.0,2022-03-25,traction,"The traction is mediocre. It holds up well enough on clean courts, but dust gives the shoe problems."
7697,153,348,7.0,2022-02-28,traction,"The traction pattern is inconsistent, but it does perform well enough to get the job done on clean courts."
7698,153,293,9.5,2022-01-28,cushion,The cushion is my favourite part of the shoe. It's low to the ground while still providing step-in comfort. The most surprising aspect of this setup is the impact protection it provides.
7699,153,6,8.0,2022-01-28,cushion,"I have no idea what cushioning in this shoe, but it is very plush and soft. It feels much better than expected."
7700,153,3,8.0,2023-07-19,cushion,"Cushioning feels fluid, low to the ground, and responsive."
7701,153,19,8.0,2022-03-25,cushion,"There's nothing special about the cushion. The court feel is ok, but the impact protection was better than expected. I liked it."
7702,153,348,7.0,2022-02-28,cushion,"Nike uses regular Phylon for the cushioning, and it feels basic. It took about 3 hours to break them in to feel comfortable."
7703,153,293,8.0,2022-01-28,materials,"The mesh feels cheap, but it's thin and flexible. It molds nicely to the foot, and it performs well."
7704,153,6,8.0,2022-01-28,materials,"Mesh makes up most of the upper, but synthetic leather is mixed in here and there. It feels nice and performs well."
7705,153,3,8.0,2023-07-19,materials,"The shoe is lightweight and minimal, but the quality isn't the best."
7706,153,19,7.0,2022-03-25,materials,"It's a budget model, so don't expect much from the materials. It was enough to get the job done, though."
7707,153,348,5.0,2022-02-28,materials,"The textile mesh also feels basic. However, it does conform to your foot well enough over time."

7709,153,6,7.0,2022-01-28,support,"I had no issues with containment, but I did have a bit of sliding motion on the footbed. The sliding seemed to happen when I made hard lateral movements."
7710,153,3,7.0,2023-07-19,support,The support and lateral containment could be better because of the soft upper.
7711,153,348,6.0,2022-02-28,support,"There's no outrigger on the shoe, but the base width makes up for that. Nothing is amazing in terms of support. It's just barely enough."
7712,153,293,8.0,2022-01-28,fit,The toe box area of the shoe feels snug and kind of narrow.
7713,153,6,8.0,2022-01-28,fit,"Over time the shoe does break in nicely. Other than some tightness in the forefoot to start, I wasn't bothered by the fit."
7714,153,3,8.0,2023-07-19,fit,I had no issues with the fit in my size.
7715,153,19,6.0,2022-03-25,fit,The fit and sizing is the biggest issue for the shoe. There was too much room in the shoe for me.
7716,153,348,6.0,2022-02-28,fit,"The shoe starts out feeling narrow and long, but the flimsier mesh does loosen up."
7717,153,293,100.0,2022-01-28,outdoor,The rubber also feels durable enough to handle outdoor play.
7718,153,6,100.0,2022-01-28,outdoor,I think these will hold up outdoors. The rubber is thick.
7719,153,6,3,2022-01-28,width,"I have a slightly wide foot, and it still fits me well. Try them on if possible if you have wider feet."

7723,154,20,8.6,2023-04-13,expert_overall,The Adidas Harden Stepback 3 showed great results during our tests. The traction and cushioning will be solid for guards and wings.
7724,154,1,8.4,2022-07-26,expert_overall,"I was presently surprised with the Adidas Harden Stepback 3. They might be the best budget shoe in recent memory, especially for shifty guards that rely on heavy footwork."

7727,154,413,8.3,2022-12-27,user_overall,"The shoe is overall pretty good, the traction and outdoor performances are really good even when you're playing on a paved road. I have a wide feet and i sticked true to size which i think was a good idea. But i don't know if it's my wide feet or not that's causing me to feel a burn below my toes whenever i stay idle for a couple of minutes. Basically, i really recommend this shoes if you're on a budget. You might wanna go up half a size if you got a super wide feet, if not, stick true to size."
7728,154,116,8.8,2024-01-11,user_overall,I really liked the Stepback 3!!! An incredible shoe fo
7729,154,414,8.8,2023-04-15,user_overall,"I love the dell of the materials and the cushion. The traction is incredible outdoors but completely horrid indoors if not warmed up. Playing in these indoors was completely unbearable for me I was constantly slipping. Outdoors is the complete opposite however. The traction, cushion court fell fit and bounce are all on point. I would only recommend it for outdoor though."

7732,154,20,9.0,2023-04-13,traction,"The traction provides excellent grip, and dust pickup is not an issue."
7733,154,1,9.0,2022-07-26,traction,The outsole tread is my favourite part of the shoe. It grips well when going side-to-side.
7734,154,307,8.0,2022-08-16,traction,The traction feels tacky and performed well.
7735,154,293,8.0,2022-12-22,traction,"After breaking in the traction, it started to perform well. You stop nicely on clean courts. It does pick up dust quickly, but it doesn't affect performance if you wipe it."
7736,154,20,9.0,2023-04-13,cushion,The Bounce foam evolves and provides impressive cushioning with the more you play. It's well-balanced. I had no issues with impact protection when dunking.
7737,154,1,8.0,2022-07-26,cushion,"Adidas built this midsole with performance in mind. The full-length Bounce foam is comfortable, and the shank makes the shoe bouncy."
7738,154,307,7.0,2022-08-16,cushion,The step-in comfort felt nice but could be better.
7739,154,293,7.0,2022-12-22,cushion,Adidas uses full-length Bounce to offer a solid court feel but not much compression.
7740,154,20,8.0,2023-04-13,materials,The materials are simple and inexpensive. Breathability could be better.
7741,154,1,8.0,2022-07-26,materials,"The materials remind me of the Trae Young 1, and the shoe offers similar comfort. The downside is they aren't the most breathable pair."
7742,154,307,8.0,2022-08-16,materials,"I like that the materials aren't heavy. The shoe isn't light, but it's well-balanced."
7743,154,293,8.0,2022-12-22,materials,"The materials are soft, and they conform to your foot well. There's no break in time for the shoe to feel comfortable."
7744,154,20,8.0,2023-04-13,support,"Heel lockdown is good. There's no pronounced outrigger, but the base is wide enough to keep you stable. There are no torsional plates, though."
7745,154,1,8.0,2022-07-26,support,The lockdown and stability are solid in this shoe.
7746,154,307,8.0,2022-08-16,support,"The ankle support feels solid for a budget shoe, but the comfort from the support features could be better."
7747,154,293,8.0,2022-12-22,support,Lateral containment is not an issue. I was also good to go with lateral stability.
7748,154,20,9.0,2023-04-13,fit,The shoe has no issues accommodating different foot shapes. It's well-padded and comfortable on your feet.
7749,154,1,9.0,2022-07-26,fit,"The forefoot is boxy and ergonomic, but the shoe can accommodate a lot of foot shapes."
7750,154,307,8.0,2022-08-16,fit,The shoe fits too snugly for my liking. I prefer a bit more room when I play.
7751,154,293,8.0,2022-12-22,fit,The shoe fits me well.
7752,154,1,100.0,2022-07-26,outdoor,"The darker rubber is more durable than the lighter rubber, but the traction will still perform well outdoors."
7753,154,307,50.0,2022-08-16,outdoor,The rubber looks like it will last.
7754,154,293,100.0,2022-12-22,outdoor,The rubber is thick enough to take outdoors.
7755,154,293,2,2022-12-22,width,Go up half a size if you have a wide foot.
7756,154,1,3,2022-07-26,size,I recommend going true to size.
7757,154,307,2,2022-08-16,size,I would go half a size up.
7758,154,293,3,2022-12-22,size,"I went true to size and enjoyed the fit, but if you don't like your toes close to the front of the shoe, go up half a size."
7759,155,293,8.8,2021-12-25,expert_overall,The Nike Kyrie 8 is an overall great feeling shoe. It provides balance with the weight while still remaining a quality performer. Cushioning and materials are the standouts for me.
7760,155,382,8.8,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie 8 is one of the better options from Nike this year. They give you solid traction if you keep them clean, and the underfoot cushion performs well."
7761,155,19,8.6,2022-01-18,expert_overall,"I love the Nike Kyrie 8. They are the most comfortable and functional Kyrie model to date. The traction is one of the only aspects that doesn't improve from last year, but the rest of the shoe is excellent."
7762,155,1,8.6,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie 8 performs well for players that want nimble footwork, control, traction and stability. Be aware that the shoe may not be the best for more explosive players."
7763,155,2,8.4,2021-11-25,expert_overall,"I really enjoyed playing in the Nike Kyrie 8. The cushioning setup is the best in the entire Kyrie lineup, and the traction performs well as always."
7764,155,6,8.4,2022-02-22,expert_overall,The Nike Kyrie 8 is a solid pickup for the price. The only downside is the break-in time needed for the traction to get going. Everything else about the shoe is awesome.
7765,155,7,8.1,2022-03-07,expert_overall,The Nike Kyrie 8 is my favourite Kyrie of all time. They are my favourite Kyrie model to play in. It should be a fantastic shoe for guards and players that don't need much torsional rigidity.
7766,155,353,9.0,2023-04-03,user_overall,"This shoe is the best deal you can get for under $100 right now! On sale most places, you can even find it for between $50-70 if you shop around enough. G"
7767,155,192,9.5,2024-03-16,user_overall,"This is my first and only Kyrie model I'll ever own for now. Ever since Kyrie left Nike for Anta, I knew I had to own at least one of his signature sneakers before it's too late. Luckily I was able to snag the South Beach colorway as shown above. Traction was great, support was awesome, cushion was actually great for a Kyrie and the materials were above average. It held up its own on the outdoors too, and as icing on the cake, I love the fact the tongue of this shoe was so plush and well-padded."
7768,155,231,8.7,2023-08-26,user_overall,"This shoe is very bouncy with its zoom strobel in the forefoot great impact protection with its zoom air unit in the heel. It has my favorite cushioning in my collection because it doesn't sacrifice any ground feel. The traction is really good on dust and overall above average. The uppers are flexible and breathable offering good lateral support. The shoe fits great if you have a narrow to small foot, and I still went down a half size. It has average durability which is its biggest flaw."
7769,155,416,9.0,2022-06-04,user_overall,"Tractions: Good, but not as good as the Jordan 36. Very slight amount of slip when planting hard with momentum, but it feels controlled and never dangerous. Dust resistant, never "
7770,155,309,8.8,2023-03-15,user_overall,Possibly the best kyrie shoe out there. The new cushion setup gives the coveted low-to-ground feel while giving a surprising amount of bounce back. Traction is tacky and has minimal dust pickup. Materials are easy to break in and support the ankles very well. The fit is glove-like and has the perfect balance of compression for stability and flexibility for footwork and running. This is one of my favorites and I can always rely on this shoe for consistency and comfort.
7771,155,293,8.0,2021-12-25,traction,"At first, the traction did not have a good bite. After breaking them in, it started to perform a lot better, though."
7772,155,382,8.5,2022-01-22,traction,"The grip on the outsole is good. It grips well, especially on clean courts."
7773,155,19,8.0,2022-01-18,traction,The traction performed well but wasn't quite as good as the Kyrie 6 or 7 for me. It worked everywhere and in all directions.
7774,155,1,8.0,2022-01-22,traction,These shoes are going to give you a lot of grip when turning corners and changing directions.
7775,155,2,9.0,2021-11-25,traction,The traction was amazing on a clean court after an initial break-in period. It also handles dust very well.
7776,155,6,8.0,2022-02-22,traction,The traction on this shoe is solid. It starts poorly but breaks in nicely afterwards.
7777,155,7,8.5,2022-03-07,traction,"The traction pattern goes in every direction, and I really enjoyed it. After spending about an hour breaking them in, the performance became awesome."
7778,155,293,9.0,2021-12-25,cushion,"The cushioning setup is one of my favourite parts of the shoe. It feels softer than the older Kyrie models, and the forefoot Zoom Strobel unit feels very bouncy."
7779,155,382,9.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"The cushion feels bouncy, smooth, and responsive. It felt the best in the forefoot area of the shoe."
7780,155,19,9.0,2022-01-18,cushion,"The cushion feels like injected Phylon. It's soft and allows you to feel the Zoom unit/Zoom Strobel in the heel and forefoot, respectively. These are easily the best features of the shoe."
7781,155,1,9.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The Kyrie 8 has one of the better setups Nike has released in terms of cushion and responsiveness.
7782,155,2,9.0,2021-11-25,cushion,The Kyrie 8 uses a Zoom Strobel in the forefoot that feels bouncy. It also has a heel Zoom unit that provides extra impact protection. I love the setup.
7783,155,6,9.0,2022-02-22,cushion,The Air Zoom Strobel in the forefoot feels great as you sit right on top of it.
7784,155,7,9.0,2022-03-07,cushion,"The cushioning setup is responsive, low to the ground, and provides solid impact protection. This setup makes this shoe the best cushioned in the Kyrie lineup."
7785,155,293,9.0,2021-12-25,materials,I enjoyed playing with these materials a lot. They don't feel cheap while still being thin and comfortable.
7786,155,382,9.0,2022-01-22,materials,"The materials give the shoe a comfy and premium feel. It's thin, light, and durable as well."
7787,155,19,9.0,2022-01-18,materials,"For a performance shoe, these are very comfortable. Definitely an improvement from the previous year's models."
7788,155,1,9.0,2022-01-22,materials,The Kyrie 8 has the most padded tongue I've seen on any shoe. The fit of the materials makes it so that the shoe feels plush.
7789,155,2,8.0,2021-11-25,materials,The materials feel like a softer version of the materials used on the Kyrie 6.
7790,155,6,9.0,2022-02-22,materials,The materials used on this shoe are probably the best materials to appear on a Kyrie shoe in years. I have no complaints about the materials at all.
7791,155,7,7.5,2022-03-07,materials,I enjoyed the materials on the back half of the shoe more than the forefoot.
7792,155,293,9.0,2021-12-25,support,I had no issues at all with the support and lockdown. It has phenomenal lateral containment.
7793,155,382,8.5,2022-01-22,support,The standard support features on the shoe provide solid support. The only problem is that some lateral movements caused my foot to slide on the footbed.
7794,155,19,9.0,2022-01-18,support,The lacing setup compresses the upper around your foot to provide support and lockdown. They do a good job of closing in around your foot.
7795,155,1,8.0,2022-01-22,support,The lacing system used on this shoe makes the lockdown very good.
7796,155,2,8.0,2021-11-25,support,"I had no issues with heel containment, and the lockdown is excellent."
7797,155,6,8.0,2022-02-22,support,I had zero issues with the support on the Kyrie 8.

7803,155,2,8.0,2021-11-25,fit,They fit consistently with all of the previous Kyrie's.
7804,155,6,8.0,2022-02-22,fit,"The fit of the shoe starts out snug because of the narrower forefoot area, but I didn't have any issues."
7805,155,7,8.0,2022-03-07,fit,"The fit isn't my favourite, but it wasn't bad once I got the right size."
7806,155,293,0.0,2021-12-25,outdoor,I don't think the rubber is going to hold up outdoors.
7807,155,382,0.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,"If you mainly play outdoors, these shoes may not be the best."
7808,155,7,50.0,2022-03-07,outdoor,"I think you could get away with using this shoe outdoors. The rubber is firm, and the grooves are not shallow."
7809,155,382,2,2022-01-22,width,"If you have a wide foot, I recommend going up half a size."
7810,155,1,2,2022-01-22,width,"If you have a wider foot, you better be going up a half size in these."
7811,155,6,2,2022-02-22,width,This shoe fits slightly narrow.

7813,155,382,3,2022-01-22,size,"I went true to size, and the shot fits me perfectly well."
7814,155,1,3,2022-01-22,size,True to size if you have a narrow or medium-width foot.
7815,155,2,3,2021-11-25,size,I would say go true to size or go with the same size as your previous Kyrie models.
7816,155,6,3,2022-02-22,size,I went true to size and I felt pretty good.
7817,155,7,2,2022-03-07,size,I had to go up half a size.
7818,156,32,9.5,2021-12-01,expert_overall,"The Under Armour Curry 9 is an overall improvement from the Curry 8. The traction and cushion remain fantastic, but the materials and support perform better in this year's model."
7819,156,382,9.2,2022-03-06,expert_overall,"The Under Armour Curry 9 is one of my go-to shoes right now. The traction and cushion remain solid, and the materials are greatly improved. This shoe is definitely worth the price."
7820,156,293,9.0,2021-12-19,expert_overall,"The Curry 9 feels like a running shoe that has the lateral containment needed for basketball. The traction is top-tier, and the cushion feels responsive. I absolutely love playing in this shoe."
7821,156,2,9.0,2022-01-18,expert_overall,"The Curry 9 is pretty similar to the Curry 8 for the most part. However, there is an improvement in the materials used this year; this leads to improved support and fit."

7825,156,417,10.0,2022-03-02,user_overall,"The shoes are extremely light which makes you feel quicker and faster as soon as you put them on. The grip on these are amazing, you really can stop on a dime and change direction with ease. The cushioning is comfortable and responsive I played all day in them. Great stability didn’t even think about rolling or turnin"
7826,156,353,9.0,2023-04-03,user_overall,"On most courts the Flow traction will be the best traction you’ve ever experienced. Some players say the traction is inconsistent on some dusty courts and certain court finishes, but I’ve never had"
7827,156,418,5.8,2022-10-13,user_overall,"After years of staying away from Under Armor, I decided to give this shoe a try. And I am definitely never buying an under armor basketball"
7828,156,419,8.0,2022-03-18,user_overall,"The shape of the shoe inside is very particular. I bought them online, true to my Nike size and they felt small. When I laced them up they fit,  but I still thought maybe I should have bought half-size bigger. I would definitely recommend trying these on in a regular shop before buying.  Now their traction is superb. They are great for runners and cutters, super light and you feel much more agile in them overall. However, my feet did for some reason feel more fatigued than I normally get."
7829,156,169,10.0,2023-09-25,user_overall,This Shoe paired with “Grip Spritz” which is a spray for your shoes to have better traction made this shoe a 10/10 amazing shoe However w/o the spray the traction was terrible and picked up hella dust however w the spray IT PICKED UP NO DUST BY FAR THE BEST TRACTION ON A SHOE IVE EVER HAD. Traction/ lightness of this shoe makes for an amazing shoe the spray is super cheap too and works on other shoes but this shoe with the spray was fuckin fantastic. Its now my new fav shoe to hoop in
7830,156,32,10.0,2021-12-01,traction,The Curry 9 has ridiculously grippy traction. The Flow material has no skidding and sliding whatsoever.
7831,156,382,9.0,2022-03-06,traction,The Flow outsole is the same as the Curry 8. It's still one of the hardest biting tractions ever.
7832,156,293,10.0,2021-12-19,traction,"The traction performs amazingly. The pattern is basically identical to last year, but it is still top-tier."
7833,156,2,10.0,2022-01-18,traction,The foam is also the traction. It provides a suction-like feeling that keeps you gripped to the floor.
7834,156,6,9.0,2021-12-09,traction,I did not have any issues with the traction on the Curry 9s. It has an insane bite and allows for instant stops once you plant your feet on clean courts.
7835,156,1,10.0,2022-01-22,traction,The molded tread pattern is integrated right into the foam. It allows the tread to grab the court much better.
7836,156,7,9.0,2022-04-03,traction,"The traction is tacky and grippy. It bites hard, and you don't slide at all. It's honestly one of the better traction patterns on the market."
7837,156,32,9.0,2021-12-01,cushion,The Flow outsole feels more firm and responsive compared to last year's model. I also felt springy and bouncy at the same time. The only downside for me was that they are a bit too high off the ground.
7838,156,382,9.0,2022-03-06,cushion,The cushioning is also the same on the Curry 9 as the Curry 8. You feel low to the ground and responsive while still getting some needed impact protection.
7839,156,293,8.0,2021-12-19,cushion,"The Flow cushion is not the best in basketball shoes. However, it is responsive and provides plenty of court feel. The impact protection is also adequate."

7841,156,6,8.0,2021-12-09,cushion,The Flow cushion used provides a good amount of impact protection. It also has a great court feel and responsiveness.
7842,156,1,9.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The Flow cushion is designed to maintain push-off force and balance no matter the position of your feet. It's also lighter than most other cushions on the market.
7843,156,7,6.0,2022-04-03,cushion,"The Flow cushion is dense, and I didn't get much compression in the shoe. It is low to the ground and provides a ton of feedback. I like to have compression and impact protection in my shoes, so this isn't my preference."
7844,156,32,8.0,2021-12-01,materials,The materials are more sturdy and protective compared to last year's Curry 8s. There's also no break-in time as these are ready to go straight out of the box.
7845,156,382,9.0,2022-03-06,materials,The upper materials of the Curry 9 are better than the Curry 8. They are more structured but remain light and breathable.
7846,156,293,9.0,2021-12-19,materials,The Warp upper is thin and minimal. It feels premium and requires no break-in period.
7847,156,2,9.0,2022-01-18,materials,The UA Warp material used on the shoe is the best improvement on the 9s compared to the 8s.

7850,156,7,7.5,2022-04-03,materials,"The materials aren't the most premium, but I still enjoyed playing in them."
7851,156,32,9.0,2021-12-01,support,The support and lockdown are also improved this year due to the enhanced torsional support and revamped materials.
7852,156,382,9.5,2022-03-06,support,The shoe is surprisingly supportive. The wide outsole works with the cushion and materials to help you feel stable.
7853,156,293,9.0,2021-12-19,support,"For support and lockdown, the materials provide plenty of containment and stability."
7854,156,2,9.0,2022-01-18,support,"It has a wide base, and the materials keep you locked in. You feel locked in with this shoe."
7855,156,6,9.0,2021-12-09,support,I had absolutely no problems when it comes to the support and lockdown.
7856,156,1,8.0,2022-01-22,support,"Because of the lightness of the shoe and the foam under the big toe joint, more explosive players could find themselves rolling their ankles a bit. They perform much better for players that are lighter on their feet."
7857,156,7,9.0,2022-04-03,support,The lacing and weave on the upper provide a lot of structure to lock in your feet. The shoe offers a lot of support.
7858,156,32,8.0,2021-12-01,fit,The fit is much better this time around. Under Armour got rid of the extra toe box space I felt in the 8s.
7859,156,382,9.5,2022-03-06,fit,The shoe fits my foot comfortably. It isn't too snug and conforms to my foot nicely.
7860,156,293,9.0,2021-12-19,fit,Going true to size fits me like a glove. The materials conform to your foot nicely.
7861,156,2,8.0,2022-01-18,fit,"Due to the materials, these fit well. They don't stretch much so the fit provides a solid balance."
7862,156,6,9.0,2021-12-09,fit,I liked the fit going true to size. The materials have a decent amount of give to accommodate most regular-sized feet.
7863,156,1,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,"With the strength of the materials in the upper, the shoe really hugs and conforms to your foot."
7864,156,7,9.0,2022-04-03,fit,"For me, the shoe fit short. Once I got the right size, I felt good with the fit. It played well once it was on foot."
7865,156,382,100.0,2022-03-06,outdoor,"The durability fairs well, especially for being just a cushioning compound."
7866,156,293,100.0,2021-12-19,outdoor,"Take this with a grain of salt as I didn't take these outdoors, but I did take the 8s outdoors, and they held up well."
7867,156,1,50.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,"Flow foam itself is durable, but the tread depth may not be."
7868,156,293,2,2021-12-19,width,I would say these are slightly narrow.
7869,156,2,2,2022-01-18,width,Go half size up if you have a wide foot.
7870,156,1,2,2022-01-22,width,These are better suited for medium narrow feet but do break in width-wise with more play.
7871,156,7,3,2022-04-03,width,The shoe is semi-wide foot friendly.
7872,156,382,3,2022-03-06,size,"I went true to size, and it fits me perfectly."
7873,156,293,3,2021-12-19,size,"If you have a wider foot or prefer a roomier fit, I'd probably suggest going up half a size."
7874,156,2,3,2022-01-18,size,These fit true to size.
7875,156,6,3,2021-12-09,size,"I have a slightly wide foot, and I still felt perfect going true to size."
7876,156,1,3,2022-01-22,size,"If you have a high arch or long toes, you may want to go up half a size. Otherwise, they fit neutral."
7877,156,7,2,2022-04-03,size,I had to go up half a size.
7878,157,382,8.6,2022-02-22,expert_overall,"Overall, I think the performance of the Adidas Dame 8 will suit many players. The shoe definitely delivers as my only gripes were minor."
7879,157,6,8.4,2022-01-06,expert_overall,"Overall, the Adidas Dame 8 is a solid pickup at its current price point. The inconsistency with the traction is the only downside. The cushion is an improvement from last year and the fit and support were perfect."
7880,157,1,8.2,2022-01-22,expert_overall,The Adidas Dame 8 is a great pick for players looking for easy push-off power or stability for hard pivoting. They're also versatile as they play well on different surfaces and can accommodate many foot shapes.
7881,157,112,7.8,2022-01-08,expert_overall,"The Adidas Dame 8 could have been a strong performer but are held back by the traction. I had a lot of problems when it came to slippage. Other than that, the materials are comfortable, and the cushion provides a good amount of impact protection."
7882,157,394,7.8,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Dame 8 plays very similarly to the Dame 7 even with the slight changes made. Still a well-balanced shoe overall, nothing stands out in a good or bad way."
7883,157,293,7.4,2022-01-11,expert_overall,"The Adidas Dame 8's Bounce Pro cushion setup is a joy to play in. However, other aspects of the shoe, such as traction and fit, are too inconsistent for me to recommend these."
7884,157,19,7.2,2022-02-22,expert_overall,"I had high hopes for the Adidas Dame 8, but the traction didn't work for me, and the materials had a lot of room for improvement."
7885,157,420,9.7,2023-06-21,user_overall,"I don't play in an actual court, I use an outside one and I actually play good on it because of these shoes. Yeah they do collect dust easy but that's the only problem. I play as a small forward because I'm a pretty big guy and if you're a big i would suggest these, I'm not like a dunker i'm more of a shooting big. But even when i do dunk i feel damn good in these, the responsiveness is amazing too and it has good cushion but not too cushiony. They're a 9.7/10 for me."
7886,157,421,7.8,2023-01-14,user_overall,"I thought the Dame 8 would perform better. Traction was below average, collection dust really easily and you don't wanna use these outdoors. The Cushion was pretty good but the shoe was slightly long and a bit wide for my normal size (9.5 US Mens). The ankle support wasn't to great and the materials weren't to breathable."
7887,157,422,7.0,2023-05-10,user_overall,This shoe has great traction and does well on dusty floors. This shoe is not good for narrow feet they run wider than normal and they also run bigger than normal. So I’d definitely recommend you size down. The only thing I didn’t like about them is that it took awhile to brake them in.
7888,157,423,9.4,2023-02-02,user_overall,"The shoe is defiantly for a guard or a small forward. The grip is similar to the Kyrie Infinity. The acceleration is amazing, and the shoes allow you to fly. Also, good for shooting and driving. They're awesome for guard activities (generating points, handles, etc.)"
7889,157,258,8.6,2023-03-14,user_overall,The only downsight is the traction. Mine had a problem where the left shoe was slipping more than the right one even on clean court. Overall on clean courts you should be good but if you play on dusty courts I do not recommend them.
7890,157,382,9.0,2022-02-22,traction,The traction stuck to the court well for me. It bit really well to clean courts but picked up dust easily.
7891,157,6,8.0,2022-01-06,traction,"The Dame 8 features a modified herringbone pattern for the most part, and it performs alright. You won't have issues on clean courts, but mild dust can cause problems when making hard lateral movements."
7892,157,1,9.0,2022-01-22,traction,It has a surprisingly tacky feeling outsole. The tread pattern also allows the shoe to feel quick.
7893,157,112,6.0,2022-01-08,traction,The traction was not good at all. I slipped a lot even after breaking them in for a few hours.
7894,157,394,7.0,2022-01-22,traction,"The traction is definitely good, but maybe not great."
7895,157,293,6.0,2022-01-11,traction,"On a clean court, you won't have any problems. However, if the court is dusty, these were terrible. It's a dust magnet, and it takes a lot of effort to wipe."
7896,157,19,6.0,2022-02-22,traction,"The traction picks up dust regardless of the court conditions. It did not perform well for me, which was disappointing."
7897,157,382,9.0,2022-02-22,cushion,The cushion feels bouncy and soft. I enjoyed my time playing in this shoe.
7898,157,6,8.0,2022-01-06,cushion,Adidas is using a new setup they're calling Bounce Pro. It offers a lot of impact protection in the heel before tapering off into a more firm cushion in the forefoot. It feels more fluid than the Dame 7 setup.
7899,157,1,8.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The new Bounce Pro cushion used in the Dame 8 is an upgrade from regular Bounce. It feels denser than traditional Bounce while still feeling light compared to Boost.
7900,157,112,9.0,2022-01-08,cushion,"I was surprised by how nice the Bounce Pro felt. It provides a lot of impact protection and compression in the heel. It does get more firm in the forefoot, though."
7901,157,394,8.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The dual-density Bounce Pro cushion feels solid in a good way.
7902,157,293,8.0,2022-01-11,cushion,The Bounce Pro cushion has a lot of impact protection. It also feels soft yet bouncy.
7903,157,19,8.0,2022-02-22,cushion,"Adidas uses Bounce Pro in the Dame 8. The dual-density Bounce feels nice, but the shank plate makes it hard to flex the shoe."
7904,157,382,8.0,2022-02-22,materials,"Materials on the shoe aren't the most premium, but they get the job done."
7905,157,6,8.0,2022-01-06,materials,"There is a decent quality mesh used for the majority of the shoe. However, there are textiles mixed into the high wear areas."
7906,157,1,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,The upper on these Dames are some of the most rugged designs in recent years. The only concern is that toe dragging can wear away at the materials.
7907,157,112,8.0,2022-01-08,materials,"The materials feel solid. I had no issues, and they are comfortable on foot."
7908,157,394,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,"There is nothing super special about the materials, but it is light and breathable."
7909,157,293,8.0,2022-01-11,materials,A textile mesh makes up a majority of the shoe. The materials are soft and feel cozy on foot.
7910,157,19,8.0,2022-02-22,materials,"The materials look nice, but they could've been better support-wise. They performed decently enough, though."
7911,157,382,9.0,2022-02-22,support,I never had any issues with the support and lockdown. The heel counter and width of the shoe help keep you secure.
7912,157,6,9.0,2022-01-06,support,I had zero issues with support and lockdown. There were no issues with sliding on the footbed or heel slippage.
7913,157,1,9.0,2022-01-22,support,"They provide a strong stitched reinforcement. The heel lockdown allows for next to no heel slippage, but it causes these to feel long and boxy."
7914,157,112,8.0,2022-01-08,support,"I experienced a tad bit of heel slippage, but it didn't affect me at all once I started playing. Otherwise, I felt locked down."
7915,157,394,8.0,2022-01-22,support,I had no issues with the support. The cushion and upper combine to keep you contained.
7916,157,293,8.0,2022-01-11,support,I had no issues with lateral containment. Lateral stability was also good.
7917,157,19,7.0,2022-02-22,support,The upper of the shoe and lacing system did not have the support that I would've liked.
7918,157,382,8.0,2022-02-22,fit,"There is some extra length and room in the toe box that had me questioning the fit at times, but overall it was good."
7919,157,6,9.0,2022-01-06,fit,The Dame 8 is more accomodating than last year's model. I didn't experience any type of tightness or pressure with these.
7920,157,1,7.0,2022-01-22,fit,The fit is the biggest con of the shoe. They fit generously because of the space in the toe box area.
7921,157,112,8.0,2022-01-08,fit,I had no issues at all when it came to the fit of the Adidas Dame 8.
7922,157,394,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,The shoe has a little too much room towards the front of the shoe.
7923,157,293,7.0,2022-01-11,fit,"The fit was not the best for me. There was too much room in the toe box area, and it does stretch out after breaking in."
7924,157,19,7.0,2022-02-22,fit,"Similar to other Adidas shoes, the forefoot area could be more secure. The shoe was also roomy in the toe box in terms of length."
7925,157,1,50.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,They're one of the better shoes on the market for combined outdoor and indoor play.
7926,157,394,50.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,I tested these outdoors and didn't see a lot of fraying.
7927,157,293,50.0,2022-01-11,outdoor,"The grooves are thick, and the rubber looks like it could hold up."
7928,157,6,4,2022-01-06,width,"I have a slightly wide foot, and going down half a size was not an issue for me."
7929,157,1,3,2022-01-22,width,"The toe box accommodates narrow, medium, and wide widths."
7930,157,394,3,2022-01-22,width,
7931,157,293,4,2022-01-11,width,I would say these are slightly wide.
7932,157,6,4,2022-01-06,size,I would say that these run half a size big.
7933,157,1,4,2022-01-22,size,"If you have a narrow foot or short toes, I would be going down half a size."
7934,157,112,3,2022-01-08,size,I went true to size and had no issues.
7935,157,394,4,2022-01-22,size,I would suggest going down half a size.
7936,157,293,4,2022-01-11,size,"These run long, so I would suggest going down half a size."
7937,158,293,7.6,2021-11-25,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie Flytrap 5 is a responsive and lightweight shoe. The traction is solid when on clean courts, and the cushion performs well enough for players that play low to the ground."
7938,158,6,7.6,2021-12-01,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie Flytrap 5 is a solid budget shoe for anyone who likes to play in a firmer and more responsive shoe. Almost all aspects performed adequately, but I wish the cushion and fit were better."
7939,158,394,7.6,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Kyrie Flytrap 5 gives you about what you can expect from a shoe that is $90. The traction and cushion aren't anything special, but the support holds up well to play in."
7940,158,348,5.0,2022-03-02,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie Flytrap 5 is a shoe that I can only recommend to wide-footers who enjoy minimal cushioning. For everybody else, there are a lot of better shoes out there."
7941,158,424,6.8,2023-07-15,user_overall,"These shoes were good for just one year after a while they started to get holes in them on the sides so if you make quick cuts and move a lot I dont recommend these shoes, but traction were alright not the best, they weren’t that comfortable and materials are pretty bad and the shock absorption is not great at all."
7942,158,425,8.8,2023-04-21,user_overall,"The shoes are almost perfect. Insane traction, they look good and very light. But the materials are bad. The shoes started to look bad very fast and on the sides the fabric started to rip off. The shoes are very tight"
7943,158,426,7.0,2023-04-15,user_overall,For guards that wont find themselves around the rim it is an amazing shoe however as soon as you approach the rim you have a huge disadvantage probably worse than wearing regular trainers for cushion and bounce
7944,158,427,6.6,2023-04-26,user_overall,if the cushioning was better these would be a great pair. good for light guards that dont care about impact protection and like being low to the ground in their shoes.
7945,158,428,9.7,2022-03-24,user_overall,"Super happy with this shoe. At the 70$ price point there is nothing to complain about. Best shoe I've ever had? No, but for the price I am super pleased."
7946,158,293,8.0,2021-11-25,traction,"On a clean court, the bite on the traction is solid. It does get a little bad on dust, though. I experienced some sliding out when it came time to make hard stops."
7947,158,6,8.0,2021-12-01,traction,"The pattern on the traction is the exact same as the Flytrap 4. It performs well on clean courts, but dusty courts can cause sliding if you don't wipe."
7948,158,394,6.0,2022-01-22,traction,"For the price, the traction is alright. It's nothing special. The grooves don't offer much in terms of bite and stickiness."
7949,158,348,5.0,2022-03-02,traction,"When clean, the traction worked well. With dust, the shoe did slide."
7950,158,293,7.0,2021-11-25,cushion,"The full-length Phylon bottoms out quickly. They also have a small Zoom unit in the forefoot. It's noticeable, but it doesn't provide the most bouncy experience."
7951,158,6,7.0,2021-12-01,cushion,"The cushion feels just like the previous Flytrap model as well. The Phylon is stiff and doesn't feel nice on foot. You can feel a subtle bounce from the Zoom unit in the forefoot, though."
7952,158,394,7.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"The shoe has a forefoot Zoom Air unit, but the shoe does not feel soft at all. It does offer decent responsiveness, though."
7953,158,348,5.0,2022-03-02,cushion,"The midsole is thin with minimal compression. I found it hard to feel any bounciness, even with the Zoom Air unit in the forefoot."
7954,158,293,7.0,2021-11-25,materials,"The materials quality is not the best. They are minimal and lightweight, though."
7955,158,6,8.0,2021-12-01,materials,"The mesh material feels cheap, but they get the job done just fine."
7956,158,394,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,"The materials don't feel premium, but they are light and breathable."
7957,158,348,5.0,2022-03-02,materials,"The materials on the Kyrie Flytrap 5 feel okay at best. Nike does use an interesting mix of materials, though."
7958,158,293,8.0,2021-11-25,support,"There were no issues with support and lockdown. The containment is solid as always, and the stability, surprisingly, gave me no issues either."
7959,158,6,8.0,2021-12-01,support,I didn't have any issues with support in the Flytrap 5. No feel slippage and no sliding on the footbed either.
7960,158,394,9.0,2022-01-22,support,The shoe grips your foot nicely and makes you feel secure.
7961,158,348,5.0,2022-03-02,support,"The support suffers because of the issues caused by the fit. There's no outrigger, and the materials do not contain your foot laterally. I even rolled my ankle in these shoes."
7962,158,293,8.0,2021-11-25,fit,It fits exactly the same as the Nike Kyrie Flytrap 4. The mesh material does stretch out a bit over time.
7963,158,6,7.0,2021-12-01,fit,"I felt a lot of pressure on the lateral portion of the shoe, especially around the midfoot area. The materials don't stretch much, so you'll need to make sure you get the right size."
7964,158,394,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,"The shoe is easy to move around in, and it conforms to your foot nicely."
7965,158,348,5.0,2022-03-02,fit,The fit is the worst aspect of the shoe; there is too much dead space in the forefoot. The extra room creates too many issues with your feet sliding around.
7966,158,293,100.0,2021-11-25,outdoor,They look durable based on the rubber compound.
7967,158,394,50.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,
7968,158,394,2,2022-01-22,width,The shoe fits narrower than regular shoes.
7969,158,6,2,2021-12-01,size,"I went true to size as a wide-footer, and I would suggest going up half a size if you have wide feet."
7970,158,394,3,2022-01-22,size,"If you like to have some extra room in your shoe or you have a wider foot, I'd suggest going up half a size."
7971,159,382,8.9,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 19 has plenty of tech and provides the best impact protection you can find right now. However, the traction can be suspect, and they are heavy."
7972,159,2,8.8,2021-11-19,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 19 is one of the best shoes in the LeBron line in recent years. The cushioning setup is lower to the ground without sacrificing any impact protection, but the biggest improvement is the stability that they feature."
7973,159,112,8.5,2021-12-13,expert_overall,The Nike LeBron 19 doesn't quite fit my playstyle. They do provide impact protection and would be a solid pick for players that enjoy extra cushioning.
7974,159,293,8.4,2021-12-09,expert_overall,"Overall, the Nike LeBron 19 is a fun shoe to play in. It provides a crazy amount of bounce, and the cushion feels fantastic. The traction and weight do hold the shoe back, though."
7975,159,1,8.4,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 19 offers a lot of tech, especially in the mid and outsole. It's a maximalist shoe that provides plenty of energy return, but it may not be the best shoe for those that rely on speed up and down the court because of the weight."
7976,159,32,8.0,2021-12-13,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 19 provides an unreal cushioning experience in terms of comfort, but the traction is disappointing. They remain one of the best shoes for those that value impact protection."
7977,159,6,8.0,2022-01-13,expert_overall,"Not even the crazy cushion and improved support of the LeBron 19 could make me recommend this shoe. For the price, the traction is just not good."
7978,159,7,7.7,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"Overall, I can't recommend the Nike LeBron 19 because of the traction. If you need an awesome cushion setup with a lot of support, this shoe could work for you."
7979,159,429,9.5,2022-01-10,user_overall,"Most fun hooping shoe EVER! With the exception of the materials, this does everything better than the 18. Traction is tacky, materials are good, the stability is so much better than the 18, and the fit is like a glove, But that cushion. I wish i could give it a 45/10. This is the best cushion I have EVER felt in a shoe. I jump like 15 more inches with this. Overall one the best shoes i’ve ever played in."
7980,159,430,9.5,2022-10-09,user_overall,"I really love the LeBron 19. The cushion on this shoe is the best i've ever felt on my feet. They fit perfectly and the lockdown is crazy. These shoes are so bouncy, they literally made me jump higher. I couldnt even touch the ring without him, but after i got em on it was so easy and consistent. The traction isnt the best but definitely playable. All in all this is a superb shoe!"
7981,159,372,6.0,2022-07-10,user_overall,"It bites ok on a clean court but on a dusty court is awful it has a bad fit. The only positive is the cushion which is top tier and the support which is great.I personally didn't like that much cause it's hight top(I only like low tops) and it was bulky.But if u don't mind the high too issue and u are a LeBron fan go for it, It's also a nice upgrade over the last year's shoe."
7982,159,68,8.4,2023-10-23,user_overall,"Parece que meu pé está usando uma armadura, pisada larga e com um suporte incrível, porém é pesado! tração dele as vezes deixa a desejar por escorregar em algum momento, certamente não serve para outdoor, amortecimento excelente de tecnologia, esquenta bastante os pés, respirabilidade poderia ser melhor, a ponta do cano alto danificou minhas meias"
7983,159,431,7.8,2023-05-07,user_overall,I recommend this shoe for non shifty players. This shoe is absolutely not built to do quick changes of direction. The Traction is besides the weight the worst part about the shoe. U dont really slip but you dont get a real bite either. The cushioning itself is great but because the shoe’s so heavy i personally dont really feel bouncy.
7984,159,382,8.0,2022-01-22,traction,"The traction performs well on clean courts. However, on dustier courts, it slips and slides with regularity."
7985,159,2,8.0,2021-11-19,traction,"It isn't squeaky or tacky, but the shoe grips on both clean and dusty courts."
7986,159,112,8.0,2021-12-13,traction,"I have heard the traction is inconsistent, but it wasn't bad for me. I had no issues on both clean and dusty courts."
7987,159,293,7.0,2021-12-09,traction,"On clean courts, it has good enough traction. Dusty courts, on the other hand, cause this traction to perform poorly. It was hard to get any sort of grip."
7988,159,1,8.0,2022-01-22,traction,The traction sometimes doesn't grip and grips too hard at other times. This isn't much of an issue of clean hardwood courts but could be an issue elsewhere.
7989,159,32,6.0,2021-12-13,traction,"They are subpar and don't get the job done at a high level. I struggled to get a grip when moving laterally, especially."
7990,159,6,6.0,2022-01-13,traction,"The LeBron 19 features a micro-engineered blade traction pattern that does not perform well. It's fine on clean courts. On dustier courts, you're going to have problems."
7991,159,7,6.0,2022-01-22,traction,"The traction consists of nubs in the shape of crowns. It performed well when going front to back, but anything laterally, you're going to slide."
7992,159,382,9.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The cushioning feels bouncy and plush. It provides a lot of impact protection because there is so much air.
7993,159,2,10.0,2021-11-19,cushion,There is an Air Max unit in the back and a Zoom Air unit in the forefoot. The carrier foam is Cushlon and it feels amazing. The setup is also lower to the ground this year which is very welcomed.
7994,159,112,9.0,2021-12-13,cushion,"These are one of the craziest cushion setups I've ever felt. The step-in comfort is fantastic, and the Zoom Air feels bouncy."
7995,159,293,9.0,2021-12-09,cushion,"The cushion setup is insane. The forefoot Zoom unit is bouncy, and there is lots of impact protection. It's a very comfortable shoe."
7996,159,1,10.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"The Air Max in the rear isn't the most stable, but it is large. However, the design of the cushion that transfers air underneath the foot does a great job of providing more force and explosion."
7997,159,32,10.0,2021-12-13,cushion,"For my personal playstyle, the cushion feels excessive. However, they do feel unbelievable in a good way. They provide ample impact protection, and the forefoot feels extra bouncy."
7998,159,6,9.0,2022-01-13,cushion,"In the heel, there's a giant Air Max unit. There's also a large Zoom unit in the forefoot. Strictly from a cushion setup, this feels crazy. It doesn't quite fit my playstyle, though."
7999,159,7,8.5,2022-01-22,cushion,"The cushioning is pretty good; it does sit high off the ground, though. I enjoyed the impact protection that it provides."
8000,159,382,9.0,2022-01-22,materials,The materials are soft and supportive. There really isn't anything for me to complain about.
8001,159,2,9.0,2021-11-19,materials,"The materials are a hybrid of mesh and ripstop. In terms of performance, it gets the job done. I loved playing with these materials."
8002,159,112,8.0,2021-12-13,materials,"The materials were unique, especially the tongue portion of the shoe. The shoe is comfortable straight out of the box."
8003,159,293,9.0,2021-12-09,materials,"The mesh materials are pliable and soft. It feels great on foot, and I like how thin it is."
8004,159,1,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,The materials used for the tongue started out feeling annoying. It did break in with play. The rest of the upper feels plush and performs well.
8005,159,32,8.0,2021-12-13,materials,"The materials do not live up to the standard of being a high-profile shoe. In terms of performance, they are better than the LeBron 18, though. They're lighter and more breathable."
8006,159,6,8.0,2022-01-13,materials,"The materials are not as premium feeling as the previous 2 LeBron models. In terms of performance, it does get the job done."
8007,159,7,7.0,2022-01-22,materials,"The materials are super durable, but the biggest downfall is that they aren't breathable."
8008,159,382,9.5,2022-01-22,support,The shoe keeps you secure on the footbed with the TPU wings and outrigger.
8009,159,2,9.0,2021-11-19,support,I had no issues with lateral containment. Heel lockdown and support are solid on these. I had no slippage whatsoever. There's also an outrigger!
8010,159,112,9.0,2021-12-13,support,"Surprisingly, the support felt good. It was much better than I was expecting from the shoe. You feel very safe, and my ankles feel secure."
8011,159,293,9.0,2021-12-09,support,"For lateral containment, the shoe provides tons of support and stability. I had zero issues with the LeBron 19."
8012,159,1,8.0,2022-01-22,support,"The wings used on the sides of the shoe keep your feet contained. It also performs well in smaller spaces. However, at higher speeds, it can be tough to control."
8013,159,32,9.0,2021-12-13,support,The support and stability are improved compared to last year's model. The lateral cages on the sides of the shoe and the lacing system work together to keep you from feeling wobbly.
8014,159,6,9.0,2022-01-13,support,"Nike improved the sliding on the footbed that I felt on the LeBron 18. I had no issues with containment or slippage with the 19, and there was no sliding at all. Huge upgrade."
8015,159,7,9.0,2022-01-22,support,The TPU wings on the shoe harness your foot when you make lateral movements. The support is fantastic overall.
8016,159,382,9.0,2022-01-22,fit,"The fit started out narrow and a tiny bit long, but I just needed to adjust the lacing to get a tailored 1-to-1 fit."
8017,159,2,8.0,2021-11-19,fit,I had no issues with the fit on the shoe.
8018,159,293,8.0,2021-12-09,fit,The length of the shoe was perfect for my needs. It's also a pretty snug toe box.
8019,159,1,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,The Nike LeBron 19 has a unique fit because of the high top and materials.
8020,159,32,8.0,2021-12-13,fit,"They feel snug at first, but after breaking them in, they loosen up nicely."
8021,159,6,8.0,2022-01-13,fit,The shoe fits snugly and felt good other than the tight fit caused by the midfoot cage.
8022,159,7,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,"The fit starts out feeling narrow, but it does conform to your foot the more you play. I didn't like how high the collar is; it rubs into your ankle uncomfortably."
8023,159,382,0.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,I would not take these outdoors. I experienced fraying from playing indoors.
8024,159,2,50.0,2021-11-19,outdoor,The traction on my Asian release version is durable.
8025,159,112,0.0,2021-12-13,outdoor,I would not take these outdoors.
8026,159,293,0.0,2021-12-09,outdoor,The rubber seems much too soft to hold up outdoors.
8027,159,1,100.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,The outsole is on the more durable end of the spectrum.
8028,159,293,2,2021-12-09,width,"If you have a wide foot or like to have some room in the toe box, I would suggest going up half a size."
8029,159,1,2,2022-01-22,width,"Unless you like a snug fit, you should go up half a size if you have a wider foot."
8030,159,6,3,2022-01-13,width,"If you have wider feet, the midfoot area might feel tight."
8031,159,7,3,2022-01-22,width,It feels narrow but stretches out over time.
8032,159,2,3,2021-11-19,size,Go true to size if you had a regular foot. Consider going half a size up if you have a wide foot.
8033,159,293,3,2021-12-09,size,True to size fits me extremely well.
8034,159,1,3,2022-01-22,size,"If you have a narrow or medium-sized foot, these are gonna fit great."
8035,159,6,3,2022-01-13,size,I would say the LeBron 19 does run true to size.
8036,159,7,3,2022-01-22,size,"The shoe does fit true to size, so get your regular size."
8037,160,6,8.0,2021-11-14,expert_overall,"The Jordan One Take 3 is a solid pickup for the price. In my opinion, it is the best One Take model yet. The traction bites hard, and the cushion setup performs well for the price range."
8038,160,293,8.0,2021-11-19,expert_overall,I really enjoyed playing in the Jordan One Take 3. They felt like an extension of my foot with the grippy traction and responsive cushion. The materials are also minimal and support and lockdown were not an issue at all.
8039,160,281,8.2,2023-04-18,user_overall,Very good budget shoe. I loved the cushion on this shoe because of the zoom unit in the forefoot which provided bounce and impact protection. the traction was good on clean courts but picked up some dust on dusty courts but it was easy to wipe. the shoe fits true to size and is not too narrow or too wide. I had no issue with heel slippage. my only issue with the shoe is that the break in period is painful and hurt my feet. other than that this shoe is an amazing budget preformer.
8040,160,432,8.0,2022-10-03,user_overall,"Everything is really good about this shoe besides the materials, they have a lot of plastic and you will have no ventilation but if u don't care ab that then it's the shoe for you.(also top tier shoe for the price)"
8041,160,433,8.7,2023-05-25,user_overall,"Pros: a very responsive shoe, low to the ground. Pretty good traction"
8042,160,434,9.2,2022-08-22,user_overall,An amazing budget shoe which is definitely worth the price. If your looking for a shoe that isn't going to break your bank but is also a solid performer this is the go to.
8043,160,435,8.2,2022-08-26,user_overall,"Overall good shoes, and nice aesthetics. They work for all types of players but the insole will lose the logo making it impossible to resell"
8044,160,6,9.0,2021-11-14,traction,The traction on this shoe works very well on both clean and dusty courts. It only needs a small amount of wiping to control the dust pickup.
8045,160,293,8.0,2021-11-19,traction,"On a clean court, the shoe has a nice stop and bite to it. On a dusty court, it picks up dust quickly but is easy to wipe."
8046,160,6,8.0,2021-11-14,cushion,"For the price, the cushioning setup is surprisingly good. You get a bit of impact protection, and you can actually feel the Zoom unit in the forefoot."
8047,160,293,8.0,2021-11-19,cushion,"The cushioning setup is one of my favourite parts of the shoe. The Phylon provides adequate impact protection in the heel. In the forefoot, the Zoom unit feels responsive and provides a slight bouncing feeling."
8048,160,6,7.0,2021-11-14,materials,"The plastic shell provides added durability to the shoe. Underneath the plastic is a mesh-like lining, and the combination of these materials performs well."
8049,160,293,8.0,2021-11-19,materials,"The materials feel like plastic, but it doesn't take away from the performance. They feel soft on foot and are thin and lightweight."
8050,160,6,8.0,2021-11-14,support,There were no problems with support and lockdown. It has all the needed features to keep your foot secure.
8051,160,293,8.0,2021-11-19,support,I had no issues with support. The materials on the lateral side provide solid containment for your foot. Stability was also no issue for me.
8052,160,6,8.0,2021-11-14,fit,"I had no issue with the fit. There was a slight pressure near my pinky toe, but nothing serious."
8053,160,293,8.0,2021-11-19,fit,"The shoe fits snugly. If you don't enjoy that type of fit, go up half a size."
8054,160,293,50.0,2021-11-19,outdoor,"The rubber is soft on the non-herringbone pattern but is decent on the herringbone pattern. Durability could be okay for outdoors, but not the best."
8055,160,293,2,2021-11-19,width,I would say it is slightly narrower than normal.
8056,160,293,3,2021-11-19,size,I went true to size and it fits really well.
8057,161,307,7.8,2022-06-06,expert_overall,"Overall, the Nike LeBron Witness 6 is comfortable and gets the job done for the price. It's a good option for outdoor play."
8058,161,1,7.6,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron Witness 6 has a lot of stability enhancements this year, but it can still be a bit unstable. However, this is a great shoe to beat up on outdoor courts."
8059,161,293,7.2,2021-10-25,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron Witness 6 is a step down from the previous model in the Witness line. The shoe's instability combined with the underperforming traction leaves much to be desired. Even for the $100 price point, I can't recommend this shoe."
8060,161,6,7.2,2021-11-10,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron Witness 6 is not a shoe I can recommend, even at its lower price point. The traction works well, but the lateral stability and cushion are lacking."
8061,161,112,7.0,2021-11-02,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron Witness 6 is a great-looking shoe, and can definitely be worn casually. However, I cannot recommend it for playing basketball. The cushion feels unstable and not supportive underfoot."
8062,161,414,9.0,2023-04-15,user_overall,The cushion is pretty stiff but that’s the only weakness. I loved the witness 5 and the witness 6 is a small but noticeable upgrade it feels super light and has great traction. I don’t think I‘ve ever worn a shoe with better support than the witness 6. They are a bit hard to get on (I’d recommend a shoe horn) but even without great cushion they feel great.
8063,161,436,8.7,2022-07-13,user_overall,I bought 2 pairs of this shoe the Lakers colorway and the navy blue colorway.The Lakers color were too small in the same size as the navy but the navy were great so idk what is wrong with somethings about this shoe but it is good. Buy the witness 5s over these.
8064,161,437,8.5,2023-02-20,user_overall,"The traction seemed pretty tacky once broken in. This shoe is slightly bulkier, so is a great post player option, but could be a good option for a guard too. It has great cushioning and impact protection too. Overall a fun shoe."
8065,161,438,7.0,2023-05-03,user_overall,"solid durability, decent price. I beat the shit out of them playing in the street though so they only lasted a couple of months"
8066,161,439,7.6,2023-04-27,user_overall,"I know this is one of the cheaper lebron shoes,but this is just an overall mid shoe as I give it a 7/10"
8067,161,307,7.0,2022-06-06,traction,"Overall, the traction didn't perform as well as I'd like because it collected more dust than expected."
8068,161,1,8.0,2022-01-22,traction,The full-length herringbone makes it so that the shoe doesn't slip out from under you often. One thing to note is that it performs better outdoors than indoors.
8069,161,293,6.0,2021-10-25,traction,"Despite being full-length herringbone, the traction does not perform well. It takes a long time to break-in. It has an alright bite on clean courts, but it doesn't bite at all on the dusty courts."
8070,161,6,8.0,2021-11-10,traction,"The LeBron 6 features full-length herringbone, and it performed nicely for me. It did pick up dust on dustier courts and felt a bit slippery."
8071,161,112,8.0,2021-11-02,traction,The traction was very good for me.
8072,161,307,8.0,2022-06-06,cushion,The shoe is comfortable from the moment you put it on.
8073,161,1,7.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"The Air Max doesn't give you the best ground feel, but the forefoot foam helps to counteract this."
8074,161,293,7.0,2021-10-25,cushion,"The full-length Air Max does not feel too great. Although I will admit, I'm just not a fan of Air Max units. It feels heavy, and the impact protection isn't the best."
8075,161,6,7.0,2021-11-10,cushion,"I would say the cushion is not that great. The Air Max unit feels stiff, and it does not compress much in high-impact areas."
8076,161,112,6.0,2021-11-02,cushion,"The cushion is comfortable, and I could feel the Air Max unit when walking. However, your forefoot does not feel supported when playing.  I actually had to stop playing because of the pain I felt in my forefoot."
8077,161,307,8.0,2022-06-06,materials,"The shoe feels much lighter on my foot than I thought it would. In terms of breathability, the materials could've been better."
8078,161,1,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,"The materials are light, airy, and breathable without giving up much durability."
8079,161,293,8.0,2021-10-25,materials,"The mesh is flimsy, but it does feel comfortable though. For performance purposes, I had no issues."
8080,161,6,7.0,2021-11-10,materials,"The textile used in the upper part of the shoe is thin, but you don't really notice it on foot. Perfectly fine for the price point."
8081,161,112,8.0,2021-11-02,materials,"The material around the ankle area can dig into your skin if you don't wear higher socks. The mesh looks like it will hold up well, especially for being a budget model."
8082,161,307,8.0,2022-06-06,support,"The shoe has decent ankle support, but it's not necessarily the best. It'll get the job done, though."
8083,161,1,8.0,2022-01-22,support,The lacing setup and heel counter of the shoe offer solid stability.
8084,161,293,7.0,2021-10-25,support,"The lateral containment was solid, but lateral stability was lacking. Your foot is high off the ground because of the Air Max unit, and the base is not wide enough to compensate for this."
8085,161,6,6.0,2021-11-10,support,"I had no issues with the heel stability and containment. The lateral stability, on the other hand, was not good. The cushion on the lateral side of the shoe compressed and caused me to feel unstable."
8086,161,112,6.0,2021-11-02,support,I felt locked down in the heel area. The only issue I had is that I don't think there is enough air pressure in the cushion to be supportive. The shoe could've benefitted from a larger outrigger.
8087,161,1,7.0,2022-01-22,fit,The tongue comes up so high that it can cause the laces to dig into your foot.
8088,161,293,8.0,2021-10-25,fit,"I went true to size, and it fits me well."
8089,161,6,8.0,2021-11-10,fit,"The material does break in to provide a better fit. I only felt slight pinching by my pinky toe area. If you have very wide feet, consider sizing up half a size."
8090,161,307,50.0,2022-06-06,outdoor,This shoe may be better suited for outdoor play.
8091,161,1,100.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,"Finally, a shoe that can excel on outdoor court surfaces."
8092,161,293,100.0,2021-10-25,outdoor,"The shoe uses a hard rubber compound, and the grooves are thick. They should be good for outdoor use considering the price."
8093,161,293,2,2021-10-25,width,I would say the width ranges from slightly narrow to normal.
8094,161,6,2,2021-11-10,width,"They are a little narrow, but even with my slightly wide foot, they felt fine."
8095,161,112,2,2021-11-02,width,"If you have wide feet, you might want to go up half a size."
8096,161,1,4,2022-01-22,size,The sizing on this shoe is fairly generous. You might be able to go down half a size.
8097,161,293,3,2021-10-25,size,"There is a little bit of space in the forefoot area, but not enough to make me want to size down."
8098,161,6,3,2021-11-10,size,I would say they run true to size.
8099,162,307,8.9,2022-06-06,expert_overall,"For the price, this is one of the better shoes I've played in this year. I was surprised at just how well the traction performed."
8100,162,112,8.3,2022-03-09,expert_overall,"Overall, I would recommend the Nike Air Max Impact 3 for anybody in the market for a budget sneaker. The only downside is that the impact protection could be better."
8101,162,6,8.0,2022-03-09,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Max Impact 3 is just okay for the price. It's personally not my favourite, but I'd say go for it if you are a fan of Air Max units and strong traction."
8102,162,214,7.6,2023-03-31,user_overall,"The traction and durability make this a good option for an outdoor shoe. The Air Max unit in the heel provides good impact protection, but the front of the shoe is very stiff. They are good for wide footers. The biggest issue is the ankle collar. They really dig in and feel uncomfortable. They fixed this issue in the 4th model."
8103,162,217,8.0,2023-08-03,user_overall,"Traction is really good on clean courts, on dust you have to wipe often.You have to break it in and it is very durable. Support is decent and cushion is average, nothing make me said wow. The materials are good. Very good for outdoor because of his durable traction pattern."
8104,162,440,8.2,2023-09-19,user_overall,Shoe would be better if the part in the heel and the side of the heel was a little softer the material used made my feet hurt alot in the heel part but overall shoe is great for everything.
8105,162,441,8.9,2022-04-10,user_overall,Me encanta dura mucho tiempo en su se usaron interior y en exterior y si juegas en una posición exterior te va a ir genial
8106,162,442,8.8,2022-11-17,user_overall,AMI 3 is my 2
8107,162,307,10.0,2022-06-06,traction,"The traction is great, and the shoe only moves where I move. It performed on dusty courts too."
8108,162,112,9.0,2022-03-09,traction,The traction performed phenomenally. I had no issues with slipping out or losing grip.
8109,162,6,9.0,2022-03-09,traction,"The traction pattern used is herringbone, and it performs just as you'd expect. You might have to wipe occasionally, but the traction bites really well."
8110,162,307,8.0,2022-06-06,cushion,I was impressed with the impact protection of the Air unit. The shoe felt soft and comfortable when playing.
8111,162,112,8.0,2022-03-09,cushion,"The foam and Air Max unit feel firm, so the shoe isn't the best for impact protection."
8112,162,6,7.0,2022-03-09,cushion,"The Air Max unit in the heel offers some impact protection, but it isn't the best."
8113,162,112,8.0,2022-03-09,materials,"It's a low-budget sneaker, so the padding isn't the greatest. However, it still feels comfortable."
8114,162,6,8.0,2022-03-09,materials,"The mesh used is cheap-feeling. However, it does get the job done for performance."
8115,162,307,9.5,2022-06-06,support,"My ankle felt incredibly supported, and I felt stable in the shoe."
8116,162,112,8.0,2022-03-09,support,I felt really stable in this shoe. I had no issues with support and lockdown.
8117,162,6,8.0,2022-03-09,support,The shoe actually has pretty good support. The lateral cage does a good job of keeping your foot on the footbed.
8118,162,307,8.0,2022-06-06,fit,"The shoe fits snug to start, but after playing in them for about thirty minutes, the fit loosened up."
8119,162,6,8.0,2022-03-09,fit,"The shoe fits well for the most part, but the rubber wings on the sides of the shoe can potentially cause pressure."
8120,162,6,100.0,2022-03-09,outdoor,"I didn't take these shoes outdoors, but the rubber compound is hard."
8121,162,6,3,2022-03-09,size,I would say that the Air Max Impact 3 does run true to size.
8122,163,7,9.4,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"Overall, the Jordan 36 might be my favourite basketball shoe to play in right now. The traction is one of the best on the market and responsive cushioning."
8123,163,7,9.3,2022-05-22,expert_overall,"The Jordan 36 is a fantastic overall shoe. It offers traction, support, and cushioning. I don't think you can go wrong, especially considering the materials."
8124,163,293,9.2,2021-09-13,expert_overall,"The Jordan 36 is one of my favourite shoes to play in right now. They're lightweight, they have a nice bite, and I love the cushion setup."
8125,163,33,9.1,2021-09-13,expert_overall,"The latest entry in the Air Jordan line is a strong performer, just like the previous two models. The full-length Zoom Air Strobel is amazing. The traction is outstanding. Materials are durable. There really aren't any downsides to this shoe."
8126,163,32,9.0,2021-09-13,expert_overall,"Jordan brand continues to deliver with the 36. The traction is consistent. There's plenty of impact protection, and the materials make it incredibly lightweight. It's a strong performer overall."
8127,163,1,9.0,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"Compared to many other releases this year, the Jordan 36 is a stand-out shoe. The shoe gives you a lot of push-off power and performance. The only downside is that the comfort doesn't keep up with the excellent performance."
8128,163,6,9.0,2022-04-15,expert_overall,"The Air Jordan 36 is a great performer. It's fun and bouncy, and I can't get enough of the cushion setup."
8129,163,321,8.5,2021-11-03,expert_overall,"Overall, the Jordan 36 is a great shoe for big men and forwards. It provides impact protection, and there really aren't any major issues with the traction."
8130,163,443,9.4,2023-07-13,user_overall,"These are the first real performance basketball shoes I bought when I started getting back into basketball and they didn’t disappoint at all, the Leno-weave upper allows for great breathability while also maintaining the support and strength the Jordan 37’s Leno-weave couldn’t recreate in the next model (Grant Williams). The cushioning is great but if you have any type of bunion I have heard it can pinch at your knuckles, I didn’t personally have that experience but I have heard it can happen."
8131,163,444,9.3,2022-01-31,user_overall,"The bounciest feeling ZoomAir forefoot I have ever experienced! Shoe is super light weight, cushioning is responsive yet offers good impact absorption. Went true-to-size, the last is very tight in the toebox, but runs long lengthwise. I have about 5mm of dead space in front my big toe. The fit improves after few hours, making the shoe feel roomier and softer. Grip is nice. Only 2 small issues I have noticed so far - there is bit of heel slippage and also shoe makes squeaking noises at forefoot."
8132,163,445,9.0,2023-05-31,user_overall,"Great shoe,got it for 112 bucks, awesome traction, very comfortable cushioning setup,lockdown and support are best I will ever feel, looks amazing and its really one of the highest technology shoes for basketball probably ever in terms of absolutely everything(cushion,materials,lockdown,lightweight that still puts overall performance on very top of basketball shoes probably of all time) If you can find it for fair price get it right away(retail is very high,but on sale is pretty decent) AWESOME!"
8133,163,446,9.4,2022-06-29,user_overall,"When you put these on, you can instantly tell they are quality basketball shoes. The best aspects of the Jordan 35 are the cushion, because of it’s plate; and the materials, that feel premium and comfortable. I tested the traction on hardwood floors and it was almost perfect. The main downside I see in the Jordan 36 is the weight. They definitely feel heavier than most other shoes I tried. But even heavier than that i"
8134,163,447,10.0,2022-01-11,user_overall,"Although the width of this shoe is slightly narrow, the Air Jordan 36 is everything I want in a basketball shoe and in an Air Jordan, no less! A sleek, formfitting, super light upper from the lenoweave with awesome breathability and a minimalistic approach. Followed by a zoom strobel/unlocked forefoot zoom air combo that gives a hell of a bounce. Tried and true traction that grips pretty well. Finally, exceptional lockdown and support that keeps your foot locked in! Gonna get another pair!"
8135,163,7,9.0,2022-01-22,traction,"The herringbone pattern on the Jordan 36 offers fantastic traction on basically every court, clean or dirty."
8136,163,7,9.0,2022-05-22,traction,"The traction collects quite a bit of dust, but it is very tacky. Not a lot of gripes when it comes to traction."
8137,163,293,10.0,2021-09-13,traction,"On clean courts, the traction has a phenomenal bite. It picks up dust on dirtier courts, but it still performs well regardless."
8138,163,33,9.5,2021-09-13,traction,The Air Jordan 36 has amazing traction. They perform fantastic on all types of courts and dirt was not a problem.
8139,163,32,9.0,2021-09-13,traction,The traction works well and makes me feel quick on my feet.
8140,163,1,9.0,2022-01-22,traction,The traction works well in combination with the materials and the cushioning to keep you secure when moving on the court.
8141,163,6,9.0,2022-04-15,traction,The herringbone traction performed really well. You'll have no problems making shifty movements and stopping on a dime. It even performed well on mildly dusty courts.
8142,163,321,7.8,2021-11-03,traction,"The full-length herringbone traction performs well overall. However, it can bit a bit inconsistent. For the most part, when playing I didn't notice any issues with the traction."
8143,163,7,9.5,2022-01-22,cushion,The cushioning is incredible. The double-stacked Zoom Air in the forefoot feels amazing.
8144,163,7,9.5,2022-05-22,cushion,The cushion is lightweight and springy. I absolutely love the Zoom Strobel and the insole as well.
8145,163,293,9.0,2021-09-13,cushion,The cushioning setup uses a full-length Zoom Strobel feels bouncy. It also offers a decent amount of compression and impact protection.
8146,163,33,9.0,2021-09-13,cushion,"I love the cushion, but I consider them to be a step back compared to the last two models."
8147,163,32,9.0,2021-09-13,cushion,The full-length Zoom Air Strobel is an improvement on last year's model. It feels like a combination of the cushion on both the 34 and the 35. These feel springy and bouncy.
8148,163,1,10.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The cushion setup provides a wicked energy storage and release mechanism.
8149,163,6,10.0,2022-04-15,cushion,The full-length Zoom Strobel unit is amazing. Fans of Zoom will love the cushion in this shoe.
8150,163,321,9.3,2021-11-03,cushion,"The cushioning is the best feature that this shoe has to offer. You feel bouncy and it can really be felt underfoot, especially in the forefoot."
8151,163,7,10.0,2022-01-22,materials,"The weave used for the upper is a lot stronger than it looks. There are no issues with durability, and it's very light."
8152,163,7,10.0,2022-05-22,materials,The shoe has fantastic breathability. It's also solid in terms of durability. I love the materials.
8153,163,293,9.0,2021-09-13,materials,The materials are paper-thin but feel durable. It's both minimal and comfortable.
8154,163,33,9.0,2021-09-13,materials,"The materials are strong, lightweight, and well-ventilated."
8155,163,32,9.0,2021-09-13,materials,I like how lightweight they feel on foot. Breathability is also not going to be a problem.
8156,163,1,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,Jordan Brand uses a Leno weave upper that offers tons of lockdown. It also has a strong durability profile.
8157,163,6,8.0,2022-04-15,materials,"Materials on the shoe don't feel premium, but it's supportive and light. The shoe is comfortable on foot when playing."
8158,163,7,9.0,2022-01-22,support,The more minimal Eclipse plate used on the 36 offers excellent torsional rigidity. The heel counter also helps make this one of the most supportive shoes available.
8159,163,7,9.5,2022-05-22,support,The strength of the materials helps to keep you locked in. It helps to provide fantastic lateral containment.
8160,163,293,9.0,2021-09-13,support,"For lateral containment, your foot is not moving off the footbed at all. There were also no issues with stability and support."
8161,163,33,9.0,2021-09-13,support,"Lockdown is surprisingly good. Overall, the support is good from the midsole up. The only potential issue is the protruding shape of the air unit on the outsole."
8162,163,32,9.0,2021-09-13,support,Lateral support and lockdown are good. I had no issues when making any movements in this shoe.
8163,163,1,9.0,2022-01-22,support,"This shoe isn't the most flexible, but it offers plenty of stability. The protrusion of the Zoom unit in the forefoot also makes the shoe slightly unsteady."
8164,163,6,10.0,2022-04-15,support,I had absolutely zero issues with the support on this shoe. There's no heel slippage or side-to-side movement on the footbed.
8165,163,321,8.5,2021-11-03,support,"I had no heel slippage, and containment was solid. The materials do a decent job of securing your feet. One thing to consider is that every now and then I would feel a bit wobbly on certain cuts and movements."
8166,163,7,9.5,2022-01-22,fit,The shoe fits me very snug right out of the box. It took me about 30-40 minutes to break them in. I think that they are as close as possible to a one-to-one fit.
8167,163,7,8.5,2022-05-22,fit,"The length of the shoe is true to size, but with the width being narrow, I had to use thinner socks. Other than that, I had no issues."
8168,163,293,9.0,2021-09-13,fit,"It fits snug, which is what I like."
8169,163,33,9.0,2021-09-13,fit,They fit true to size but do feel a bit tight and narrow overall.
8170,163,32,9.0,2021-09-13,fit,The upper is flexible and moulds to your feet.
8171,163,1,9.0,2022-01-22,fit,The materials used on this shoe make it so that the shoe is stable and secure once you lock in your lacing.
8172,163,6,8.0,2022-04-15,fit,"I felt pretty good in this shoe. There was some snugness in the pinky toe area, but it didn't hinder my performance."
8173,163,7,0.0,2022-05-22,outdoor,I would not take these outdoors. The rubber compound is really soft.
8174,163,293,50.0,2021-09-13,outdoor,"I didn't play outdoors in these, but the rubber feels like it could perform alright outdoors."
8175,163,1,50.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,"The compound used on the shoe is tough, but it doesn't have much depth."
8176,163,321,0.0,2021-11-03,outdoor,The pattern is thin and pliable.
8177,163,7,1,2022-05-22,width,This shoe is super narrow.
8178,163,293,2,2021-09-13,width,They're narrow and tight in the toe box.
8179,163,1,2,2022-01-22,width,Go up half a size if you have a wide foot.
8180,163,6,2,2022-04-15,width,It fits a little narrow in the forefoot area. You might want to go up half a size if you have wide feet.
8181,163,321,2,2021-11-03,width,"Around the midfoot, around the eclipse plate, the shoe fits narrow."
8182,163,7,3,2022-05-22,size,I would recommend going up half a size because of the width.
8183,163,293,2,2021-09-13,size,"If you don't like a tight fit, I would suggest going up half a size. If you have a wide foot, you might want to consider going up a full size. Try them on in-store when possible."
8184,163,1,3,2022-01-22,size,Going true to size works well if you have a narrow to normal-shaped foot.
8185,163,6,3,2022-04-15,size,I would say that the Jordan 36 does run true to size.
8186,164,293,7.8,2021-10-04,expert_overall,"The Puma Fusion Nitro is a responsive feeling shoe that provides solid traction. There is a nice amount of court feel. However, the caging of the midsole cushion takes away from the impact protection."
8187,164,33,7.4,2021-09-25,expert_overall,"The Puma Fusion Nitro is a letdown compared to the Clyde All-Pros. The traction and cushion are great, but they don't work well with the rest of the shoe."
8188,164,448,8.2,2023-02-16,user_overall,"Traction is the best I've ever had on any basketball shoe or any shoe in general. However, the outrigger could be a tad wider. However, I did get a blister with these shoes if played with too long."
8189,164,449,9.3,2022-10-20,user_overall,Really good basketball shoe. Awesome tracion even on dusty courts. Look nice and clean. Cushioning is very solid but comfortable. Overall very happy with it’s performance.
8190,164,183,10.0,2024-08-06,user_overall,I may be a little bit biased since these were my first pair of basketball shoes but they did feel really good

8192,164,450,8.4,2023-02-12,user_overall,
8193,164,293,8.0,2021-10-04,traction,"Just as I expected in my initial impressions, the traction sticks well to clean courts. On dustier courts, the traction did not perform as well as I was hoping."
8194,164,33,9.0,2021-09-25,traction,The traction used on this shoe bites both hardwood and blacktop really well.
8195,164,293,7.0,2021-10-04,cushion,"There is full-length Nitro foam that is caged, so the compression is very subdued. However, there is a good amount of court feel."
8196,164,33,9.0,2021-09-25,cushion,The Puma Fusion Nitro is a well-cushioned ride. It feels nice and plush.
8197,164,293,8.0,2021-10-04,materials,"Puma uses a nice knit material to make the upper of the shoe. The materials do feel thin, but the shoe still feels comfortable. It conforms nicely to your foot."
8198,164,33,5.0,2021-09-25,materials,"The materials are awful. The upper stretches too much when there is pressure applied, especially with movements like stopping or changing directions."
8199,164,293,8.0,2021-10-04,support,"I felt a lack of arch support with this shoe. The lateral containment had no issues, but the lateral stability could be better."
8200,164,33,5.0,2021-09-25,support,"The shoe has the most typical support features but is missing an outrigger. Because of this, the rest of the shoe doesn't play well together."
8201,164,293,8.0,2021-10-04,fit,It fits my foot like a glove.
8202,164,33,9.0,2021-09-25,fit,"As long as you get the right size, the fit will work for you. I wouldn't recommend these if you don't have a perfect size."
8203,164,293,0.0,2021-10-04,outdoor,The outsole does not feel durable at all.
8204,165,382,9.1,2022-01-22,expert_overall,The Adidas Trae Young 1 might be the best shoe available in its price range. I consider this pair to be the best Adidas shoe for 2021.
8205,165,394,8.2,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Trae Young 1 offers extremely nice cushioning. The traction plays a little worse than expected, and the support isn't ideal with only two lacing holes, but it's still a solid performer with some premium touches for materials."
8206,165,1,8.2,2022-03-06,expert_overall,The Adidas Trae Young 1 is excellent for players that like to stay low to the ground and play fast in confined spaces. Just make sure to break them in beforehand.
8207,165,2,8.0,2021-09-29,expert_overall,"The Adidas Trae Young 1 is a stable sneaker. It feels low to the ground, which works well with the Lightstrike cushion in the forefoot. Just make sure to get the right size."
8208,165,293,8.0,2021-10-23,expert_overall,"Overall, the Adidas Trae Young 1 feels great on foot. When playing on clean courts, the shoe feels low to the ground, responsive, and comfortable."
8209,165,6,7.8,2021-09-30,expert_overall,"The Adidas Trae Young 1 is awesome in every way but the traction. I really like the materials, the fit and support are good, and the cushion shined."
8210,165,19,7.8,2022-02-22,expert_overall,"For the Adidas Trae Young 1, the traction works, the cushion offers impact protection and court feel, and the upper feels good for the most part."
8211,165,451,7.6,2021-10-26,user_overall,"Traction works on a clean court, but will pick up a lot of dust easily making it very slippery. Cushion is by far the best aspect about this shoe imo. Support and fit were fine for me. Nothing outstanding nothing bad. It is worth noting that this shoe has a bigger toebox compared to other shoes and that there is no tongue. Personally, I like the no tongue feature as they hug my foot more like a sock. This shoe is worth if you play on a clean court, need lots of cushioning, and can get a good fit"
8212,165,452,8.2,2024-02-15,user_overall,Orig
8213,165,320,8.3,2022-04-21,user_overall,"The Trae Young 1 is solid, but overpriced. $125 at most. Has average materials but not much ventilation, and average lateral support, despite the lack"
8214,165,453,8.7,2023-01-17,user_overall,"The heel cushion is top tier , shoe in general is responsive with a bit of bounce, traction is maybe like an A- grade (the black outsole picks up less dust than the others surprisingly), slightly wide and long but not to the point where it's affecting the support (heel stayed locked in) and playability, you can go down half a size/double sock if it bothers you so I suggest trying it out first if you can. Only issue I have faced is arch support, but I swapped out my insole and it went away"
8215,165,454,9.0,2023-11-01,user_overall,"These are my first ever pair of basketball shoes, so I don’t have a pair to reference or compare them to. Overall I love these. They are very comfortable with good traction. Haven’t used them outside yet so I can’t make a comment on that. Size wise, I stuck true to size, but they do feel a small bit loose around the foot and ankle, but you don’t even notice this when you’re playing. Also to note, they don’t have a tongue, keep this in mind when buying these."
8216,165,382,9.0,2022-01-22,traction,"I initially thought the traction would perform well, but they outperformed my expectation. The bite and grip are superb."
8217,165,394,8.0,2022-01-22,traction,The traction pattern uses both herringbone and radial patterns to offer multi-directional coverage.
8218,165,1,8.0,2022-03-06,traction,The grip of the outsole has no slippage whatsoever. The only downside is that it took quite a bit of time for the rubber to break in.
8219,165,2,8.0,2021-09-29,traction,"The traction was good on a clean court. But, in dusty conditions, I've played in better shoes."
8220,165,293,7.0,2021-10-23,traction,"I had a lot of trouble with the shoe picking up a lot of dust on dirtier courts. On cleaner courts, the traction performed nicely."
8221,165,6,6.0,2021-09-30,traction,"The traction performed decently on a clean court, but it was poor on dustier courts."
8222,165,19,8.0,2022-02-22,traction,"The traction was solid. The shoe didn't perform well on dusty courts, but they work on most other surfaces."
8223,165,382,9.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The Lightstrike midsole and the Boost in the heel felt amazing on the court. It's the perfect guard setup. The shoe is low to the ground while still providing impact protection.
8224,165,394,9.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The cushion is great for a first signature shoe. The combination of Lightstrike and Boost makes for a comfortable setup.
8225,165,1,9.0,2022-03-06,cushion,"In my opinion, the cushioning on the shoe is the ideal setup for an Adidas shoe. The Lightstrike in the forefoot allows for nimble movement, and the Boost in the heel offers shock absorption."
8226,165,2,9.0,2021-09-29,cushion,"The Trae Young 1 is made of Lightstrike in the forefoot and Boost in the heel. The impact protection feels nice in the back, and the forefoot feels low to the ground; very responsive."
8227,165,293,9.0,2021-10-23,cushion,"The cushioning setup is my favourite part of the shoe. There is a full-length Lightstrike with Boost in the heel. It feels low to the ground, and the step-in comfort has a decent amount of soft compression."
8228,165,6,9.0,2021-09-30,cushion,There is a full-length Lightstrike midsole with Boost in the heel. It is the Lightstrike that we all want to experience. The combination works well together and provides an ample amount of impact protection and responsiveness.
8229,165,19,8.0,2022-02-22,cushion,"The shoe offers a very good court feel, and the cushion setup works for it."
8230,165,382,9.0,2022-01-22,materials,"The full textile upper isn't the most premium, but it performs well. It also feels comfortable and is durable."
8231,165,394,9.0,2022-01-22,materials,"The materials provide solid performance. It felt comfortable, and my foot felt locked in."
8232,165,1,8.0,2022-03-06,materials,"The upper is wide and minimalist. It performs well, but the comfort takes some time to break in."
8233,165,2,8.0,2021-09-29,materials,"The upper is sturdy. It doesn't stretch much, and it has a good structure."
8234,165,293,8.0,2021-10-23,materials,There is a textile mesh-like material that starts stiff but becomes softer the more you play in them.
8235,165,6,8.0,2021-09-30,materials,"Mesh is what primarily makes up the upper of the shoe. It has a good structure, and the materials don't feel cheap."
8236,165,19,8.0,2022-02-22,materials,"The materials play well, but they aren't the most effective in the forefoot area."
8237,165,382,9.0,2022-01-22,support,"None of the support features blow you away, but the shoe includes all the support standards."
8238,165,394,7.0,2022-01-22,support,The support could have been much better if the shoe had more lace hole options.
8239,165,1,8.0,2022-03-06,support,"Because of the materials and lack of lacing, the shoe doesn't feel secure on the mid part of your foot. However, the foot is actually quite secure."
8240,165,2,8.0,2021-09-29,support,"The support is solid due to the structure of the upper. However, if the shoe had a better lacing system, the lockdown would be better."
8241,165,293,8.0,2021-10-23,support,There are no issues with lateral containment and support.
8242,165,6,8.0,2021-09-30,support,I had no issues with the support in this shoe. There's everything you want and nothing that you don't.
8243,165,19,8.0,2022-02-22,support,"Stability is not an issue in the Trae Young 1. The upper provides support right up to the midfoot, and I was not impressed with the forefoot."
8244,165,382,9.5,2022-01-22,fit,"The laces don't do much for the shoe, but the one-piece upper felt good on foot."
8245,165,394,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,"The fit isn't snug, so you do have wiggle room."
8246,165,1,8.0,2022-03-06,fit,"The fit is not for everybody. The forefoot is boxy, and this can sometimes make movements feel awkward. This shoe is likely best for medium and wide-footers."
8247,165,2,7.0,2021-09-29,fit,Make sure to get the right size because the shoe is fit is only adjustable from the midfoot area up.
8248,165,293,8.0,2021-10-23,fit,The fit was good for me. I had no issues. The only downside is that it isn't customizable with the lack of holes in the lacing system.
8249,165,6,8.0,2021-09-30,fit,"There is some extra space in the toe box area, but the shoe doesn't stretch much. So, the shoe fits decently."
8250,165,19,7.0,2022-02-22,fit,"The laces don't do anything for fit and support. Overall, the fit was weird on the shoe."
8251,165,382,0.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,"The rubber is soft, so I think the outdoor play will wear away at it quickly."

8253,165,1,50.0,2022-03-06,outdoor,The rubber held up well during my tests.
8254,165,2,50.0,2021-09-29,outdoor,The outsole is thick rubber. It looks like it will perform decent outdoors.
8255,165,293,50.0,2021-10-23,outdoor,"The grooves are deep, and there is a lot of rubber. They should be alright when using them outdoors."

8257,165,1,4,2022-03-06,width,The shoe accommodates wide-footers well.
8258,165,293,3,2021-10-23,width,I'd say the shoe has a regular width.
8259,165,6,2,2021-09-30,width,The shoe can be tough to get on for people with wider feet.
8260,165,394,3,2022-01-22,size,Going true to size worked well for me.
8261,165,1,4,2022-03-06,size,Narrow and medium foot shapes should go down half a size. Wide-footers go true to size.
8262,165,2,4,2021-09-29,size,"I had to go down half a size because the lacing system is short, making it hard to customize the fit."
8263,165,293,3,2021-10-23,size,"I went true to size, and there is only a bit of space in the toe area lengthwise."
8264,165,6,3,2021-09-30,size,I would go true to size.
8265,166,6,8.4,2021-08-21,expert_overall,"For the price, the Under Armour Flow FUTR X is a solid shoe. If you don't need a lot of impact protection, this shoe will be perfect for you. It has amazing traction, the fit is solid, and it's plenty supportive."
8266,166,1,8.4,2022-01-22,expert_overall,The Under Armour Flow FUTR X is great for indoor courts and provides an above-average energy return while remaining lightweight and stable.
8267,166,293,8.0,2021-08-24,expert_overall,"The traction is top tier, the cushion is responsive, and the support was good. Despite the materials, the Under Armour Flow FUTR X is a definite cop."
8268,166,455,8.8,2022-02-08,user_overall,"Recommended for lighter guards quick wing players. As usual, great traction from UA, Flow does its job again. The cushion in these was surprisingly soft, completely opposite to what i expected and saw in other basketball Flow sneakers. Lockdown and support was just incredible. The midfoot band was a stroke of pure genius.Comfort wise these were great, but not the most breathable. Padded uppers don’t let the most air through. performance, coupled with price make the futr X a great option indoors."
8269,166,456,9.6,2022-05-14,user_overall,"These are great! Should work for most players, maybe more geared towards guards."

8273,166,6,10.0,2021-08-21,traction,"Featuring the exact same pattern as the Curry 8, the traction on the Flow FUTR X is great. It's beastly whether the court is clean or dusty."
8274,166,1,10.0,2022-01-22,traction,"The better maintained the court surface, the better the traction performs. It's one of the best tractions on clean courts."
8275,166,293,10.0,2021-08-24,traction,The traction is absolutely nuts. It's just like the Curry 8. Amazing.
8276,166,6,8.0,2021-08-21,cushion,"The full-length Flow cushion is thinner than the Curry 8, so it is more firm. Impact protection isn't great, but the court feel and responsiveness are solid."
8277,166,1,8.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The Flow foam feels significant underfoot. The shoe doesn't bottom out that fast and provides solid energy return.
8278,166,293,8.0,2021-08-24,cushion,"It is a responsive cushion setup, so don't expect much bounce or impact protection."
8279,166,6,8.0,2021-08-21,materials,"Materials feel a tad cheap, but they are good in terms of performance."
8280,166,1,7.0,2022-01-22,materials,Under Armour did everything they could to make the shoe as light as possible. That means that it isn't very durable.
8281,166,293,7.0,2021-08-24,materials,The materials feel nice and comfortable. It's thin and minimal.
8282,166,6,8.0,2021-08-21,support,I had zero issues with the support in the shoe. The strap does actually add support to the midfoot area of the shoe.
8283,166,1,8.0,2022-01-22,support,The midfoot strap actually provides solid support because it hooks into the shoelaces.
8284,166,293,8.0,2021-08-24,support,I really liked how Under Armour implemented the midfoot strap. It worked well to tighten and improve lateral containment.
8285,166,6,8.0,2021-08-21,fit,The materials and addition of a strap make the fit of the FUTR X good.
8286,166,1,9.0,2022-01-22,fit,The Under Armour Flow FUTR X is one of the most comfortable fitting shoes I've put on this year.
8287,166,293,7.0,2021-08-24,fit,The fit for me wasn't the best. It gets quite roomy because of the stretch in the material.
8288,166,1,50.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,"It's fairly durable, considering there's no rubber on the outsole."
8289,166,293,50.0,2021-08-24,outdoor,The durability held up much better than I expected it to be on the Curry 8 and this uses the exact same outsole.
8290,166,1,4,2022-01-22,width,The shoe is wider in the forefoot when you go true to size.
8291,166,293,3,2021-08-24,width,It's good for wide-footers as the materials could stretch to accommodate.
8292,166,293,3,2021-08-24,size,I went true to size and felt ok length-wise.
8293,167,365,9.0,2021-09-02,expert_overall,"The Adidas Exhibit A is a refreshing entry into the Adidas basketball lineup. It's lightweight with great traction and materials. The cushion is comfortable and playable but could be better. Overall, the shoe is a reliable performer."
8294,167,6,8.4,2021-09-02,expert_overall,"The Adidas Exhibit A is a solid performer for the price. It has a great cushion if you want to feel quick and shifty. The traction is reliable, and the support has everything need in a hoop shoe."
8295,167,293,8.2,2021-09-13,expert_overall,"The Adidas Exhibit A is good but is just below the top-tier. The traction gets the job done, the cushion is responsive, and the materials perform well for the quality."
8296,167,19,7.6,2022-02-28,expert_overall,"The Adidas Exhibit A is a shoe that offers an excellent cushioning setup, but the mediocre traction is a letdown."
8297,167,266,8.8,2021-10-24,user_overall,If you are a wide footer you can still go down half a size. The shoe bed is very wide. It’s like this shoe was made for our type of feet.

8301,167,365,9.0,2021-09-02,traction,"When the courts are clean, the traction is reliable. There's minimal dust pickup, so an occasional wipe is needed."
8302,167,6,9.0,2021-09-02,traction,A diamond traction pattern has a solid bite on both clean and dusty courts. It's a good kind of consistent.
8303,167,293,8.0,2021-09-13,traction,"On clean courts, the diamond pattern performs well. On dusty courts, the traction picks up quite a bit of dust. The performance also improves after a break-in period."
8304,167,19,7.0,2022-02-28,traction,"The traction of this shoe is mediocre. It works on clean courts, but anything other than that, it becomes iffy."
8305,167,365,9.0,2021-09-02,cushion,The cushion provides lightweight stability in the forefoot and a slight amount of impact protection in the heel.
8306,167,6,8.0,2021-09-02,cushion,"The Adidas Exhibit A has a full-length Lightstrike midsole that feels firm and responsive. There is some impact protection, but it isn't very prominent."
8307,167,293,9.0,2021-09-13,cushion,The full-length Lightstrike feels similar to the Harden Vol. 4 but with much better step-in comfort. It's low to the ground and has a decent amount of compression.
8308,167,19,9.0,2022-02-28,cushion,"The cushion is a full-length Lightstrike. The court feel of this shoe is magnificent. It doesn't have the best impact protection, but I still loved it."
8309,167,365,9.0,2021-09-02,materials,I'm happy with the materials. Especially the choice to use a more comfortable half-bootie upper. They play well on the court.
8310,167,6,8.0,2021-09-02,materials,"For the price, I have no complaints. Adidas did a good job of implementing the materials across the upper."
8311,167,293,7.0,2021-09-13,materials,"It's mainly a thin mesh upper. The quality isn't the best, but it works for the price."
8312,167,19,7.0,2022-02-28,materials,"The materials feel comfortable enough, but it doesn't offer much support-wise."
8313,167,365,9.0,2021-09-02,support,"As always, Adidas has a solid base of the shoe to help with stability. This time around, I also really liked the heel support. It is minimal yet effective."
8314,167,6,9.0,2021-09-02,support,"The heel support is nicely sculpted. Your heel is locked down, and the wide base covers you laterally."
8315,167,293,9.0,2021-09-13,support,There are well-placed fuse overlays on the shoe that help to contain your foot.
8316,167,19,8.0,2022-02-28,support,"The heel counter feels rigid, but the laces don't really provide much in terms of support."
8317,167,365,9.0,2021-09-02,fit,"Fit can be inconsistent. Once you get the right size for you, the shoe plays nicely."
8318,167,6,8.0,2021-09-02,fit,"I experienced some tightness in the midfoot area, but it went away as I broke the shoes in."
8319,167,293,8.0,2021-09-13,fit,"There is some space in the toe box, but other than that, I like the fit."
8320,167,19,7.0,2022-02-28,fit,Adidas shoes have fit me weirdly for a while now. I needed to wear cushioned socks and get a smaller size to get a good fit.
8321,167,293,0.0,2021-09-13,outdoor,"I didn't play outdoors with these, but the rubber doesn't feel the most durable."
8322,167,6,4,2021-09-02,width,"Even with slightly wide feet, I was ok going down half a size. If you have wider feet, you may still want to go true to size."
8323,167,293,3,2021-09-13,width,It's a regular fitting shoe in terms of width.
8324,167,6,4,2021-09-02,size,I would recommend going down a half size.
8325,167,293,3,2021-09-13,size,I went true to my Adidas size and had no issues.
8326,168,6,8.2,2021-09-13,expert_overall,"For $100, this is a fantastic option. It is one of the best D Rose shoes to come out in recent years. It plays quickly and offers plenty of court feel though the impact protection could be better. But for the price, it's hard to beat the Adidas D Rose Son of Chi."
8327,168,293,8.0,2021-09-23,expert_overall,"Overall, the Adidas D Rose Son of Chi has good traction and feels responsive. The support is good as well. It just isn't the most minimal feeling shoe in terms of materials."
8328,168,394,7.8,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The D Rose Son of Chi has nice traction, but the cushion isn't anything special. The support plays well enough, but you can tell the materials aren't the best."
8329,168,463,8.5,2023-04-11,user_overall,"Very nice shoe for athletic players, with nice support and fit, also bounce cushion is great, but the materials is not so good, but in outdoor doing normally"
8330,168,464,10.0,2022-12-09,user_overall,I liked how durable and comfortable they are amazing ❤️

8334,168,6,9.0,2021-09-13,traction,The traction used on this shoe performs nicely. You're going to experience an amazing bite.
8335,168,293,9.0,2021-09-23,traction,"The traction performs excellently. I would say the bite is top-tier, especially on clean courts. The only drawback is the dust pickup, but this didn't affect performance after wiping."
8336,168,394,9.0,2022-01-22,traction,The best feature of the shoe is traction. Its herringbone grips the floor so well.
8337,168,6,9.0,2021-09-13,cushion,The Son of Chi uses full-length exposed Bounce cushioning. It provides good bounciness and impact protection while still remaining low to the ground.
8338,168,293,8.0,2021-09-23,cushion,"The full-length Bounce felt a little thin. The compression isn't very noticeable, so impact protection is adequate. However, it is responsive and low to the ground."
8339,168,394,7.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"The shoe uses Bounce cushioning to provide solid responsiveness. It doesn't have the best impact protection, though."
8340,168,6,7.0,2021-09-13,materials,"It doesn't use the most premium-feeling materials, but it gets the job done just fine."
8341,168,293,8.0,2021-09-23,materials,The quality of the materials is not good. It took a while to break them into the point where they felt comfortable.
8342,168,394,7.0,2022-01-22,materials,"The materials have a cheaper feel to them. It still performs, but it could've been better."
8343,168,6,8.0,2021-09-13,support,"The lateral stability of the shoe is sturdy. Overall, the support performs well."
8344,168,293,8.0,2021-09-23,support,"The upper is supportive, so my foot felt contained. I had no issues with lateral stability. The Son of Chi also felt restrictive and sturdy in the ankle mobility department. Keep that in mind if that's something you look for in a shoe."
8345,168,394,8.0,2022-01-22,support,The support of the shoe is good but not great.
8346,168,6,8.0,2021-09-13,fit,"The toe box is a bit snug, but the shoe fits decently."
8347,168,293,7.0,2021-09-23,fit,"I felt pinching in the midfoot area, but that went away after breaking them in. The materials also don't stretch much, making them feel snug."
8348,168,394,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,The fit on the shoe feels snug. There isn't much extra space provided.
8349,168,293,50.0,2021-09-23,outdoor,I feel like durability on an outdoor court would be good.
8350,168,293,2,2021-09-23,width,Slightly snug.
8351,168,394,2,2022-01-22,width,
8352,168,394,2,2022-01-22,size,I would say go true to size still.
8353,169,382,8.3,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"Donovan Mitchell's latest shoe is a step up from last year's model, but the Adidas DON Issue #3 doesn't live up to the original. It has solid traction and adequate cushioning that will suit guard play."
8354,169,2,8.0,2021-07-20,expert_overall,"Overall, the D.O.N Issue #3 is a steady basketball shoe. It has dependable traction with a wide base. The cushion and support were also dependable for me."
8355,169,32,8.0,2021-07-20,expert_overall,"The Adidas D.O.N Issue #3 has great traction and comfortable materials. It felt comfortable on foot, but the cushion doesn't hold up after playing more than three games at a time. The heel slippage also takes away from the shoe a bit. Overall, it is a responsive shoe that feels light on your feet."
8356,169,6,8.0,2021-07-25,expert_overall,"As long as you consistently wipe, you're getting a good-performing shoe. The shoe feels light, the traction performs well enough, and the materials feel nice. The only issue to consider is that there is the potential for heel slippage."
8357,169,293,7.6,2021-08-05,expert_overall,"The D.O.N Issue #3 is a lightweight shoe that provided a decent amount of court feel with the Lightstrike midsole. However, the traction, fit, and heel lockdown left a lot to be desired."
8358,169,409,7.8,2023-09-03,user_overall,"An outdoor review: This has good traction for outdoors, but it is decently durable? ive hooped about 30 hours in this, it shoes signs of the traction fading but it still performs well. You should cop these only if theyre discounted. Fun shoes to hoop in but man the cushioning is pretty mid. Not mid i mean, kinda eh. My feet start aching a bit after playing in this, maybe because I jump a lot or take very hard steps. Lock down is decent enough. Oh n dont hoop for long in these, ur feet will melt."
8359,169,467,7.8,2022-12-16,user_overall,"While I did have fun in this shoe I felt like the shoe could improve. Overall the Traction was good and it supported your foot well. But after long time playing in these my feet always got sore and were full of blisters.  The durability i also felt like could do better because after not even a year playing in them they started to break, The cushioning was also not anything write home about."
8360,169,468,8.3,2023-12-19,user_overall,I had these a while back and I would like to make my re
8361,169,469,8.4,2024-07-22,user_overall,I think everyone doesn’t talk about it but i think its so good. It can play outdoors with good traction. But it can’t protect to much. The Upper did received some signs of wear. The Materials is one of the best. The cushion is maybe fair but it took me 3 hours to break in. Support was fine. Overall its one of the best Traction and comfortable material of adidas
8362,169,470,8.6,2021-11-24,user_overall,"The D.O.N. Issue 3 was actually pretty good in my opinion. The Traction stopped on a dime but you have to wipe every now and then. The cushion is plush but very responsive.  The materials are comfortable and they feel snug on foot. The support and fit are solid, I wasn't sliding out for the most part. But overall, I recommend the D.O.N. Issue 3 to all types of hoopers in the world."
8363,169,382,8.5,2022-01-22,traction,"Overall, the traction works well. It sticks hard but can be affected by dust."
8364,169,2,9.0,2021-07-20,traction,The traction is a huge upgrade for Mitchell's signature line. The grooves are wider and thicker which helps it grip better.
8365,169,32,9.0,2021-07-20,traction,The traction on these is pretty good on both indoor and outdoor courts.
8366,169,6,8.0,2021-07-25,traction,"The spiderweb-like traction pattern is pretty good for the most part. I slipped a bit, but it was minimal."
8367,169,293,7.0,2021-08-05,traction,"The traction was not that good. It was inconsistent, and for the most part, it did not bite as hard as other shoes on the market. It performed well indoors, but on dusty courts, I was sliding a lot."
8368,169,382,8.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"The full-length Lightstrike midsole offers plushness and comfort, but it lacks the bounciness of other cushions. It also feels responsive."
8369,169,2,7.0,2021-07-20,cushion,The cushion in the D.O.N Issue #3s sits somewhere between the Harden Vol. 4 and the Dame 7. It has a little bit of bounciness but is very responsive.
8370,169,32,7.0,2021-07-20,cushion,"The feel of the cushion is similar to the Harden 4 and the Dame 7, but it is thicker. It's responsive and light but isn't the plushest cushion."
8371,169,6,8.0,2021-07-25,cushion,"The Lightstrike feels exactly like what you would expect. It's similar to Bounce but not as dense. The shoe feels responsive, and it has good heel cushioning."
8372,169,293,8.0,2021-08-05,cushion,The full-length Lightstrike is nice because it is lightweight. It provides a good amount of court feel but is lacking in impact protection.
8373,169,382,8.5,2022-01-22,materials,"The materials don't feel premium, but they are soft to the touch. I didn't have any problems playing in the shoe."
8374,169,2,8.0,2021-07-20,materials,The materials don't require any break-in time and appear to be decently durable.
8375,169,32,8.0,2021-07-20,materials,"The tongue feels really nice, and the overall materials remind me of the Dame 2. They require no break-in time but aren't the most breathable."
8376,169,6,8.0,2021-07-25,materials,"The upper is completely textile, but some rubber and fuse hits are placed strategically for durability. They definitely get the job done."
8377,169,293,8.0,2021-08-05,materials,"After an initial break-in period, the materials are a definite upgrade from the D.O.N Issue #2. It performs well and feels soft once broken in."
8378,169,382,9.0,2022-01-22,support,I think that support is one of the best aspects of the shoe. The shoe feels stable and secure.
8379,169,2,8.0,2021-07-20,support,I experienced no heel slippage. The footbed keeps you very well contained.
8380,169,32,7.0,2021-07-20,support,The lateral TPU provides good support and keeps you contained laterally. The downside is that I experienced quite a bit of heel slippage.
8381,169,6,8.0,2021-07-25,support,"I had some heel slippage in only my right shoe. Nothing too extreme, but just noticeable enough to make me feel a bit insecure. Everything else about the support felt good."
8382,169,293,8.0,2021-08-05,support,"For lateral containment, I had no issues. The setup with the foam coming up the sides of the shoe performed well. I did have a little heel slippage, but that is mostly subjective to my foot."
8383,169,382,7.5,2022-01-22,fit,"The fit is solid in the midfoot, but there is space in the forefoot. I also experienced a lot of heel slippage because of the sock liner."
8384,169,2,8.0,2021-07-20,fit,"The fit is not as snug as other recent Adidas models in the midfoot, which is a welcome improvement for me."
8385,169,32,8.0,2021-07-20,fit,I was able to go true to size.
8386,169,6,8.0,2021-07-25,fit,"The materials lay nicely over your feet, and the tongue feels nice as well."
8387,169,293,7.0,2021-08-05,fit,"The fit is not for me. It fit well length-wise, but the toe box had a lot of extra room. You may like it if you like a roomier fit."
8388,169,382,50.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,"The rubber is hard, and I didn't experience much fraying."
8389,169,2,50.0,2021-07-20,outdoor,There's isn't much fraying on my pair yet.
8390,169,293,50.0,2021-08-05,outdoor,"The rubber is fairly hard, but the grooves aren't the best."
8391,169,2,4,2021-07-20,width,The shoe does a decent job of accommodating wider feet.
8392,169,6,3,2021-07-25,width,"I have slightly wide feet, and the shoe felt good going down half a size. Keep in mind, it may feel tight when first trying them on."
8393,169,293,4,2021-08-05,width,It is a little bit wide.
8394,169,2,4,2021-07-20,size,Go half a size down for regular footers and true to size for wide footers.
8395,169,6,4,2021-07-25,size,I recommend going down half a size.
8396,169,293,3,2021-08-05,size,"It fit true to size, but there is too much space in the forefoot for my liking."
8397,170,32,9.0,2021-08-10,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom Freak 3 provides a good amount of tech at an affordable price point. They're an upgrade both performance-wise and aesthetics-wise compared to previous models. The cushion feels great, the materials get the job done, and the traction performs well after breaking it in. These are definitely a shoe going into my rotation."
8398,170,382,8.4,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"In my opinion, the Nike Zoom Freak 3 makes major improvements compared to the Zoom Freak 2. The traction is close to being a top-tier performer, and the cushion is nice and bouncy. I'd definitely recommend it."
8399,170,2,8.2,2021-07-20,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom Freak 3 is one of my favourite shoes to hoop in right now. The cushion is bouncy, the traction is one of my favourites on the market right now, and in my opinion, they look pretty darn good."
8400,170,394,8.2,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Zoom Freak 3 is good, not great. The traction is inconsistent. There is good breathability for your foot and good support."
8401,170,6,7.8,2021-08-10,expert_overall,"The Zoom Freak 3 is a solid shoe at its current price point. The traction was inconsistent, but the materials, fit, and support make up for it. Overall, Nike did a good job of upgrading the shoe from the Zoom Freak 2."
8402,170,293,7.6,2021-08-05,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom Freak 3 is a lightweight and minimal shoe. The traction was inconsistent for me, and I was disappointed in the cushion. However, I did like the materials, and the shoe has a great fit."
8403,170,321,7.5,2021-11-03,expert_overall,"Overall, the Nike Zoom Freak 3 is a decent shoe if you have a similar playstyle to the Freak himself. The traction performs well, but the support of the shoe was a letdown."
8404,170,471,5.0,2022-05-27,user_overall,"2 hours is how much it took the shoes to break. I have been using adidas products for quite a long time and I've played with my pair of issue 2 for almost two years. I bought the freaks 3 from the official nike store and right after receiving them, I decided to try them on an outside court close to where I live. I played 1v1 against my friend and I fell in a way my upper foot put lots of friction on the thin material there. I can see my foot now. Issue 2 served me for 2 years freaks for 2 hours."
8405,170,472,7.6,2024-01-07,user_overall,"Cushioning was average for me; the twin Zoom pods didn't have enough room to compress, and when you see the midsole teardown by foot doctor Zach, you can see where I am coming from. This shoe does feel unstable. I didn't really feel that springboard effect from a shoe I expected to do just that. Traction was also inconsistent. Support was great, the strap worked well and it has"
8406,170,358,9.4,2021-12-31,user_overall,"Despite the lackluster reviews thus far, this shoe is a standout performer for me as a larger wing/forward. The traction does its job after breaking in, the cushion is awesome for me with a powerful bounce that makes me feel explosive. Though heel cushioning is minimal, it doesn't matter too much as the forefoot feels so good and propels you forward. I went from a 14 to 15 with this shoe and it fits well. It is nice and wide, materials are awesome and support is top tier.  This shoe is a win."
8407,170,214,8.0,2023-04-02,user_overall,"The Zoom Freak 3 is a good shoe, but felt like a step back for the Zoom Freak line. With a decoupled outsole these are extremely flexible. There is a shank plate, but that doesn’t prevent some of the instability you can feel in this shoe. That is largely caused by the 2 side by side zoom pods in the forefoot. They are directly against the very thin outsole, and while they provide a lot of bounce and propulsion, they can also leave you feeling a little wobbly on hard cuts."
8408,170,149,8.7,2025-01-25,user_overall,"This shoe is one of the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever tried on. The traction is amazing but the durability of it is weak as it might break or tear off the more you use it. The materials is great but can do better. This is a very lightweight shoe so I would recommend guards to wear this shoe. But overall this shoe is great, not one of the best shoes out there compared to other signature shoes but is a great shoe to hoop in."
8409,170,32,9.0,2021-08-10,traction,"After a break-in period, the Zoom Freak 3 gripped the floor fairly well. They pick up a lot of dust as well."
8410,170,382,9.0,2022-01-22,traction,"The traction has a good bite and stopping power that works in all directions. It's one of the gripper tractions to come out this year, but I'd put them just below the top tier because of occasional dust pickup."
8411,170,2,9.0,2021-07-20,traction,The shoe gripped nicely on all types of court surfaces. I think this is mostly due to the traction pattern.
8412,170,394,8.0,2022-01-22,traction,"The traction can grip courts quite nicely, but it can be inconsistent. I don't have any complaints beyond that."
8413,170,6,7.0,2021-08-10,traction,The traction was inconsistent regardless of court conditions. I experienced a bit of sliding but never actually slipped out.
8414,170,293,6.0,2021-08-05,traction,I'm disappointed in the traction. The bite is inconsistent despite dust not being an issue.
8415,170,321,8.4,2021-11-03,traction,"For the most part, the traction does its job on clean courts. On a dusty court, they do start to pick up debris. The traction performs well but isn't the best that Nike has to offer."
8416,170,32,9.0,2021-08-10,cushion,"The midsole is lightweight and bouncy. The two Zoom units in the forefoot also feel responsive, bouncy, and springy."
8417,170,382,9.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"The full-length injected Phylon midsole is nice and soft, while the two giant Zoom pods in the forefoot feel bouncy."
8418,170,2,8.0,2021-07-20,cushion,"In my opinion, the cushion in the Zoom Freak 3 is an upgrade. The shoe features a pair of forefoot Zoom pods that feel bouncy after breaking them in."
8419,170,394,8.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The cushioning on these is noticeably more comfortable than last year's model. This comfort comes from two Zoom Air pods included in the forefoot.
8420,170,6,7.0,2021-08-10,cushion,"The Phylon used in the shoe is stiff and provides little impact protection. At the forefoot of the shoe, the Zoom pods are caged and aren't as springy as I would've liked."
8421,170,293,7.0,2021-08-05,cushion,"There isn't much compression with the full-length Phylon. The bottom-loaded Zoom units in the forefoot also didn't offer much in terms of bounce. However, the cushion does provide decent responsiveness."
8422,170,321,7.0,2021-11-03,cushion,The Freak 3 features a Phylon midsole with two large Zoom pods in the forefoot. The heel is plush and feels good on feet. The forefoot Zoom doesn't quite offer the responsive feeling you've come to expect from Zoom Air.
8423,170,32,8.0,2021-08-10,materials,"There is a combination of mesh and synthetics. It's not premium, but it gets the job done."
8424,170,382,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,"The Zoom Freak 3 makes use of some pretty basic materials. It feels thin, but it gets the job done."
8425,170,2,8.0,2021-07-20,materials,"The Freak 3 uses a mix of fuse and mesh that feels similar to the KD 14. They're well ventilated, and they're pretty good in terms of durability."
8426,170,394,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,The quality of the materials used could be better considering Giannis's use of the euro step.
8427,170,6,8.0,2021-08-10,materials,The materials are thin but sturdy. They're more than capable of getting the job done.
8428,170,293,8.0,2021-08-05,materials,"The quality of the materials feels nice when held in hand. On foot, they're comfortable and get the job done."
8429,170,32,8.0,2021-08-10,support,"The strap doesn't provide much for performance, but the laces perform well. The outrigger and padded heel also work well to provide support and lockdown."
8430,170,382,7.0,2022-01-22,support,"The support is adequate. It does have a wide base and lateral outrigger that perform well. However, the strap is useless, and the torsional support can be a problem for those with plantar-related issues."
8431,170,2,8.0,2021-07-20,support,"I experienced no heel slippage, and the lateral containment of the shoe really gets the job done. The wide base also helps to keep you on the footbed."
8432,170,394,8.0,2022-01-22,support,The materials and base of the shoe help provide solid support.
8433,170,6,9.0,2021-08-10,support,I didn't have any issues with the support. There is plenty of heel padding to secure your heel. The materials also do a great job of containing your foot laterally.
8434,170,293,8.0,2021-08-05,support,I had no issues with lateral containment or lateral stability as the shoe has a wide base.
8435,170,321,7.2,2021-11-03,support,The strap doesn't really offer much for lockdown. Most of that actually comes from the lacing and materials. There isn't much lateral support coming from this shoe though. It feels similar to the PG 4 where my foot rolls off the footbed sometimes.
8436,170,32,9.0,2021-08-10,fit,"They fit snug right out of the box, but they do stretch after a break-in period."
8437,170,382,9.0,2022-01-22,fit,The upper is soft and forgiving to help it conform to your foot. The lacing system and padded rear of the shoe also help to keep you locked in.
8438,170,2,8.0,2021-07-20,fit,"There is more room in the toe box of the Freak 3, making for a better fit."
8439,170,394,9.0,2022-01-22,fit,The narrow forefoot area makes the shoe fit snug. This snug fit can cause issues for players with wider feet.
8440,170,6,8.0,2021-08-10,fit,The fit starts out snug but breaks in to fit nicely.
8441,170,293,9.0,2021-08-05,fit,They fit my foot perfectly.
8442,170,382,0.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,The rubber compound used is soft and likely won't hold up well outdoors.
8443,170,2,50.0,2021-07-20,outdoor,The rubber appears to be durable.
8444,170,293,0.0,2021-08-05,outdoor,The rubber is fairly soft and probably isn't the best when playing outdoors.
8445,170,321,0.0,2021-11-03,outdoor,I don't recommend using these outdoors.
8446,170,2,3,2021-07-20,width,The shoe is more wide footer friendly than the previous Freak models as the mid and forefoot have more space.
8447,170,394,2,2022-01-22,width,These definitely fit narrow.
8448,170,6,3,2021-08-10,width,"It is a bit narrow on the lateral side of the forefoot. Wide footers go up a half size, but everyone else should go true to size."
8449,170,293,3,2021-08-05,width,"Width-wise, these are pretty normal. The forefoot area does expand over time as well."
8450,170,321,1,2021-11-03,width,Not wide foot friendly at all. They are very narrow.
8451,170,382,3,2022-01-22,size,"I did go true to size, and it fits me perfectly well."
8452,170,2,3,2021-07-20,size,"Regular footers can go true to size, but wide footers still might want to go half a size up."
8453,170,394,3,2022-01-22,size,I recommend going half size up or avoiding the shoe if you have wider feet.
8454,170,6,3,2021-08-10,size,True to size fit for me as I only have a slightly wide foot.
8455,170,293,3,2021-08-05,size,I went true to size and had no problems at all.
8456,170,321,3,2021-11-03,size,They fit true to size.
8457,171,2,8.4,2021-08-01,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Zoom G.T. Run isn't too impressive straight out of the box, but after breaking them in, they slowly become better. There is plenty of cushioning, and the traction becomes solid."
8458,171,6,8.2,2021-08-06,expert_overall,"Overall, the Nike Air Zoom G.T. Run is a really nice shoe. The only gripes I have are the less-than-premium materials and the traction when on dirtier courts. Other than that, you get tonnes of cushion, the support and lockdown are good, and the fit is solid."
8459,171,293,8.0,2021-08-15,expert_overall,"If you're looking for a crazy cushioning setup, the Nike Air Zoom G.T. Run is the shoe for you. It's a solid shoe for anyone who doesn't mind giving up some court feel and responsiveness to get more impact protection and bounciness."
8460,171,1,8.0,2022-01-22,expert_overall,The Nike Air Zoom GT Run is a solid shoe for those that are looking for an explosive setup and rely on a lot of jumping in their game.
8461,171,7,8.0,2022-02-22,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom GT Run offers solid traction while it lasts and plenty of impact protection. It could be more premium, but it performs well enough."
8462,171,394,7.8,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The G.T. Run is the worst performer of the 3 Greater Than models. The shoe has good cushioning and traction. However, the support isn't easy to trust with how thin the materials are."
8463,171,473,8.9,2023-05-21,user_overall,The shoe is good but i slips sometimes on dusty courts.

8468,171,2,8.0,2021-08-01,traction,"The rubber compound is hard at the beginning. However, the traction does become pliable and more impressive to play in as you wear them more often."
8469,171,6,8.0,2021-08-06,traction,"The traction is pretty good on cleaner courts with a strong bite, but it is somewhat slippery on dustier courts even though it doesn't pick up much dust."
8470,171,293,8.0,2021-08-15,traction,"On a clean court, there is a solid bite. But on a dirtier court, it picks up dust pretty quickly. A quick wipe made things tolerable."
8471,171,1,8.0,2022-01-22,traction,The pattern provides outstanding suction on hardwood courts.
8472,171,7,8.0,2022-02-22,traction,"I found the traction to be consistent on front-to-back movements. However, when going side-to-side, I did slide a bit."
8473,171,394,8.0,2022-01-22,traction,The traction pattern covers you in all directions.
8474,171,2,9.0,2021-08-01,cushion,The full-length React outsole is denser than the React used in Nike's running shoes making the impact protection excellent. The two layers of Zoom units in the forefoot also make the shoe very bouncy.
8475,171,6,9.0,2021-08-06,cushion,"There is a lot of cushion with a react midsole, a react insole, a forefoot Zoom unit, and a forefoot Zoom Strobel unit. You get a lot of impact protection, and it is very bouncy."
8476,171,293,9.0,2021-08-15,cushion,"The cushion setup is insane. There is a lot of compression in the forefoot due to the Zoom Strobel. The tradeoff is that there isn't as much court feel, but if you love cushion, this is amazing."
8477,171,1,9.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The double-stacked Zoom Air units provide max cushion for movements like pivoting and jumping.
8478,171,7,8.0,2022-02-22,cushion,"There's a forefoot Zoom Strobel, a Zoom bag beneath that, and a React midsole in the shoe. I found this setup comfortable, but it is high off the ground."
8479,171,394,8.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The shoe features a double-stacked forefoot Zoom setup that offers a good amount of cushion.
8480,171,2,8.0,2021-08-01,materials,"The upper is rigid and stiff, but after a break-in period, they do soften up, and the performance improves over time."
8481,171,6,8.0,2021-08-06,materials,"The dual-layered upper is the least premium aspect of the shoe. It feels cheap and does not look good after playing in them. However, from a performance perspective, they get the job done."
8482,171,293,8.0,2021-08-15,materials,"The quality of the materials is not great compared to the price of the shoe. It does conform to your foot nicely, but it doesn't feel premium."
8483,171,1,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,"There's a lack of materials on the tongue that causes some irritation. Along with being light and airy, these are actually surprisingly durable."
8484,171,7,7.5,2022-02-22,materials,"The mesh upper is minimal. I had no issues performance-wise, but they could've been more premium."
8485,171,394,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,The mesh helps keep the shoe light and breathable.
8486,171,2,9.0,2021-08-01,support,"The heel padding helps to prevent heel slippage, while the raised midsole and rigid upper keep you contained in the shoe."
8487,171,6,8.0,2021-08-06,support,I had no issues with support or lockdown. Your feet aren't going anywhere with the midsole that rises and the wide base of the shoe.
8488,171,293,7.0,2021-08-15,support,"I had some heel slippage, which was annoying, but the insole does a good job of keeping your foot on the footbed. Laterally, I had no issues due to the foam that rises along the midfoot to cage you in."
8489,171,1,7.0,2022-01-22,support,The upper is a lot more secure than they look. My only concern is that the cushion setup can cause a bit of pronation.
8490,171,7,8.5,2022-02-22,support,The midsole and the plastic lateral plate hold your foot securely. The forefoot is also wide and stable.
8491,171,394,7.0,2022-01-22,support,"The midsole spikes up in the midfoot area to offer lateral support, which I appreciated. The heel portion of the shoe also feels sturdy and secure."
8492,171,2,8.0,2021-08-01,fit,"It's a fairly narrow-fitting sneaker despite being a bit long in the forefoot area. Regardless, I had no issue with the fit."
8493,171,6,8.0,2021-08-06,fit,"The upper fits nicely on top of your foot, and I had no issues with the fit when I went true to size."
8494,171,293,8.0,2021-08-15,fit,"The fit is snug in the toe box, which is something I like."
8495,171,1,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,"Initially, it's hard to get your foot in. However, they do break in nicely because of the mesh materials."
8496,171,7,8.0,2022-02-22,fit,"I felt some pinching the first few times I played in the shoe, but it went away eventually."
8497,171,394,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,"The speckled pattern in the shoe caused some irritation for me where the shoe creased. It didn't affect the performance, but it is worth noting."
8498,171,2,50.0,2021-08-01,outdoor,They should be alright for occasional outdoor use.
8499,171,293,0.0,2021-08-15,outdoor,I don't think it's going to be durable enough for outdoor use.
8500,171,1,0.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,The treads aren't too thick. They won't last long outdoors.
8501,171,7,0.0,2022-02-22,outdoor,The tread is thin and not deep enough to hold up outdoors.

8510,171,1,3,2022-01-22,size,"They are true to size, and the shoe accommodates most feet well."
8511,171,7,3,2022-02-22,size,This shoe does run true to size.
8512,171,394,3,2022-01-22,size,I went true to size. The shoe fits a bit bigger than the Nike GT Cut.
8513,172,348,8.0,2021-07-30,expert_overall,The Nike Giannis Immortality is one of the best signature athlete budget models available. It performs just as well as some signature models despite lacking the same tech that they feature. Definitely a great bang for your buck type of shoe.
8514,172,293,8.0,2021-07-30,expert_overall,"When you're playing in the Giannis Immortality, you feel very light and really quick. The traction is amazing, and the cushion is responsive. Support could've been a bit better, but it wasn't a deal-breaker. I really like this shoe."
8515,172,6,7.6,2021-07-30,expert_overall,"The Nike Giannis Immortality is a pretty decent budget model. However, there are other shoes at the price point that do outperform the shoe. The cushion and materials feel nice, but I did have issues with support."
8516,172,394,7.6,2022-01-22,expert_overall,The Giannis Immortality is a solid performer in the subline of Giannis's Zoom Freak line with Nike. These also provide lateral containment and consistent traction while also feeling light.
8517,172,476,7.8,2023-06-26,user_overall,"The shoe is a super light and responsive, geared toward smaller players. The traction has almost no slips on clean courts, but absorbs dust like a vacuum on moderately dusty courts. The support fits really well with amazing heel support, but be careful with the thin material, as I almost ripped through one of the shoes zion style after only 2 months of using it. A tear by the big toe is common, and is where I have it on my right shoe. Other than that, it's really only worth it when its on sale."
8518,172,224,7.9,2023-02-01,user_overall,"Kinda mid tbh, I expected more about the traction but they will probably get better once a fully break them in so I will give it a 9, cushion is alright, good responsiveness tho, the worst feature in the shoe is definitely the support, the materials are really lightweight and minimal but cheap, I am concern about the durability of the upper but the durability of the traction should be pretty good, overall a solid shoe for guards who are on a budget and want a lightweight, responsive shoe."
8519,172,328,8.0,2022-10-24,user_overall,"Best feature is the support - foot feels very locked in. However the cushion is a bit lacking which is a little disappointing given the bulkiness of the heal. Court feel of the forefoot feels great, but my personal preference would be to have a less bulky heal. And if the heal is bulky, as in this case, would think it would have a little more cushion. Materials are good, especially the soft materials. Also think these are a pretty low profile shoe (again think the heal is a little much)"
8520,172,201,7.0,2023-09-24,user_overall,"this is the first budget shoe from the Giannis line. the traction held up pretty well, but it's not the best. The support has never been a problem in the Giannis line. I did experience one problem in the shoe, which was that the materials in the upper tore after just a couple months of playing in them. The cushion was lackluster because it was a budget shoe, but what could you expect? It is a solid performer, but there are so many better options available right now."
8521,172,477,8.0,2023-06-04,user_overall,The shoes are kinda comfortable. They are kinda narrow (Especially in the toebox) The ankle support isn't good and I got a pretty bad ankle sprain playing in them. They did pick up some dust. If you have a wide feet go up half a size. I went true to size and experience some lateral pain. The shoe causes me blisters. The materials are very breathable. If you have plantar fascitis I don't recommend this shoe. This review was posted after 5 months of constant use.
8522,172,348,9.0,2021-07-30,traction,No surprise that herringbone traction gets the job done. The Immortality performed very well. Wiping wasn't needed because of the deep grooves in the traction pattern.
8523,172,293,10.0,2021-07-30,traction,"The traction is top-tier. It's one of the best patterns that you can get right now. The bite is insane on clean courts, and it wasn't picking up much dust on dirtier courts."
8524,172,6,8.0,2021-07-30,traction,"The traction is just ok despite being herringbone. It performs well on clean courts, but on your average court, you'll find yourself sliding quite a bit."
8525,172,394,8.0,2022-01-22,traction,Traction is one of the standout points of the shoe. It provides a consistent playing experience.
8526,172,348,8.0,2021-07-30,cushion,"Being a budget option, the cushion used is just Phylon. Regardless, it performs decent enough, especially after a short break-in period."
8527,172,293,8.0,2021-07-30,cushion,There's nothing special in terms of the tech used for the cushion. It's low to the ground and still provides impact protection.
8528,172,6,8.0,2021-07-30,cushion,"The Giannis Immortality features a full-length Phylon cushion that's just okay. It's more on the firmer side, but you'll still get some impact protection."
8529,172,394,7.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"The Phylon midsole performs better than expected, but it's not the main feature."
8530,172,348,7.0,2021-07-30,materials,"Even though the materials are comfortable, they are also thin. Lots of mesh and synthetics were used on this model."
8531,172,293,7.0,2021-07-30,materials,"The textile mesh is thin, but I love the way it feels for the price. However, the synthetic materials used towards the back half of the shoe aren't the best."
8532,172,6,7.0,2021-07-30,materials,"The mesh material feels nice to the touch, but the performance is a bit lacklustre."
8533,172,394,7.0,2022-01-22,materials,"It's clear that these aren't the most high-quality materials. It is breathable and lightweight, though."
8534,172,348,8.0,2021-07-30,support,"The curved edge at the back of the shoe helps with rolling into your stride, but it also makes the shoe feel a bit wobbly. At the front of the shoe, the outrigger is amazing."
8535,172,293,7.0,2021-07-30,support,"The torsional support isn't the best. The lateral containment wasn't bad, and the shoe did its job stability-wise."
8536,172,6,7.0,2021-07-30,support,"There's not enough heel padding in the back of the shoe, which caused heel slippage. I also felt my foot sliding off the footbed, but the shoe does have a wide base and a decent outrigger."
8537,172,394,8.0,2022-01-22,support,There is solid lateral containment since side-to-side coverage is a focal point for Giannis's playstyle.
8538,172,348,8.0,2021-07-30,fit,They fit snug to start off but loosen up after a few hours played.
8539,172,293,8.0,2021-07-30,fit,The fit for me was perfect. It started out snug but loosened up over time.
8540,172,6,8.0,2021-07-30,fit,"It fits slightly long, and the materials lie nicely on the top of the foot."
8541,172,394,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,It has a snug fit in the beginning before breaking them in.
8542,172,293,100.0,2021-07-30,outdoor,"The rubber is fairly hard, the grooves are deep, and the price is low. It's a pretty good outdoor option."
8543,172,6,3,2021-07-30,width,"It should be fine for most, but if you have wider feet, you may want to go up half a size."
8544,172,394,3,2022-01-22,width,"I wouldn't call these narrow, but they can fit snug."
8545,172,293,3,2021-07-30,size,
8546,172,6,3,2021-07-30,size,They do run true to size for the most part.
8547,172,394,2,2022-01-22,size,I would recommend staying with your true size with these because the materials stretch out.
8548,173,365,8.6,2021-08-10,expert_overall,"Although I was disappointed in the cushion, the Nike Kyrie Low 4 still provides a smooth, lightweight experience. The traction, fit, and support combine to make this shoe a decent performer at a reasonable price."
8549,173,293,8.0,2021-07-01,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie Low 4 is a pretty low to the ground, responsive setup, but doesn't provide much bounce or compression. It plays very fast and the shoe itself is very lightweight thanks to the thin materials. It's still a shoe I really liked playing in despite being a bit disappointed in the cushion."
8550,173,6,8.0,2021-08-01,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie Low 4 is an overall good performer. One thing to note is that the shoe isn't the best for impact protection, but it does offer a lot of responsiveness, and the support is great."
8551,173,380,8.0,2022-07-19,user_overall,"Kyrie Low 4’s are a good pickup for indoor use. The traction is great and won’t disappoint. I always felt locked down and well supported in the shoe. However, the shoe’s lower price limits the cushion and durability. Once the shoe bottoms out, I had sore feet from the thin cushion. I was suprised when I found a small tear in the shoe a few months after their first use.   Lastly, I find the weight of the shoe a bit extra. They’re a great cheap shoe, but  sacrifice some comfort and durability."
8552,173,478,8.5,2022-02-23,user_overall,"This shoe had me feeling fairly bouncy and it had great stability and containment, although the cushion isnt great. There was some heel slippage but it was nothing too bad and was not a deal breaker, the traction is great on a clean indoor court but the durability was not great. I played on an outdoor court for a week and i ran through most of the outsole."
8553,173,258,8.0,2022-07-03,user_overall,The traction is good but the longer I wore them it got worse and I played indoors. Cushion is not that good. It is responsive and low to ground however impact protection is not good. My foot felt really supported in them and I did not experience heel slippage. I would say that for the price tag it is a very good performer.
8554,173,479,6.8,2021-12-12,user_overall,Its is a pretty solid shoe with OK traction. But you can see the little hump near the heel this part is really hard and I almost always leave practice/games with blisters on my heel. Other than that your getting what you payed for
8555,173,480,9.2,2021-11-23,user_overall,"I absolutely love this shoe. Super responsive cushioning. The cushlon was pretty soft and offered good impact protection, but didn't feel slow at all. Overall great performer."
8556,173,365,9.0,2021-08-10,traction,The Kyrie Low 4 has the same outsole that's used on the Kyrie 7. That means you can expect the same consistency and reliability as well.
8557,173,293,9.0,2021-07-01,traction,"The traction is amazing, top-tier traction. The pattern and rubber compound are exactly the same as on the Kyrie 7. It bites really hard on indoor courts."
8558,173,6,8.0,2021-08-01,traction,"The traction pattern on the Kyrie Low 4 is exactly the same as the Kyrie 7. They perform the same, so you may need some wiping every now and then."
8559,173,365,7.0,2021-08-10,cushion,"The Cushlon used is dense, and there's only a small amount of Zoom coverage. This means there isn't much impact protection but, there is plenty of court feel."
8560,173,293,7.5,2021-07-01,cushion,The Cushlon used in the Kyrie Low 4 feels different than the Cushlon used in the KD 14 and the Kobe 5 Protro. There isn't as much heel compression and is stiffer than both of the other mentioned pairs.
8561,173,6,7.0,2021-08-01,cushion,"There's a full-length Cushlon midsole and a Zoom unit in the forefoot, which is a bit of a letdown. It's a firm setup, and I could barely feel the Zoom unit."
8562,173,365,9.0,2021-08-10,materials,Materials on the Kyrie Low 4 are both flexible and breathable. They feel like an extension of your foot.
8563,173,293,8.0,2021-07-01,materials,"I really like the materials, but the quality isn't the best. It's a thin textile material that feels very soft and minimal."
8564,173,6,8.0,2021-08-01,materials,The textile upper is nice to the touch and gets the job done in terms of performance.
8565,173,365,9.0,2021-08-10,support,"The support in this shoe is fantastic. With a proper fit, the materials and the low cut help give you a secure ride in all directions."
8566,173,293,7.5,2021-07-01,support,"I experienced a little bit of heel slippage since there isn't much padding in the heel area. It wasn't a deal-breaker, but I just didn't quite feel locked down. Lateral containment had zero issues though."
8567,173,6,9.0,2021-08-01,support,"I had no problems with support. There was no movement of my foot on the footbed. I never felt unstable, especially with the wide base."
8568,173,365,9.0,2021-08-10,fit,"The strength of the upper leaves little room for stretch, so going true to size will help provide extra room for toe splay in the forefoot."
8569,173,293,8.0,2021-07-01,fit,It fits exactly like the Kyrie 7. I went true to size and it fits me very well.
8570,173,6,8.0,2021-08-01,fit,"The shoe fits snugly and leans toward the narrow side. It caused a bit of discomfort in the forefoot, but other than that, the shoe does fit nicely around my foot."
8571,173,293,0.0,2021-07-01,outdoor,Do not play with these outdoors at all. I ran through the rubber outsole in about 2 days.
8572,173,293,2,2021-07-01,width,It does run slightly narrow in the toe box.
8573,173,6,2,2021-08-01,width,"I'm a slightly wide footer, and this shoe fits narrow when I went true to size."
8574,173,293,3,2021-07-01,size,"I recommend going up half a size unless you're looking for a snug fit. I personally like a snug fit, but I think it might cause some discomfort for people who don't."
8575,173,6,3,2021-08-01,size,Going true to size is perfectly fine if you have normal feet.
8576,174,293,8.5,2021-07-01,expert_overall,"The Curry 3Z5 is an amazing shoe for only $80. The traction is phenomenal. The Micro G feels soft and responsive like the Micro G of old, and the fit was perfect. The only downside is that the heel area was a bit uncomfortable when I was breaking it in. Overall, the shoe felt amazing."
8577,174,6,8.2,2021-09-02,expert_overall,"At a retail price of $80, the Curry 3Z5 is a solid shoe. I have no complaints outside of the dust pickup on dirtier courts, but that's just nitpicking since it still performed nicely."
8578,174,199,8.0,2022-08-18,user_overall,Traction is the best part of this shoe. Like the other Curry models it has above average traction. Although you have to wipe pretty often The traction is probably the best feature of the shoe. It is pretty light and quick for the price. It started to wear down at probably about 20 games of basketball. The support and stability is not very good but for its price it packs a punch.
8579,174,315,9.0,2023-10-10,user_overall,"The traction is crazy good, and the micro g in the midsole is bouncy and has insane impact protection, and the shoe fits like a glove."
8580,174,481,7.8,2022-12-22,user_overall,"Traction’s terrible. The cushion and support is great. If we could get some traction, this would be a very solid shoe."
8581,174,482,9.2,2024-01-16,user_overall,They are a great budget shoe and perform perfect in my opinion these are my favorite basketbal shoes ever
8582,174,483,10.0,2022-05-03,user_overall,Best basketball shoe for its price! Get it the price is amazing
8583,174,293,9.0,2021-07-01,traction,"The traction has a solid bite on clean courts. On dustier settings, it does pick up some dust, but it's not that frequent."
8584,174,6,9.0,2021-09-02,traction,"Overall, the traction is pretty good. You'll have no issues on cleaner courts, but dust does get stuck on dirtier courts. Make sure to wipe to maintain consistency."
8585,174,293,9.0,2021-07-01,cushion,The full-length Micro G feels like old-school Micro G. You feel very low to the ground with good impact protection.
8586,174,6,8.0,2021-09-02,cushion,"There is a full-length Micro G midsole. It's thick in the heel and tapers off in the forefoot. There's a good amount of impact protection in the heel, but the forefoot provides plenty of court feel."
8587,174,293,8.0,2021-07-01,materials,"The materials are pretty thin, but I love how it feels on foot. It's very comfortable, and the materials move well with your foot."
8588,174,6,8.0,2021-09-02,materials,"It's primarily made of mesh. For the price, it does feel nice."
8589,174,293,7.5,2021-07-01,support,"The heel area around the back of my foot dug into my heel a bit. It wouldn't hurt because of the padding, but it hindered my ankle movement a little bit. The lateral containment caused me no issues."
8590,174,6,8.0,2021-09-02,support,I never had any feeling of instability when playing in this shoe.
8591,174,293,9.0,2021-07-01,fit,"The length was perfect, and the toe box fits nice and snug. If it's a bit tight at first, give it some time, and it will stretch when it breaks in."
8592,174,6,8.0,2021-09-02,fit,"I had no issues with the fit at all. There was no tightness in the midfoot, and even the minimal bubbling in the toebox was unnoticeable."
8593,174,293,0.0,2021-07-01,outdoor,There are areas of thinner rubber on the outsole. It probably isn't going to be the best for outdoor play.
8594,174,6,50.0,2021-09-02,outdoor,"The outsole rubber feels too soft to hold up well outdoors, but the price point makes it more palatable."
8595,174,6,3,2021-09-02,width,"If you have a wider foot, you may want to consider going half a size up."
8596,175,7,9.2,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Zoom GT Cut is my favourite Nike basketball shoe this year. It offers a Kobe-like setup that's lightweight with fantastic cushioning. The traction holds up, and the shoe is comfortable right out of the box."
8597,175,321,9.2,2021-11-03,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut is a perfect indoor basketball shoe. They are the definite best shoe to release in 2021 for shifty and quick players who emphasize lockdown, cushion, and traction."
8598,175,33,9.0,2021-06-21,expert_overall,"If you love the Kobe 8, you'll love these. The shoe does an excellent job of providing a low-profile, lightweight setup that still provides a decent amount of cushioning. However, I would recommend playing indoors to get the most out of the traction."
8599,175,394,9.0,2022-01-26,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Zoom GT Cut is as close to a Kobe as it gets. The cushion is one of the best on the market, and the traction performed well. These kill it on the court."
8600,175,2,8.8,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"For people that like low-profile sneakers, this is a must-have in your collection. The cushion is an amazing combination of responsiveness and bounce, and the traction performs very well. The only thing to watch out for is that the shoe does fit snug."
8601,175,293,8.6,2021-05-21,expert_overall,"This a top-tier performer. The cushion is phenomenal and the traction performs really nice as long as you wipe to keep dust from building up. It can get a little tight in the forefoot area, but not enough to take away from the performance."
8602,175,394,8.6,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"This review is for outdoor performance. The Nike Air Zoom GT Cut is easily worth the money. I don't use the word often, but these are fantastic. The traction holds up well, and the cushion is one of the best available."
8603,175,6,8.4,2021-06-02,expert_overall,"The cushion in this shoe is one of the best setups for fast and shifty players. It's a great performer but is a bit expensive coming in at $170 retail. However, I feel the performance makes the shoe worth it."
8604,175,484,9.5,2022-10-09,user_overall,"Before giving Cuts to my HS son for his season, I had to try them to determine if they lived up to the hype (and aftermarket price tag). Apparently, I just had to play regularly almost 40 years to find the ultimate basketball shoe. Each player is unique but to me, this is the 1st time you can legitimately satisfy as many of those potential needs as possible (at any position"
8605,175,214,9.8,2023-03-31,user_overall,"This is the best shoe I have ever hooped in. My only complaint is that Nike never really gave people a chance to buy them for a fair price. Both of mine came from marked up resellers. The only real knock on these is that the tongue traps a lot of heat. The traction is great, but isn’t the most long lasting design. Some people complained about the weight in the heel, but I actually liked that."
8606,175,303,9.6,2023-05-02,user_overall,"One of the best shoes ever made. Traction is top tier just have to wipe, support and lockdown are amazing. Cushioning is phenomenal with the full air zoom though the drop in does bottom out. Shoe has some weight to it but not bad at all. Overall these and Lebron 20 are probably the best I’ve played in so far."
8607,175,372,9.8,2022-07-10,user_overall,With both the react and the zoom air tech this shoe is a top tier performer and for me a cheat code.One of the best shoes in the market right now.If u find it under 200 bucks just buy it.
8608,175,485,8.7,2022-06-11,user_overall,Traction on dusty courts is not very good. Other than that it’s solid.
8609,175,7,8.5,2022-01-22,traction,I had no real issues with the traction pattern. It performed great in all court conditions.
8610,175,321,9.0,2021-11-03,traction,"It has an aggressive traction pattern which, when combined with the rubber compound, provides a loud and tacky bite when playing. It works on both clean and dusty courts (with some wiping)."
8611,175,33,9.0,2021-06-21,traction,"The traction indoors was awesome. There was a little bit of a break-in time, but they became very grippy."
8612,175,394,9.0,2022-01-26,traction,"The indoor performance is better than outdoor performance, but they feel sticky and grip well regardless."
8613,175,2,9.0,2021-05-06,traction,One of the better tractions available on the market.
8614,175,293,9.0,2021-05-21,traction,"On a dusty court, the traction picked up a bit of dust, but after a wipe, it was good to go. When playing on a clean court, the stopping power was amazing. The bite was also top tier."
8615,175,394,8.0,2022-01-22,traction,Outdoor review: The unique traction pattern grips very well in most conditions.
8616,175,6,9.0,2021-06-02,traction,"The traction on here is actually really nice. You won't have problems with clean courts. It does pick up quite a bit of dust, but as long as you're wiping, it'll still be good."
8617,175,7,10.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"The cushion feels like a Kobe shoe due to the drop-in React midsole. The Zoom Air unit in the heel provides solid impact protection, while the Zoom Strobel allows the forefoot to remain responsive."
8618,175,321,9.5,2021-11-03,cushion,The cushioning on the shoe is simply amazing. The React midsole is responsive. The full-length Zoom Strobel and double-stacked heel Zoom feel very bouncy.
8619,175,33,9.0,2021-06-21,cushion,"The cushion is my favorite part about the shoe. They have a drop-in React midsole and a full-length Zoom Strobel that, once broken in, starts to mold to your foot."
8620,175,394,10.0,2022-01-26,cushion,"The cushioning is the main highlight of the shoe. The combination of React, Zoom Strobel and heel Zoom Air is fantastic for impact protection while remaining low to the ground."
8621,175,2,10.0,2021-05-06,cushion,The cushion is the best by far for a sneaker that is this low to the ground. It feels very bouncy and still provides lots of impact protection.
8622,175,293,9.0,2021-05-21,cushion,"The cushion is my favorite part about the shoe. There's a drop-in, full-length react midsole and full-length Zoom strobel underneath. The shoe is very low to the ground with little compression, but it still feels bouncy thanks to the Zoom strobel."
8623,175,394,10.0,2022-01-22,cushion,Outdoor review: The cushioning is one of my favourite features of this shoe. They use a React insole that provides solid impact protection. There's also a full-length Zoom Strobel underneath combined with a heel Zoom Air unit.
8624,175,6,9.0,2021-06-02,cushion,"The cushion in this shoe is amazing. It gives you pretty much everything you want. Great responsiveness, impact protection, and bounciness."
8625,175,7,10.0,2022-01-22,materials,Mesh and neoprene combine to offer a comfortable fit right out of the box. They're also breathable and plenty durable.
8626,175,33,9.0,2021-06-21,materials,The materials are great. The shoe is very comfortable with lots of airflow. There was very little break-in and I was surprised with just how durable the upper turned out to be.
8627,175,394,9.0,2022-01-26,materials,The mesh upper is really nice on this design. It's light and breathable.
8628,175,2,8.0,2021-05-06,materials,The upper is made of mesh that offers extra reinforcement in high wear areas. The placement is well thought out by Nike.
8629,175,293,8.0,2021-05-21,materials,"The forefoot feels like a canvas material and the midfoot area feels somewhat like flyknit. There's a tiny bit of padding on the tongue, keeping the shoe fairly minimal."
8630,175,394,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,"Outdoor review: There aren't any premium touches like leather, but the mesh does not feel cheap at all. It feels nice and is breathable."
8631,175,6,8.0,2021-06-02,materials,"The materials on the upper feel very nice, durable, and breathable. They use quality materials that get the job done."
8632,175,7,9.0,2022-01-22,support,The plastic forefoot cage provides lateral containment. The torsional plate also offers fantastic torsional rigidity.
8633,175,321,9.0,2021-11-03,support,"The React footbed has a pattern that helps keep your foot from sliding on the footbed. The internal heel counter performs well, and I really like the lacing setup. I think the lockdown is perfect, but the support feels just average. I wish they added an outrigger."
8634,175,33,9.0,2021-06-21,support,"The lockdown was fantastic. On certain movements, I could hear a noise from the heel, but it didn't affect the performance."
8635,175,394,8.0,2022-01-26,support,"There's not much give to the upper, and the rail guard, on the lateral side of the shoe, helps keep your feet contained on lateral movements."
8636,175,2,9.0,2021-05-06,support,"It's one of the most supportive sneakers I've ever worn. You feel very contained, especially on lateral cuts. The shoe also has very nice heel cushioning."
8637,175,293,9.0,2021-05-21,support,"As far as support and lockdown go, there are zero issues. The drop-in midsole cups your foot to help the plastic material along the lateral side of the shoe contain your foot."
8638,175,394,8.0,2022-01-22,support,"Outdoor review: There aren't any outstanding aspects for stability, but it's not lacking either. The heel and ankle support keeps your foot locked in."
8639,175,6,8.0,2021-06-02,support,I didn't have any support issues in this shoe. The heel counter is very supportive and I felt no shifting on the footbed in the forefoot area.
8640,175,7,8.5,2022-01-22,fit,These fit me perfectly length-wise. The tongue and lacing system are also helpful for customizing the fit.
8641,175,33,9.0,2021-06-21,fit,They fit me just the way I like my shoes to fit.
8642,175,394,9.0,2022-01-26,fit,The fit is perfect for me width and length-wise.
8643,175,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,The shoe fits pretty snug in the forefoot area.
8644,175,293,8.0,2021-05-21,fit,"My toe goes right to the edge of the shoe in terms of length, so it fits a bit snug in the toe box area. Other than that, the shoe fit great."
8645,175,394,9.0,2022-01-22,fit,These fit me perfectly.
8646,175,6,8.0,2021-06-02,fit,"The fit was pretty nice, but one thing to note is there is a bit of pressure near your pinky toe area coming from the side of the shoe."
8647,175,7,100.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,I would recommend these indoors and outdoors because the rubber is hard.
8648,175,321,0.0,2021-11-03,outdoor,I'd say durability is less than stellar. I wouldn't recommend taking these outdoors.
8649,175,2,50.0,2021-05-06,outdoor,"I have not played with them outdoors, but the rubber compound seems like it would be ok."
8650,175,394,50.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,"For this review, I played outdoors, and the rubber has helped up nicely."
8651,175,394,3,2022-01-26,width,These should accommodate most foot shapes.
8652,175,293,2,2021-05-21,width,Slightly narrow and I could feel the plastic on the lateral side of the shoe squeezing my foot a tiny bit. It wasn't enough to bother me though.
8653,175,394,3,2022-01-22,width,"It isn't very narrow, so it should be usable for all foot types."
8654,175,6,3,2021-06-02,width,"If you have really wide feet, you may feel pressure coming from a plastic piece on the lateral side of the shoe."
8655,175,321,3,2021-11-03,size,It fits true to size.
8656,175,394,3,2022-01-26,size,I had no issues with going true to size.
8657,175,2,3,2021-05-06,size,"If you have a regular shaped foot, you should be good with going true to size. Wide footers may want to consider going up half a size."
8658,175,293,3,2021-05-21,size,"I went true to size and it fits me very well. If you don't like a snug fit, lengthwise, I would suggest going up half a size."
8659,175,394,3,2022-01-22,size,I went true to size and had no issues.
8660,175,6,3,2021-06-02,size,I am a slightly wide footer and I felt pretty good.
8661,176,486,8.5,2021-06-14,expert_overall,"The shoe very much feels like a budget model. There are certain aspects of the shoe that could have been done much better, but the mid-tier tech is what was put in the shoe instead."
8662,176,112,8.3,2022-07-01,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 1 is one of my favourite shoes. The cushioning is comfortable, and the lockdown and stability are solid."
8663,176,32,8.0,2021-05-10,expert_overall,"Every aspect of this shoe is solid. There is nothing amazing about this shoe, but there's nothing bad about it either. For $120 you get a solid first signature shoe that works for all types of players."
8664,176,293,8.0,2021-05-18,expert_overall,"If you want a comfortable shoe that provides a lot of bounce and protection, this is a great shoe to pick up. On the flip side, because the cushion is very bouncy, the shoe does feel a bit slow. Couple that with the traction not being the most consistent, this shoe may not be the best fit for everyone."
8665,176,394,8.0,2022-01-22,expert_overall,The Jordan Zion 1 is a good place to start Zion's signature shoe line. This is a well-balanced performer.
8666,176,7,7.9,2022-03-28,expert_overall,"Overall, if you like a firmer cushion setup, I think you'll enjoy the Jordan Zion 1. The shoe is super supportive, and the rubber is solid enough that it could be a decent outdoor pair."
8667,176,6,7.8,2021-05-13,expert_overall,The Zion 1 is a solid first signature shoe and was fun to play in. I just wish that they had used more premium materials.
8668,176,221,7.8,2021-07-01,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zion 1 provides a smooth ride that leads you into the extra bottom-loaded Zoom unit in the forefoot for some extra nice pop. However, its shortcomings are a bit too much to overcome. The fit is not versatile enough to accommodate more types of foot shapes and I experienced quite a bit of slipping with the traction and in the heel area of the shoe."
8669,176,487,7.6,2022-01-27,user_overall,"Shoe feels great on foot. Very light and responsive. Traction is pretty bad on a dusty court. I’m constantly wiping. On a clean court, it has a pretty good stop. This is for the translucent outsole, so the solid rubber might work better. The outsole piece protruding out the bottom provides great support, and the materials feel a little cheap but ventilated. Overall I would recommend this shoe to someone who doesn’t play ball seriously because it is solid for the price."
8670,176,320,8.4,2022-06-21,user_overall,"The Zion 1 is a decent all-around option, a good budget option (on discount) for players looking for a cushiony and supportive shoe. Traction is inconsistent especially on dust, but lateral support is great, as is the cushion, especially in the forefoot. Materials are pretty solid, are light and breathable, but the tongue padding is a little disappointing. I would suggest this shoe for bigger guys who (like Zion), need lateral stability and cushioning."
8671,176,488,8.7,2022-12-18,user_overall,"I got the Zions in January of 2022 and I am just starting to grow out of them, I have only been using them on outdoor courts and the occasional indoor courts, but these have been amazing for me, the durability has been amazing, I have just found the first tiny hole in the side of the shoe just before the midsole and it been because the of the glue, the grip is still amazing (the shoes are almost bald), cushioning has been amazing aswell."
8672,176,489,7.9,2024-01-20,user_overall,"This ones is in my rotation right now. Frankly speaking it's really god option for 60$ but not for 110$. This pair collects dust better than vacuum cleaner, but on the clean surface their traction is gourgeous... If you want to buy this ones get ready for sweaty feets because this pair have no vent. Cushion isn't as good how it seems to be. Supportiveness is one of the best i tried."
8673,176,490,8.6,2022-11-03,user_overall,"I really like playing in these shoes, the traction and extra ankle support really gives me confidence that I won't suffer an injury when I'm making hard turns, the cushioning is also great, it absorbs a lot of shock when hitting the ground after a rebound, but the shoe does pick up a lot of dust quickly, I'd recommend this shoe for centers/wings."
8674,176,112,8.0,2022-07-01,traction,I had no issues with traction on clean courts. It can occasionally slip on dusty courts.
8675,176,32,8.0,2021-05-10,traction,The herringbone traction pattern allowed me to change directions easily.
8676,176,293,6.0,2021-05-18,traction,"It's not very nice indoors. On dusty court, you're going to need to wipe a lot because of the dust pickup. Even on clean courts, I slipped out a lot."
8677,176,394,8.0,2022-01-22,traction,The traction pattern is really solid. I think it's a good setup.
8678,176,7,8.0,2022-03-28,traction,"I would say the traction is decent, at best. They weren't great but held up for the most part."
8679,176,6,8.0,2021-05-13,traction,"On a clean court, the translucent rubber will stop on a dime. On dusty courts, you will need to wipe from time to time."
8680,176,221,7.0,2021-07-01,traction,I had a pair with an entirely translucent outsole and it picked up a lot of dust. It caused me to slip quite a bit whenever I tried to plant my foot hard on a lot of movements.
8681,176,486,8.0,2021-06-14,cushion,This Air Strobel unit doesn't feel quite as nice as the Zoom unit in the KD 14 but feels nice regardless.
8682,176,112,9.0,2022-07-01,cushion,"The insole feels incredibly comfortable, and the Air Zoom Strobel is bouncy."
8683,176,32,8.0,2021-05-10,cushion,The cushioning setup is solid considering the affordable retail price. The Air Strobel gives you a cloudlike feel when you slip on the shoe but the forefoot Zoom unit felt pretty dead and didn't provide a lot of bounce.
8684,176,293,9.0,2021-05-18,cushion,"The full-length phylon, Air Strobel, and Zoom unit in the forefoot all combine to make the shoe feel very bouncy. The shoe also provides plenty of impact protection, but it doesn't feel very responsive."
8685,176,394,9.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The shoe excels in the cushioning department. It feels springy as soon as you put them on.
8686,176,7,7.5,2022-03-28,cushion,"There is an Air Strobel unit with a Zoom Air unit underneath the forefoot. I couldn't feel the Zoom Air unit at all. Overall, the setup felt firm."
8687,176,6,8.0,2021-05-13,cushion,"The full-length Phylon midsole with an Air Strobel and a Zoom unit in the forefoot feels very smooth, gives you good impact protection but isn't crazy bouncy."
8688,176,221,9.0,2021-07-01,cushion,The full-length Air Strobel board feels cloud-like which is incredible for the price that the Zion comes in at.
8689,176,112,8.0,2022-07-01,materials,"The materials feel cheap, and the durability doesn't look the best. It doesn't affect the performance, though."
8690,176,32,8.0,2021-05-10,materials,"The materials make the shoe light, strong, and durable. The tongue is a little bit too thin for my liking."
8691,176,293,8.0,2021-05-18,materials,"There is no break-in time because the shoe is made of very minimal materials. However, they aren't the best in terms of quality."
8692,176,394,7.0,2022-01-22,materials,"Most of the upper are made of fuse and textiles, and they feel like this is where Jordan Brand cut costs."
8693,176,7,7.5,2022-03-28,materials,"Screen mesh and synthetic materials make up the majority of the shoe. The materials feel cheap, but they are breathable."
8694,176,6,6.0,2021-05-13,materials,"The materials are very, very basic with cheap-feeling Mesh and Fuse overlays for added durability. In terms of performance, they get the job done, however."
8695,176,221,8.0,2021-07-01,materials,"The materials are almost identical to those that can be found on the Jordan 34. With the lower price point of the ZIon, the materials make a lot of sense."
8696,176,486,9.0,2021-06-14,support,The shoe has quite a wide base to provide extra lateral support and stability.
8697,176,112,8.0,2022-07-01,support,"The exaggerated outrigger is one of my favourite features on the shoe. The forefoot is wide, and the shoe has solid stability."
8698,176,32,9.0,2021-05-10,support,The massive outrigger gives you a lot of stability on cuts and the lockdown keeps your feet in place when changing directions.
8699,176,293,8.0,2021-05-18,support,I had no issues with support and lockdown. The bottom two lace loops provide a bit of extra support with lateral movements. My only concern is the shoe feels very low and not tight around the ankle.
8700,176,394,8.0,2022-01-22,support,The lateral side of the shoe helps contain your foot on hard side-to-side movements.
8701,176,7,9.0,2022-03-28,support,One of the strong suits of the shoe is the support. The shoe is fantastic at preventing you from rolling over.
8702,176,6,9.0,2021-05-13,support,"The internal heel counter is very stiff, rigid, and keeps your heel locked down. I had no side-to-side movement on the footbed and the wide base provides a lot of stability."
8703,176,221,8.0,2021-07-01,support,"I felt insecure in both the heel and the forefoot area. However, the shoe is saved by the midfoot feeling very locked in and the larger-than-average outrigger."
8704,176,32,8.0,2021-05-10,fit,"This is not the most comfortable shoe ever, but I never experienced any pain either."
8705,176,293,9.0,2021-05-18,fit,"If you like a bit of extra length in your shoe, you could go up half a size."
8706,176,394,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,These have close to a 1-to-1 fit but are a bit more on the snug side when it comes to space in the forefoot area.
8707,176,7,7.5,2022-03-28,fit,"The shoe fits well for the most part, but I did have some rubbing in the forefoot area. It wasn't sloppy, and I did feel locked into the shoe."
8708,176,6,8.0,2021-05-13,fit,Overall the fit is pretty good and the materials hug your feet nicely. There is some excess space in the toe box and there is some bubbling if you tie them tightly.
8709,176,221,7.0,2021-07-01,fit,The length of the Jordan Zion 1 is longer than expected. They fit quite long.
8710,176,293,100.0,2021-05-18,outdoor,The grooves are thick and the rubber is hard. The durability seems good enough for playing outdoors.
8711,176,7,50.0,2022-03-28,outdoor,"The rubber feels hard, and it might perform well outdoors."
8712,176,293,3,2021-05-18,width,"The materials break in quite a bit, so you should be fine going true to size."
8713,176,394,3,2022-01-22,width,"If you have wider feet, maybe test going half size up."
8714,176,7,2,2022-03-28,width,The shoe feels narrow.
8715,176,293,3,2021-05-18,size,I went true to size and it felt pretty damn good.
8716,176,394,3,2022-01-22,size,I went true to size and had no issues.
8717,176,7,3,2022-03-28,size,I did go true to size.
8718,176,6,3,2021-05-13,size,I went true to size as a slightly wide-footer and felt perfectly fine.
8719,177,6,8.0,2021-05-10,expert_overall,"For $90 retail this is a solid pickup. The firm cushioning feels like a downgrade to me, everything else is an upgrade from previous KD Trey 5 models."
8720,177,293,7.8,2021-05-10,expert_overall,"The KD Trey 5 IX is a solid performer. This shoe might be for you if you are looking for a lightweight, minimal, and affordable shoe."
8721,177,94,8.4,2023-08-19,user_overall,"This is shoe is solid if your looking for a budget sneaker. The traction is solid, but would not recommend for outdoors. The cushion is solid but not the best. The support is decent but I did roll my ankle a few times in it. The materials are soft and breathable. The shoe does also fit true to size."
8722,177,412,8.2,2021-12-13,user_overall,"The shoe is very comfortable and is great for its price. It has Nike Zoom Air in the soles, which is incredibly comfortable when applying pressure. Material feels somewhat thin but is surprisingly very durable. 8.2/10."
8723,177,491,7.8,2022-09-01,user_overall,its ok for a first shoe/budget option. Doesnt really lack in anything but doesnt excel in anything either. Really mediocre but when taking into consideration price they are ok.
8724,177,492,6.4,2023-11-12,user_overall,"I had these shoes for 4 months, and they are destroyed, I play 3 times a week, everytime that I play my feets hurts, if you want to buy them think twice."
8725,177,493,8.8,2021-11-09,user_overall,I love the blue KD Trey 5 IX! They go with my basketball uniform and are super comfortable. These shoes have good grip on the court too!
8726,177,6,8.0,2021-05-10,traction,The traction is really good on clean courts but you'll need to wipe on dusty courts because dust gets stuck in the traction pattern.
8727,177,293,7.0,2021-05-10,traction,"On clean courts, you get a nice, solid bite. On dustier courts, the traction wasn't as nice. Even wiping a lot I didn't get the performance I wanted."
8728,177,6,7.0,2021-05-10,cushion,The full-length Review cushioning feels firmer than previous KD Trey 5 models. The forefoot Zoom unit is barely noticeable.
8729,177,293,9.0,2021-05-10,cushion,The full-length Review cushioning is pretty soft and offers better impact protection than Phylon. The forefoot Zoom unit offers a nice subtle bounce. The cushioning is my favorite part of this shoe.
8730,177,6,8.0,2021-05-10,materials,The upper materials are actually pretty nice considering the budget price.
8731,177,293,8.0,2021-05-10,materials,"The textile materials feel soft, supportive, and conform well to your feet. Considering the budget price, the materials are pretty damn nice!"
8732,177,6,9.0,2021-05-10,support,"The heel counter locked down my feet securely, I didn't experience any side-to-side movement on the footbed, and the wide base offers solid lateral stability."
8733,177,293,8.0,2021-05-10,support,"Lateral support and containment were good for me, but if you are a big guy these might not be supportive enough."
8734,177,6,8.0,2021-05-10,fit,The upper hugged my feet really nicely and I didn't have any dead space in the toe box.
8735,177,293,7.0,2021-05-10,fit,The padding in the heel is pretty minimal which led to a little bit of heel slippage for me.
8736,177,293,50.0,2021-05-10,outdoor,The traction was solid on outdoor courts and the rubber held up pretty well.
8737,177,293,3,2021-05-10,width,"The width is normal, which is weird for KDs that are usually rather narrow."
8738,177,293,4,2021-05-10,size,Runs a little bit long.
8739,178,293,8.6,2021-04-08,expert_overall,"The Adidas N3XT L3V3L is a good performer and I enjoyed playing in them. They are pretty expensive at $180 though, and they didn't perform well enough to crack my rotation. They also aren't the best for guards because they're pretty bottom-heavy."
8740,178,1,8.5,2022-01-22,expert_overall,The Adidas N3XT L3V3L Futurenatural is a tremendous step forward for laceless performance shoes. The only obvious downside that I experienced was the weight of the shoe.
8741,178,6,8.4,2021-04-08,expert_overall,"If you've ever tried the N3XT L3V3L line you know what to expect performance-wise with these. For $180, I probably wouldn't recommend them because of the price and the stiff cushion setup."
8742,178,394,8.0,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Adidas N3XT L3V3L Futurenatural almost feels like the laceless version of the Harden Vol. 5, but with slightly better materials and a laceless upper."
8743,178,227,8.8,2023-10-30,user_overall,"The traction could be better ir fails on Dusty courts, cushion could be better also, support amazing, ir fire perfectly when you put it. The big down is the weight, its very heavy so its not made for guards. Overall good shoe."

8747,178,293,8.0,2021-04-08,traction,"The traction is pretty solid, but I did slip out a few times. However, I think this is mostly just because of the way I play with not planting the center of my foot on hard moves."
8748,178,1,8.0,2022-01-22,traction,The traction suctions down really well on surfaces like hardwood. It also performs well on most outdoor courts as long as the surface isn't slick.
8749,178,6,8.0,2021-04-08,traction,"This outsole pattern is very similar to the Harden Vol. 5 and offers pretty good traction. On clean courts I had no problems, but with any dust I had to consistently wipe to avoid slipping out."
8750,178,293,8.0,2021-04-08,cushion,"I liked the cushion set up a little better compared to the Harden 5 even though it uses the same tech. The Boost foam felt bouncy with nice underfoot cushioning and a decent court feel. Overall, I enjoyed this cushion setup."
8751,178,1,9.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"The shoe features a drop-in midsole comprised of Boot, Lightstrike, and a soft flange that comes up the side of the shoe. This shoe is a beast at storing potential energy and rapidly releasing it."
8752,178,6,7.0,2021-04-08,cushion,"The full-length Boost drop-in midsole with Lightstrike was a better implementation than the Vol. 5 as well. I could feel the Boost a little bit, but they definitely don't have good impact protection. The setup is very responsive with excellent court feel."
8753,178,394,8.0,2022-01-22,cushion,Boost and Lightstrike combine to provide a mixture of comfort and stability. It feels responsive and has a bit of impact protection.
8754,178,293,9.0,2021-04-08,materials,"The materials are very nice! The screen mesh upper is quite thin and very supportive. The knit around the ankle is stretchy and feels great. Overall, the materials feel very premium."
8755,178,1,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,The upper is a dual-layer setup that uses thick padding. The heel pods also hold your foot into the shoe really well.
8756,178,6,9.0,2021-04-08,materials,The Primeknit upper is really nice and the materials overall are very premium. Nothing to complain about here!
8757,178,394,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,This shoe is made of almost all the exact same materials as the Adidas Harden Vol. 5.
8758,178,293,9.0,2021-04-08,support,"I had no issues - heel lockdown, lateral support, and containment are all very nice."
8759,178,6,9.0,2021-04-08,support,I didn't have any issues with support in these. The Achilles pillows are really nice and I experienced no side-to-side movement on the footbed. Lateral stability was also nice because of the really wide base.
8760,178,394,8.0,2022-01-22,support,The added stripes that cover the forefoot do a solid job of helping to keep your foot contained.
8761,178,293,9.0,2021-04-08,fit,"The fit is very snug, especially in the toe box. The only issue I had was these were very hard to take on and off."
8762,178,1,9.0,2022-01-22,fit,The padding mentioned earlier sucks down on your foot to keep you secure. The shoe really fits the foot well.
8763,178,6,9.0,2021-04-08,fit,"The fit is great, but they are really hard to put on and take off. Make sure you get the right size because the lack of laces means you can't adjust the fit at all."
8764,178,394,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,The Futurenatural process of making the shoe feel as close to the foot as possible gives you more freedom to move around in the shoe.
8765,178,293,50.0,2021-04-08,outdoor,Durability is alright.
8766,178,1,50.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,The durability is in the middle of the pack for outdoor shoes but pretty good for basketball shoes.
8767,178,6,2,2021-04-08,width,If you have really wide feet you may want to stay away from these.
8768,178,394,2,2022-01-22,width,This shoe fits snugger than the Harden Vol. 5.
8769,178,1,3,2022-01-22,size,These shoes accommodate just about every shape of feet. I would recommend going true to size.
8770,178,6,4,2021-04-08,size,I recommend going down half a size.
8771,178,394,4,2022-01-22,size,I would recommend going half a size down.
8772,179,33,9.2,2021-06-21,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 14 is one of the best shoes of 2021 so far. The cushion feels like a springy marshmallow, the traction was fantastic, the support and lockdown were great. The shoe does everything well from a performance basketball perspective."
8773,179,32,9.0,2021-05-04,expert_overall,"Every aspect of the KD14 performs really well and I like it better than the KD13. The cushion feels awesome and the traction and fit work well after a short break-in period. Also, the $150 price is fair considering all the tech you are getting."
8774,179,293,9.0,2021-05-10,expert_overall,"The KD 14 might be my #1 favorite shoe to play in right now! Awesome traction, minimal materials, and responsiveness without compromising impact protection - I absolutely love playing in them!"
8775,179,1,9.0,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 14 provides excellent grip, stability, and cushion - especially when moving from side to side. It also does this without compromising much at all performance-wise."
8776,179,7,8.9,2022-02-01,expert_overall,I definitely recommend the Nike KD 14. They have one of the best tractions out right now and a fantastic cushion. The support is also solid with the cheap-feeling materials being the only con.
8777,179,394,8.8,2022-01-22,expert_overall,"Overall, the Nike KD 14 is another step forward in Kevin Durant's shoe line. They're light on foot, breathable, and the traction is great."
8778,179,6,8.6,2021-05-04,expert_overall,"The KD 14 is very comfortable, a lot of fun to play in, and just a great shoe overall."
8779,179,486,8.4,2021-06-14,expert_overall,"The KD 14 is one of the most versatile shoes out right now. It has the best technology that Nike has to offer, making it so that everyone can play in the shoe regardless of position. I feel like the KD 14 has something to offer for everyone and it's one of my favorite shoes to play in right now."
8780,179,497,9.3,2022-03-28,user_overall,The Nike KD14 is an amazing performer for basically everybody. The traction is great and it doesn’t pick up too much dust. The cushion is amazing and it is very soft with great impact protection and bounce. The support was pretty good and the shoe locked you in pretty well. The materials were pretty good but it got a little hot after playing in it for a while. The durability on the materials weren’t that great but the rubber holds up very well. Overall it’s a great shoe and I would recommend it.
8781,179,498,9.4,2022-06-24,user_overall,"This shoe is amazing,I think it’s actually the best shoe that I own right now.It is very small,I had to go one size up.Personally I think the traction,on a clean court,is as good as the curry 8 and curry 9.The zoom unit makes it be very bouncy and you don’t need to brake in for it to work.You rarely need to wipe the bottom of the shoe because it rarely picks up dust.I have been playing with the KD14 on dusty courts for 5-6 months and I wiped only 2 times.The shoe can’t hold up on otutdoor courts"
8782,179,499,9.0,2022-04-06,user_overall,"The traction was great and bites good. It does require a wipe after 6 or 4 plays though. The cushion was amazing. The Cushlon and full length Zoom strobel provided amazing compression. Support was pretty good, my foot didn't roll over on itself at all. The materials were good, very minimal and felt good on foot. The fit for me was nice, but go down half a size. You can play outdoors in these if you want. Overall, good ball shoe for any position. This is my go-to."
8783,179,214,9.0,2023-03-31,user_overall,"One of the best shoes on the market. Lockdown on this shoe is fantastic. Cushioning is super plush and impact protection is top tier. Cons are lack of breathability, the curved upward design of the shank plate causes arch pain, but this can be fixed with a good orthotic. The softness of the cushioning can sometimes make you feel unstable on hard lateral cuts, stops, and landings. The outsole design makes this a viable outdoor shoe."
8784,179,483,9.4,2022-04-24,user_overall,"The traction is just below the Curry 9, the cushion is the best thing about this shoe, super bouncy! The materials are really thin but not the most premium for the price and the heel is not clunky so heel to toe transition is very nice. This is a good shoe for non guard positions. But The kd 15 will be out in like a month or 2 so I would recommend that for gaurds but the kd 14 is a very nice performer all round"
8785,179,33,9.5,2021-06-21,traction,The traction on these guys is just amazing. I had no issues indoors or outdoors. I have zero complaints.
8786,179,32,8.0,2021-05-04,traction,"The traction took a little bit to break in, but then they gripped the floor pretty well."
8787,179,293,10.0,2021-05-10,traction,"The traction is top tier! Even on a dusty court, the KD14 was gripping like crazy."
8788,179,1,10.0,2022-01-22,traction,"The outsole has wider right angles and linear panels, allowing it to grip more intimately into the court."
8789,179,7,10.0,2022-02-01,traction,"As far as the traction goes, it was fantastic. I had no need to wipe dust and had zero slide-outs."
8790,179,394,10.0,2022-01-22,traction,"The traction on these performs just as well as the KD 13s, if not better."
8791,179,6,10.0,2021-05-04,traction,"The traction on the KD14 is freaking amazing. You'll stop on a dime on clean courts and even on dusty courts, you won't have any issues!"
8792,179,486,8.0,2021-06-14,traction,The traction is very solid.
8793,179,33,9.5,2021-06-21,cushion,The cushion is fantastic just like last year. This is the best balance of everything when it comes to cushioning in a basketball shoe.
8794,179,32,9.0,2021-05-04,cushion,The cushion on the KD14 feels great! It feels low-to-the-ground but you still get great impact protection.
8795,179,293,10.0,2021-05-10,cushion,Easily my favorite cushioning set up right now! You get a nice bounce from the Zoom Strobel when you are running and extra impact protection by the Cushlon foam on heavier impacts.
8796,179,1,10.0,2022-01-22,cushion,The full-length Cushlon and Zoom Strobel make the shoe ridiculously comfortable underfoot.
8797,179,7,9.0,2022-02-01,cushion,"The added Cushlon provides plenty of step-in comfort, and the Zoom Strobel helps the shoe feel cushy right out of the box."
8798,179,394,9.0,2022-01-22,cushion,"These still have the Zoom Strobel, but they don't have any additional Zoom units in the shoe. Despite this, it still feels comfortable and responsive because of the Cushlon."
8799,179,6,9.0,2021-05-04,cushion,The full-length Cushlon midsole with a Zoom Strobel unit feels very plush and comfortable. You get a lot of impact protection but you still feel quick on your feet - just a great combination of technologies.
8800,179,486,9.0,2021-06-14,cushion,The full-length Zoom in the KD 14 feels nice underfoot.
8801,179,33,9.0,2021-06-21,materials,"The materials hold up well and are fairly breathable. From a performance perspective, I have no issues. They get the job done."
8802,179,32,8.0,2021-05-04,materials,"The multi-layered Mesh materials are a big improvement compared to the KD13. They are comfortable, flexible but not very breathable."
8803,179,293,8.0,2021-05-10,materials,"The materials are thin, minimal, and conform nicely to your feet. The ankle is nicely padded and the tongue is comfortable as well. The strap is annoying when tying your shoes."
8804,179,1,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,"The materials are thicker and more maximalist for comfort compared to other shoes. However, they aren't great in terms of durability."
8805,179,7,7.5,2022-02-01,materials,"The base is screen mesh with some synthetic overlaying it. The materials feel cheap, but they do work."
8806,179,394,8.0,2022-01-22,materials,"The materials have a nice feel to them, and they are thicker than materials found on most basketball shoes."
8807,179,6,8.0,2021-05-04,materials,The top-level Mesh materials feel a little cheap but they get the job done and feel comfortable on foot.
8808,179,486,8.0,2021-06-14,materials,The multi-layer mesh on the upper makes the shoe feel and look premium. There's very minimal break-in time.
8809,179,33,9.0,2021-06-21,support,I did have issues getting the strap to stay down but the heel lockdown was still perfect. I am also pleasantly surprised with how wide they are and how well the outrigger works.
8810,179,32,9.0,2021-05-04,support,"The strap, the midfoot pieces on the sides, and the wide base combine to provide great support!"
8811,179,293,8.0,2021-05-10,support,"The strap adds support to the midfoot section. I had no issues with lateral support, and the internal heel counter prevented heel slippage."
8812,179,1,9.0,2022-01-22,support,The lateral bridge included in the midfoot really helps to discourage your foot from rolling over.
8813,179,7,9.0,2022-02-01,support,"The materials, internal heel counter, and lateral plate help keep your foot contained."
8814,179,6,8.0,2021-05-04,support,"The internal heel counter locks down the heel, I didn't have any side-to-side movement on the footbed, and the lateral stability was solid thanks to the wide base."
8815,179,486,9.0,2021-06-14,support,I do believe the strap will help improve the support of the shoe. There's also strategic replacement of thicker materials around the show to improve stability.
8816,179,33,9.0,2021-06-21,fit,"They fit pretty well for me when I went up half a size. Because of the upper being mostly a fuse shell, there isn't much stretch and it locks you down well."
8817,179,1,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,The fit will work for players with most foot shapes. The materials and support features also conform nicely to your foot.
8818,179,7,9.0,2022-02-01,fit,"It's a wider-looking shoe, but the last is actually narrow. If you don't like a snug fit, I'd suggest trying them on first. Once you do get the right size, they feel like a 1 to 1 fit."
8819,179,394,8.0,2022-01-22,fit,"The lacing system makes these easy to get on foot. However, there isn't much room in the toe box, so take that into consideration when deciding on fit."
8820,179,6,8.0,2021-05-04,fit,"The materials conform nicely to my feet, and the heel is locked in nicely, but there's a tiny bit of dead space in the toe box."
8821,179,486,8.0,2021-06-14,fit,The combination of the strap and materials on the shoe help keep the fit secure.
8822,179,293,50.0,2021-05-10,outdoor,Occasional outdoor use should be okay.
8823,179,1,50.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,"It doesn't use the most durable rubber, but the tread is deep."
8824,179,394,0.0,2022-01-22,outdoor,"The rubber feels soft, so it may not be the best for outdoor wear."
8825,179,293,1,2021-05-10,width,"For me the fit is perfect, but if you have wide feet you might need to go up a full size."
8826,179,1,2,2022-01-22,width,"If you have a wider foot, you might want to go up a half size."
8827,179,7,2,2022-02-01,width,The shoe fits narrow in the forefoot.
8828,179,394,2,2022-01-22,width,"If you have wider feet or like more room in the toe box, you might want to consider going up half a size."
8829,179,6,2,2021-05-04,width,As a slightly wide-footer I went true to size and it took a little to break in and become comfortable in the forefoot.
8830,179,486,2,2021-06-14,width,The toe box is kind of slim.
8831,179,293,3,2021-05-10,size,"If you have narrow feet go true to size, wider feet might need to go up in size."
8832,179,1,2,2022-01-22,size,"If you have longer toes or a wider foot, I would definitely go up half a size."
8833,179,7,2,2022-02-01,size,I went up half a size because the 10.5 was too small for me.
8834,179,394,3,2022-01-22,size,"I went true to size, and I was happy with the fit."
8835,179,6,3,2021-05-04,size,The KD 14 runs true to size.
8836,179,486,3,2021-06-14,size,"True to size felt perfect for me, but beware of the forefoot."
8837,180,6,8.4,2021-04-21,expert_overall,"For $70 retail, this is a banger of a shoe. If you are looking for impact protection, this shoe isn't for you. But everything else is really nice. The Nike Precision 5 is a great to shoe to play in and I honestly can't believe that it's only $70."
8838,180,293,8.4,2021-04-30,expert_overall,"If the Precision 5 was $120, I'd still recommend it because it performs extremely well. The only thing that's lacking is the cushion - and it's not that bad."
8839,180,19,7.5,2022-03-05,expert_overall,"Overall, the Nike Precision 5 has solid traction and a decent cushion. The materials also weren't bad for a budget shoe, but the fit is wonky."
8840,180,500,8.2,2022-02-20,user_overall,I really loved how it feels and the comfortablity is on another level. It would be my favorite show of all time is it had better grip. The grip started to have trouble grasping on to basketball courts and often made me fall after around 5 months of extreme use.
8841,180,498,8.0,2022-04-28,user_overall,The shoe can’t really handle dust but the materials feel pretty good for a 70$ shoe and I like that the shoe let’s the feet breath.
8842,180,501,9.5,2022-01-12,user_overall,One of the best pair of basketball shoes I have owned. I bought these on a whim and now I own 3 pairs of them.
8843,180,186,7.9,2023-03-18,user_overall,"Nothing special on this shoes, they are really bad on outdoor courts . Good shoe to lighter players"
8844,180,502,8.0,2023-02-20,user_overall,
8845,180,6,9.0,2021-04-21,traction,"The modified herringbone traction really bites on clean courts. On dustier courts, the occasional wipe may be needed, but traction will still be very solid. Overall, extremely nice."
8846,180,293,9.0,2021-04-30,traction,"Very solid and consistent bite with only a tiny bit of sliding on hard lateral movements. On dusty courts, frequent wiping was needed, but the bite is still very good with wiping."
8847,180,19,9.0,2022-03-05,traction,The traction is pretty damn good for a low-budget model shoe.
8848,180,6,8.0,2021-04-21,cushion,Cushioning is on the firmer side of things but feels good for the price. Provides a good amount of court feel in the forefoot with a tiny bit of bounce in the heel.
8849,180,293,7.0,2021-04-30,cushion,"There's a little bit of compression in the heel, but the forefoot cushion is pretty stiff. Not the best impact protection, but does provide a decent amount of court feel."
8850,180,19,7.0,2022-03-05,cushion,The cushion is not that bad. It has enough to provide decent performance.
8851,180,6,9.0,2021-04-21,materials,"The shoe features a fairly thick textile upper that feels pretty good to the touch. Has a bit of a thin tongue, but gets the job done for performance. Overall, it's really nice for the price point."
8852,180,293,9.0,2021-04-30,materials,"Materials are definitely my favorite part of the shoe. They have a very nice, soft textile material. I love it - very minimal, but very comfortable."
8853,180,19,7.0,2022-03-05,materials,The materials feel just okay.
8854,180,6,8.0,2021-04-21,support,"No issues with the support. The internal heel counter and very nice heel sculpting help with keeping you locked in. Midsole wraps onto the upper of the shoe, preventing you from slipping off the footbed."
8855,180,293,8.0,2021-04-30,support,Support and lockdown are good. I had no issues with lateral containment. Foam comes up on sidewall to help with containment and the shoe has a very good outrigger.
8856,180,6,8.0,2021-04-21,fit,I really liked the fit in the Precision 5 and the materials hug your feet nicely. It is very snug in the toebox with no dead space.
8857,180,293,9.0,2021-04-30,fit,Fit is phenomenal.
8858,180,19,7.0,2022-03-05,fit,The shoe fits long. I had about half a finger width of space in the front of the shoe.
8859,180,293,50.0,2021-04-30,outdoor,"Traction should be fine, but durability in high wear areas did not hold up well at all. Should be ok for the price, but don't expect it to last too long."
8860,180,293,3,2021-04-30,size,"True to size. Really snug in the toebox, pretty narrow as well."
8861,181,19,8.8,2022-03-11,expert_overall,Guards that are looking for court feel and traction will enjoy this shoe. I highly recommend playing in the Puma Court Rider.
8862,181,293,7.5,2021-06-22,expert_overall,"Overall, it is a comfortable and cozy feeling shoe, but it wasn't very responsive because the traction didn't perform well. The cushion is also pretty minimal, but that's understandable for a budget shoe like the Court Rider. I didn't really like playing in this shoe considering there are plenty of good options in the budget shoe price range."
8863,181,503,8.2,2022-05-31,user_overall,Traction is good if you play on clean courts but does pick up dust fast so I if you play on a dusty or semi dusty court I’d keep looking. Step in comfort is amazing my feet don’t hurt after playing in them
8864,181,504,7.8,2022-01-07,user_overall,"It was an all around good shoe, good for a guard but a little clunky feeling"

8868,181,19,10.0,2022-03-11,traction,This traction grips well on all surfaces. I highly recommend this shoe for guards looking for traction.
8869,181,293,6.0,2021-06-22,traction,"The traction is not good. I never have dust issues on the court I played on, but had issues with the Court Rider."
8870,181,19,9.0,2022-03-11,cushion,"The impact protection isn't the best, but I loved how the court feel of the shoe feels low to the ground. I didn't feel any pain either."
8871,181,293,7.0,2021-06-22,cushion,"The step-in comfort kind of sucks. In the heel, there is a bit of compression. The setup provides adequate impact protection but has good court feel."
8872,181,19,9.0,2022-03-11,materials,There are a lot of textile overlays on the shoe. I enjoy how the materials feel.
8873,181,293,8.0,2021-06-22,materials,"The quality of the materials isn't the best, but they do feel comfortable. Overall, it is cozy and minimal. One thing I encountered was that the shoe wasn't very breathable."
8874,181,19,8.0,2022-03-11,support,"The build of the shoe with its materials helps with the support. Support, containment, and heel lockdown are all solid."
8875,181,293,8.5,2021-06-22,support,"I had no issues with support and lockdown. In the forefoot, the synthetic leather and the Puma logo act as a sidewall to assist with lateral containment which worked well."
8876,181,19,8.0,2022-03-11,fit,I go down half a size to get a better fit length-wise for Puma basketball shoes.
8877,181,293,8.0,2021-06-22,fit,This shoe fits me really well.
8878,181,293,100.0,2021-06-22,outdoor,The rubber is pretty hard and the grooves are very thick. It should last outdoors.
8879,181,293,3,2021-06-22,size,I went true to size and it fits well.
8880,182,6,9.0,2021-03-12,expert_overall,The Under Armour Spawn 3 retails for just $100 and for the price it's a banger! A very very good performer - I have nothing bad to say about these.
8881,182,293,9.0,2021-03-12,expert_overall,Go get a pair! The Under Armour Spawn 3 is freaking phenomenal. My only minor issues are the heel curve and the durability of the outsole for outdoor use.
8882,182,266,9.0,2023-09-01,user_overall,"This shoe is for the cushion conessiour, tremendous shock absorption. Traction is good as well, may have to wipe from time to time but the outsole is very durable so that's a plus. Fit is a little bit on the narrow side in the toe box but the materials do stretch a little bit. The shoe does very well to lock down your foot to the foot bed, but the shape of the outsole could cause an ankle roll here and there until you get used to them. Wide footers go up half a size just to have a nice comfy fit"
8883,182,455,8.8,2022-02-09,user_overall,"Great shoe for guards to forwards. The shoe is ultralight, with a nice thin upper and minimal build. Upper is nice and breathable, and the overlays provide good protection from toe drags. The traction performs excellently on all surfaces, with or without dust, and the cushion was incredibly close to OG Micro G. Soft, responsive and didn’t bottom out. Awesome shoe for any player! FYI, the upper stretches out quite a bit, so that is a slight safety risk. Support is not exactly the best."
8884,182,507,9.2,2022-05-03,user_overall,"Just wanna put a perspective from someone who never owned BBall shoes before. This is the best pair of sports shoes I've ever owned. I'm using these for Badminton and Volleyball mostly. I have pretty wide flat feet and this is the first shoe that really fits like a glove. No wiggle room in the front, tight grip in the middle and firm fit on the heels with no slipping. Cushioning and traction are really good for what I do, but I can only compare them to Volleyball shoes."
8885,182,323,8.6,2022-10-31,user_overall,"Traction and Cushion are top tier on this shoe.Support after a long time is a bit inconsistent, because the materials stretched out too much.I had to go up half a size, because I have wide and high arched feet, but the shoe stretched out so I got blisters, which I managed to cure with switching "
8886,182,456,8.6,2022-01-13,user_overall,"The UA Spawn 3 is an overall good performer. The traction bites nice on all surfaces. The cushion is the real prize as we finally get REAL micro g in a basketball shoe! The materials are subpar and the fit is ok. The support was my main issue, I just didn’t feel as comfortable as I did in other models. Overall, for the price, the UA Spawn 3 is a shoe worth getting!"
8887,182,6,9.0,2021-03-12,traction,The traction and bite are really really good. Whether I was playing on a clean or dusty court I was good to go.
8888,182,293,10.0,2021-03-12,traction,The traction is freaking phenomenal! It was very consistent with a really hard stop on an outdoor court. They also felt great on my indoor floors.
8889,182,6,10.0,2021-03-12,cushion,The full-length Micro-G midsole felt amazing. It was soft and comfortable with good impact protection and court feel. A very well-balanced setup.
8890,182,293,10.0,2021-03-12,cushion,I absolutely love the full-length Micro-G cushion setup. The midsole is pretty thin which gives you a nice court feel while still being comfortable enough.
8891,182,6,8.0,2021-03-12,materials,"The mesh upper wasn't the most premium, but got the job done just fine performance wise. The materials felt really good on feet."
8892,182,293,8.0,2021-03-12,materials,The materials are just okay. They get the job done performance-wise and are comfortable on foot. I like the really thin upper.
8893,182,6,9.0,2021-03-12,support,I had absolutely zero issues with the support in these. My heel was locked in and I had no side to side movement on the footbed. I also never felt like my foot was going to roll over.
8894,182,293,8.0,2021-03-12,support,"I had no real issues with the support and lockdown. Lateral containment was nice, but lateral stability wasn't the best. The curve in the heel caused my foot to feel a little unstable. Everything else was solid."
8895,182,6,9.0,2021-03-12,fit,The fit was nice and snug with no dead space in the toe box. The shoe overall did a really good job of hugging my foot into the shoe.
8896,182,293,9.0,2021-03-12,fit,"The fit wasn't super snug, but it wasn't an issue for me. If you like a snug fit you should maybe look elsewhere. For me the fit was great and really easy to put on."
8897,182,293,50.0,2021-03-12,outdoor,The outsole durability was okay.

8900,183,33,9.0,2021-03-21,expert_overall,"Overall, I have loved playing in the Nike Cosmic Unity. They provide the stability and cushion I want and love. There's nothing I can complain about!"
8901,183,6,8.8,2021-03-21,expert_overall,The Nike Cosmic Unity retails for $150 and is a really solid shoe for the price. The only thing I didn't like in these was the traction on dust. I'm hoping the other colorways have better traction.
8902,183,293,8.8,2021-03-26,expert_overall,"The Cosmic Unity is super nice! Similar to the KD 13, but better quality and a little bulkier. I feel like any position or type of player would enjoy playing in these. These will be in my rotation and I really liked playing in them."
8903,183,2,8.6,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"The Nike Cosmic Unity is a great shoe. The cushion felt very good after breaking them in, and the materials feel premium. My only complaint about the shoe is the extra weight coming from the protruding heel cup."
8904,183,508,8.4,2022-01-26,user_overall,"I had a black outsole and the traction never panned out, on clean courts the bite is good not great, on dust the bite is decent, if dust is present you will be sliding frequently (Bla"
8905,183,509,7.3,2022-09-28,user_overall,These shoes have great traction for the first couple of wears then they collected dust and became terrible if your going to wear these shoes for a long period of time they can create blisters on the heel/ arch of the foot so wear thicker socks
8906,183,510,8.2,2023-01-27,user_overall,"overall, cosmic is pretty good but I think the fitting is pretty weird since the insole is very soft so it sometimes run big when tie laces tight."
8907,183,511,9.0,2021-10-27,user_overall,Good-looking colorway. Great material.

8909,183,33,9.0,2021-03-21,traction,The herringbone traction is a beautiful thing. Nothing too special about the outsole but herringbone just works well. I only got to play in these outdoors and the outsole did a great job.
8910,183,6,8.0,2021-03-21,traction,"The herringbone pattern is pretty spaced out here and worked well on clean courts. On dusty courts, I was sliding here and there even after some wiping."
8911,183,293,8.0,2021-03-26,traction,"The herringbone outsole performs pretty well. It doesn't have the best stop, but there weren't any slip outs and the experience was consistent overall."
8912,183,2,8.0,2021-05-06,traction,The cushion is good but not top-notch.
8913,183,33,9.0,2021-03-21,cushion,This cushion uses a full-length Zoom Air Strobel unit similar to the KD 12 and 13 but is low to the ground like a Kyrie. This gives you a ton of court feel without sacrificing too much cushion. I felt super stable and mobile at all times!
8914,183,6,9.0,2021-03-21,cushion,They use the same Air strobel unit as the KD 13 and have great impact protection and responsiveness. The court feel was also really good because the midsole sat very low to the ground. I am really happy with the cushion here.
8915,183,293,10.0,2021-03-26,cushion,"The cushion is my favorite part about the shoe! The full-length Zoom Strobel is very similar to the KD 13. It's bouncy with good impact protection, and great court feel. Overall, it's an ideal cushion setup."
8916,183,2,9.0,2021-05-06,cushion,"I needed to break in the cushion a bit because of the Phylon. Once broken in, I loved the feel of the full-length Zoom Strobel. It was very bouncy while staying low to the ground."
8917,183,33,9.0,2021-03-21,materials,"The upper is made of thick knit and textiles and it's really durable and needed almost no break-in time. It wasn't very breathable, but it's one of the nicer knit builds in recent years."
8918,183,6,9.0,2021-03-21,materials,The knit upper material is really nice. It feels good to the touch and I had no containment issues. Performance-wise these got the job done just fine.
8919,183,293,9.0,2021-03-26,materials,"The mostly recycled materials are pretty nice. A little stiff in the beginning, but the materials broke in well. These conformed to my foot quite well."
8920,183,2,9.0,2021-05-06,materials,"I needed a little bit of break-in time to get the upper to feel comfortable, but the knit material used does feel premium."
8921,183,33,9.0,2021-03-21,support,"The beefy midsole did a nice job of holding my foot in place in the forefoot, midfoot, and heel. As long as these fit you properly, you won't have to worry about support at all."
8922,183,6,9.0,2021-03-21,support,"I had absolutely zero issues with the support. There was no heel slippage or side-to-side movement on the footbed. Lateral stability was nice because of the wide base. Overall, the support is very good!"
8923,183,293,8.0,2021-03-26,support,"Support and lockdown are good. I had no lateral containment issues or problems with lateral stability. Heel slippage was an issue for me, but it didn't prevent me from having fun in these."
8924,183,2,9.0,2021-05-06,support,The upper is very supportive without feeling too rigid. The midsole also wraps up onto the midfoot to help keep you on the footbed. The Nike Cosmic Unity has top-notch support and lockdown.
8925,183,33,9.0,2021-03-21,fit,"I had a little heel slip initially, but when the shoe warmed up and became more flexible it wasn't an issue. Lockdown was solid through all of my wear and I had no issues."
8926,183,6,9.0,2021-03-21,fit,There is no dead space in the toe box. I really enjoyed the snug fit!
8927,183,293,9.0,2021-03-26,fit,The shoe fits me quite well and is easy to put on.
8928,183,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,I had no problems with the fit of the shoe. It's very comfortable once broken in.
8929,183,6,50.0,2021-03-21,outdoor,I had some fraying after playing in these outdoors.
8930,183,293,0.0,2021-03-26,outdoor,Durability is bad outdoors.
8931,183,293,2,2021-03-26,width,The width is normal to slightly narrow.
8932,183,2,2,2021-05-06,width,Go up half a size if you have a wide foot.
8933,183,293,3,2021-03-26,size,True to size should be good.
8934,183,2,3,2021-05-06,size,Go true to size for regular foot shape and half a size up for wide foot shape.
8935,184,348,8.6,2021-06-21,expert_overall,"Whether you’re a LeBron fan, a person who likes impact protection, or a newbie looking for a shoe that’ll get you started, I can definitely recommend these."
8936,184,6,8.4,2021-03-26,expert_overall,"The LeBron 18 Low retails for $160 and they are a pretty good performer. The materials could've been a bit better, but from a performance standpoint, they are really good."
8937,184,293,8.4,2021-03-26,expert_overall,"The LeBron 18 Low performs pretty well and I enjoyed playing in it. They will be in my rotation pretty loosely because I prefer other cushion setups, but overall these are solid."
8938,184,513,8.4,2022-06-15,user_overall,"I like how it looks, it’s unique with the bugs bunny & marvin the martians motives, calm colorway, two different colors and the words of bugs bunny and marvin the martians on each airmax, but still cool for casual wear. It's bouncy, snug fit, but when I used it for the first time playing basketball my feet got blisters on the bottom of the inner ankle, maybe because it was new and still stiff, but after I used it many times it became more flexible and comfortable. Unfortunately it's a bit heavy."
8939,184,514,8.6,2023-10-03,user_overall,this traction is such pretty good at indoor and at the
8940,184,458,10.0,2023-03-22,user_overall,Good for Outdoor  use and Indoor use as well

8943,184,348,8.0,2021-06-21,traction,The traction was good on most days with only some minor slips that mostly happened when they were relatively new.
8944,184,6,8.0,2021-03-26,traction,"These have basically the same outsole as the Lebron 18 and it works great on clean courts. When playing on mildly dusty courts, I slipped here and there and hard lateral movements weren't great."
8945,184,293,9.0,2021-03-26,traction,"The traction performs very well, maybe even a bit better than the regular LeBron 18. I had a very consistent and hard stop when I tested them outdoors."
8946,184,348,9.5,2021-06-21,cushion,"If you’re looking for a just-right plush, impact-protecting cushion, you’ll get it here."
8947,184,6,9.0,2021-03-26,cushion,The full-length React midsole and the 270 Air unit are very nice with lots of impact protection and bounce. The only bad thing about this cushion setup is that there isn't a lot of court feel and responsiveness.
8948,184,293,8.0,2021-03-26,cushion,The cushioning setup is crazy! The React felt really nice in the forefoot and the Air Max unit in the heel provides a ton of impact protection. The cushioning feels super comfortable but it's a little unstable and doesn't give you any court feel.
8949,184,348,7.5,2021-06-21,materials,We really should have gotten better quality materials for a shoe that’s priced at $160.
8950,184,6,8.0,2021-03-26,materials,The full-mesh upper doesn't feel great and is a little disappointing for this price point. Performance-wise it gets the job done well though and I can't complain. The Low version did a better job of keeping my foot on the footbed compared to the regular Lebron 18.
8951,184,293,8.0,2021-03-26,materials,"The materials are really nice. Quality isn't the best, but the upper is thin and comfortable. They conformed to my foot well and are pretty supportive."
8952,184,348,8.5,2021-06-21,support,"The addition of small outriggers compared to the original Lebron 18 added lateral stability. Added fuse keeps your feet from rolling over, but the high off the ground Air Max unit feels a little wobbly."
8953,184,6,9.0,2021-03-26,support,I had absolutely zero issues with support in this shoe. I had no heel slippage or side-to-side movement on the footbed. Lateral stability was solid as well. The support was an upgrade over the regular Lebron 18.
8954,184,293,8.0,2021-03-26,support,"I had no issues with lateral containment, but lateral stability wasn't the best. There is no outrigger and the Air Max unit caused some instability. Overall, the support is decent."
8955,184,348,9.5,2021-06-21,fit,The soft materials provided a snug and comfortable fit.
8956,184,6,8.0,2021-03-26,fit,Overall the fit is pretty good. There wasn't much dead space in the toe box and everywhere else was pretty snug.
8957,184,293,9.0,2021-03-26,fit,The fit is pretty snug and there isn't much dead space in the toe box. This was a great fit for me and it didn't stretch out at all.
8958,184,293,0.0,2021-03-26,outdoor,The outsole isn't durable enough for outdoor use.
8959,184,293,2,2021-03-26,width,Width is slightly narrow.
8960,184,6,3,2021-03-26,size,These fit true to size.
8961,184,293,3,2021-03-26,size,True to size fit me very well.
8962,185,516,9.0,2021-04-23,expert_overall,Overall the New Balance Two Wxy is a great all-around performer that any type of player can play in!
8963,185,293,8.8,2021-04-23,expert_overall,Overall the New Balance TWO WXY is very minimal and lightweight on foot and performs very well. Most types of players and play styles should be able to play in these. I'd 100% recommend getting them.
8964,185,231,8.6,2023-08-26,user_overall,"This is not a shoe for someone who wants maximum cushioning, however the FuelCell foam does far exceed the cushioning you'd expect for a shoe with this much bio feedback. The traction is amazing and really allows lighter gaurds to take advantage of their first step. The shoe fits like a glove and because of that offers very good lateral stability, but is lacking on ankle support. It plays well outdoors although probably shouldn't be played outdoors too often because of its average durability."
8965,185,517,8.2,2022-10-06,user_overall,I played in this shoe for 1 year and it has at best an average traction. The shoe is completely useless on dusty courts. There's barely any impact protection either. The rest is ok

8969,185,516,9.0,2021-04-23,traction,The traction performed phenomenally well. I didn't have to wipe at all and the bite was super strong.
8970,185,293,10.0,2021-04-23,traction,This traction pattern has the ultimate grip! Traction is really really good and very consistent. I had no problems with these slipping out or anything.
8971,185,516,10.0,2021-04-23,cushion,"The cushion is sensational! This setup is very low to the ground with amazing court feel, comfort, and a little bounce."
8972,185,293,8.0,2021-04-23,cushion,The Fuel Cell cushion is caged pretty heavily and provides a very low-to-the-ground ride with a little bit of bounce. The court feel is nice and the impact protection is decent but my feet hurt on heavier impacts.
8973,185,516,8.0,2021-04-23,materials,"The upper is mostly knit and gets the job done. The quality of the materials is average, but I had no complaints when it comes to performance."
8974,185,293,9.0,2021-04-23,materials,"The mesh and textile materials in the upper are really thin and feel great on foot. They aren't the most premium, but they get the job done and are comfortable."
8975,185,516,9.0,2021-04-23,support,The support was nice - I had no issues. The laces provide a lot of lockdown and the upper hugs your feet nicely.
8976,185,293,9.0,2021-04-23,support,"Support and lockdown are very, very nice. My foot wasn't going anywhere and lateral containment and stability were excellent. Ankle support was also good."
8977,185,516,9.0,2021-04-23,fit,"I have narrow feet and these fit me pretty snug, but it was a good snug! Wide footers should avoid this shoe altogether."
8978,185,293,8.0,2021-04-23,fit,"True to size worked for me, but these fit a little weird for me since they were long and narrow. They were pretty easy to put on as well."
8979,185,293,50.0,2021-04-23,outdoor,"The durability outdoors was okay, but not the best option."
8980,185,293,1,2021-04-23,width,These were very narrow. Check out the wide sizes.
8981,186,32,9.5,2021-02-13,expert_overall,"For $110, the PG 5 has a good amount of tech, really nice cushioning, and performs well in all aspects. There is some room for improvement when it comes to the quality of the materials."
8982,186,6,8.8,2021-02-13,expert_overall,"The PG 5 is a very solid performer. I wish the materials were a bit nicer, but at a $110 price point, I can't complain!"
8983,186,293,8.8,2021-02-13,expert_overall,"The PG 5 is a very solid performer. They are lightweight and I never had to worry when I played in them. Overall, there weren't many bad things I could say about these."
8984,186,33,8.6,2021-05-26,expert_overall,The PG5 is very good in most areas with the only downside being that the cushion didn't really perform well outdoors. They should be very good if you are playing indoors.
8985,186,45,8.6,2021-09-13,expert_overall,The Nike PG5s cushion and traction are incredible. The materials perform nicely on the court as well. The shoe has just about everything you need from your hoop shoe.
8986,186,2,8.2,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"Overall, the shoe has durable materials, is very supportive, and the cushion provides very nice impact protection. The traction actually grips very hard and is very stable to play in."
8987,186,518,7.0,2021-12-13,user_overall,"This shoe was amazing when I first got it. Probably my favorite shoe ever at the beginning. Sadly, the shoes lack of durability started to show. Within a month rips were occurring and even the sole was starting to rip away from the edge of the shoe. This problem caused me to roll my ankle as it got caught on the floor sometimes. The air bubble support did not last super long as I found myself running on little support. Sad to see such a great shoe get ruined by its durability."
8988,186,214,8.6,2023-03-31,user_overall,"The traction pattern is a close copy of the Kobe 9, which means traction is amazing. The cushioning is a slight step down from the PG 4, but the firmer materials may contribute to the fantastic traction. The full length zoom air weld dots provide a super smooth ride. You do have to lace these down tight for good containment on hard cuts due to a wide forefoot. This can cause some top of foot pain, which could have been solved with a slightly thicker tongue."
8989,186,508,9.2,2022-01-26,user_overall,"The traction is top tier, very very good on dust, one wipe and good to go.( Break in peri"
8990,186,76,8.7,2022-06-14,user_overall,"your feet can get tired in this shoe after a while as it’s only air strobe instead of zoom, the traction is good but you HAVE TO WIPE CONSTANTLY or you will slide out big time. the lateral outrigger keeps you stable, however i have rolled my ankle because of if you go over the outrigger, it can hurt. materials, after using them for a very long time, have busted in the big toe / ball if your foot area (common in the pg line, from my experience pg 3)"
8991,186,519,8.2,2022-06-13,user_overall,"Played in these shoes a lot for the past 5 months. Even on dusty courts the traction was great with just a bit a wiping every now and then. Impact protection was pretty good. My feet hurt every now and then but only after playing in them for a while. The only big problem for me was the durability. My shoes almost have a hole in the side and the insole is completely destroyed. Overall though, a great shoe, especially for the price."
8992,186,32,9.0,2021-02-13,traction,The outsole reminds me of the Kobe 9 (which had great traction). The traction grips really well and provided me with a nice bite.
8993,186,6,10.0,2021-02-13,traction,The traction pattern has been reused from the Kobe 9 and it's top-tier!
8994,186,293,10.0,2021-02-13,traction,"This traction pattern is basically the same as the Kobe 9 which had GOAT traction. I only got to try these outdoors, but they were phenomenal. One thing that surprised me is that they don't squeak at all."
8995,186,33,10.0,2021-05-26,traction,"The traction is a copy of the Kobe 9, which is one of the greatest of all time."
8996,186,45,9.0,2021-09-13,traction,The cushion has never failed us when playing. The bite is sensational with minimal dust pickup.
8997,186,2,9.0,2021-05-06,traction,"After a bit of a break-in period, the traction became really good. It gripped very hard and picked up very little dust."
8998,186,32,9.0,2021-02-13,cushion,"Just like last year's model, the PG5 has a full-length Air Strobel unit. The cushion feels great and is more responsive compared to the PG 4."
8999,186,6,9.0,2021-02-13,cushion,"The PG 5 features a full-length Phylon midsole and an Air Strobel unit. Personally, I liked the setup in the PG 4 a little better because they were softer, but the PG 5s are more responsive."
9000,186,293,9.0,2021-02-13,cushion,The cushion looks pretty similar to the PG 4 but feels very different. The PG 5 cushion is a lot lower to the ground and the PSI felt a lot lower in the Air unit. Impact protection is really good and court feel is nice.
9001,186,33,8.0,2021-05-26,cushion,It doesn't quite feel like last year's model because of the foam used. It feels more firm. It should work indoors but didn't provide much for outdoor play.
9002,186,45,10.0,2021-09-13,cushion,"The full-length Air Strobel is a top-tier cushioning setup from Nike, and it doesn't disappoint in the PG5. It's responsive, comfortable, and provides a solid court feel."
9003,186,2,8.0,2021-05-06,cushion,It has a full-length Air Strobel which is very comfy. It provides a good amount of impact protection but lacks some bounciness.
9004,186,32,8.0,2021-02-13,materials,"The materials aren't great and don't feel very premium. However, they are lightweight, flexible, require no break-in time, and get the job done performance-wise."
9005,186,6,8.0,2021-02-13,materials,The Mesh materials look and feel a bit cheap but they get the job done just fine performance-wise.
9006,186,293,7.0,2021-02-13,materials,"The material quality is not great. It seems cheap and reminded me a lot of the PG 2. As you break-in the materials they get pretty soft and feel nice on foot though. For the price, you can't complain."
9007,186,33,8.0,2021-05-26,materials,"The materials feel cheap but in terms of performance, it's way better than last year's model. They got the job done."
9008,186,45,9.0,2021-09-13,materials,Textile mesh with some leather overlays spread throughout. We love it. It's flexible and lightweight.
9009,186,2,8.0,2021-05-06,materials,The upper is mainly made of mesh with a touch of synthetic materials throughout. There's no break-in time needed and is very durable.
9010,186,32,9.0,2021-02-13,support,"The PG 5 provides very good lateral stability. Nothing else was crazy lockdown-wise, but they were solid all around."
9011,186,6,9.0,2021-02-13,support,The support is really good. I had no issues with the lateral stability or containment and my foot felt locked down on the footbed.
9012,186,293,9.0,2021-02-13,support,The support and lockdown are really good thanks to the wide base and nice outrigger. I had no issues with lateral containment and stability.
9013,186,33,8.0,2021-05-26,support,The shoe feels wider than the Kobe 9 and they added an outrigger so you really do feel locked down.
9014,186,45,7.0,2021-09-13,support,It has everything you need for support. The only downside is that the laces become slightly loose towards the ankle collar.
9015,186,2,8.0,2021-05-06,support,The heel counter and padding provide a very good amount of lockdown in the back of the shoe. The shoe also covers you well on lateral movements.
9016,186,32,8.0,2021-02-13,fit,These ran a little short for me and were a snug fit overall. Overall comfort was good and I didn't have any issues with that.
9017,186,6,8.0,2021-02-13,fit,The fit is slightly narrow and snug similar to other PG models. They stretched out a little after breaking them in and the overall fit was nice.
9018,186,293,9.0,2021-02-13,fit,"The toe box wasn't as snug as I'd like it to be, but there wasn't a ton of extra material. For the most part the fit was really good for me and these were easy to put on which is always a plus."
9019,186,33,9.0,2021-05-26,fit,I love the way they fit. They really remind me of the Kobe 5 which had a great fit.
9020,186,45,8.0,2021-09-13,fit,It has an above-average fit that feels nice.
9021,186,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,"They fit pretty nicely if you have a regular or narrow foot, but can get snug in the forefoot area."
9022,186,293,0.0,2021-02-13,outdoor,The durability outdoors is terrible.
9023,186,2,100.0,2021-05-06,outdoor,I played in the XDR version of the shoe which is meant to perform better outdoors.
9024,186,6,2,2021-02-13,width,I recommend going up half a size if you have wide feet.
9025,186,293,2,2021-02-13,width,I'd go up half a size if you have wide feet or like a roomy fit.
9026,186,45,3,2021-09-13,width,They accommodate slightly wide feet with no problems.
9027,186,2,2,2021-05-06,width,"The shoe is kind of narrow around the forefoot area. If you have a wide foot, it'll be better to try them out in-store beforehand."
9028,186,6,3,2021-02-13,size,True to size should work well.
9029,186,293,3,2021-02-13,size,True to size fit me very well.
9030,186,45,3,2021-09-13,size,True to size for sure.
9031,186,2,3,2021-05-06,size,The PG5 runs true to size for regular and narrow footers.
9032,187,307,8.8,2022-06-14,expert_overall,"Li-Ning's Way of Wade 9 Infinity is a pricey shoe, but it provides plenty of performance and durability for the price."
9033,187,1,8.4,2022-04-19,expert_overall,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade 9 performs well for players looking for front-to-back speed, but they aren't the best for those that like to feel low to the ground."
9034,187,293,8.2,2022-02-18,expert_overall,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade 9 Infinity is a solid all-around shoe. The traction bites, the cushion is alright, and the support is there too."
9035,187,520,9.2,2022-11-24,user_overall,They are good shoes. They are just expensive but they can blister.

9037,187,307,9.0,2022-06-14,traction,I had no issues with stopping on a dime. The traction is pretty good overall.
9038,187,1,10.0,2022-04-19,traction,I think the traction is the best part of the shoe. I found the grip to be tremendous.
9039,187,293,8.0,2022-02-18,traction,"The traction is really good once broken in, but it starts poorly. Dust and debris do give the traction trouble."
9040,187,307,9.0,2022-06-14,cushion,The cushion feels nice and springy when I elevate to take jump shots. The shoe feels very comfortable too.
9041,187,1,8.0,2022-04-19,cushion,"Because of the rocker and the high stack of Boom cushioning, this shoe performs best when you're going in straight lines. You also feel springy in the shoe."
9042,187,293,7.0,2022-02-18,cushion,"There is a lot of Boom cushioning used in this shoe. The court feel isn't the best, and impact protection is okay."
9043,187,307,9.0,2022-06-14,materials,"The materials aren't the lightest, but they aren't too heavy either. The shoe also feels breathable."
9044,187,1,8.0,2022-04-19,materials,"The shroud is thin and flimsy, but the materials are durable where it counts."
9045,187,293,9.0,2022-02-18,materials,"The shroud feels nice and thin. There isn't a lot of padding, but the shoe feels minimal. I also really like the lacing system."
9046,187,307,9.0,2022-06-14,support,"The shoe moved well with my cuts, and that helped me feel stable. My ankle felt supported as well."
9047,187,1,8.0,2022-04-19,support,"For low-top shoes, they do a great job of securing your foot."
9048,187,293,8.0,2022-02-18,support,"Laterally, I had no issues with containment or stability. I did experience some heel slippage, though."

9052,187,307,100.0,2022-06-14,outdoor,I feel like the shoe is going to last a long time.
9053,187,1,100.0,2022-04-19,outdoor,"The outsole is dense, hard rubber."
9054,187,293,100.0,2022-02-18,outdoor,"The rubber is extremely hard, and the grooves are thick."
9055,187,293,1,2022-02-18,width,I wouldn't recommend this shoe for people with wide feet.
9056,187,1,3,2022-04-19,size,I recommend going true to size if you have a narrow or medium-sized foot.
9057,187,293,3,2022-02-18,size,I went true to size and enjoyed the fit.
9058,188,293,8.2,2022-02-18,expert_overall,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade 9 offers premium features and materials. It could be lighter, and the cushion could be a bit more responsive, but I have no complaints other than that."

9062,188,293,8.0,2022-02-18,cushion,"There isn't much compression from the foam in the shoe because the midsole is caged, but there is plenty of step-in comfort. It's a nice setup that offers a decent court feel."
9063,188,293,8.0,2022-02-18,materials,The materials are thin and stretchy but have a layer of fuse to offer extra durability. It still feels minimal and comfortable on foot.
9064,188,293,9.0,2022-02-18,support,"Laterally, I had no issues because of the plastic plate at the side and the heel counter. Heel slippage and lateral stability were also non-issues."

9066,188,293,50.0,2022-02-18,outdoor,Durability should be ok.
9067,189,522,7.6,2021-02-01,expert_overall,"The Harden Volume 5 uses ""new tech"" for the sake of using ""new tech"". At $130 these aren't super expensive, but they don't do anything better than their predecessors and that is generous. I don't recommend these."
9068,189,293,7.0,2021-02-03,expert_overall,"I really wanted to like the Harden Volume 5, but I'm super disappointed with the performance of these. I'll probably never ball in them again, and I don't recommend them."
9069,189,6,6.6,2021-01-23,expert_overall,"The Harden Vol. 5 retails for $130 and considering the problems I had, these are a no go. I highly recommend staying away from this shoe unless you are a big Harden fan."
9070,189,32,6.5,2020-12-25,expert_overall,The Harden Vol. 5 comes in at $130 which isn't bad for a signature shoe but is too much considering the performance of these. Unless you're a diehard Harden fan I can't see anyone hooping in these.
9071,189,523,6.0,2022-10-19,user_overall,"I buy this shoes here in Chile one year ago, the worst things about them is It weight. It feels todo heavy and uncomfortable, My feet sometimes hurt after or during a Game. The things i like are the desing, and the outdoor performace beacuse they work very well even after hours of playing"
9072,189,258,6.4,2023-10-28,user_overall,"Really disappointed in these. Got them for retail when they came out. Wore them 3 times and they were a disappointment. I got blisters, my foot hurt a lot, traction is awful. Only great thing is cushion. Do not buy these if you care about your feet."
9073,189,372,6.8,2022-08-23,user_overall,A very bulky and heavy shoe.Its a great shoe for playing outdoors but not great overall.Both the traction and the cushion ain't outstanding.I wouldn't recommend this shoe.
9074,189,524,8.0,2022-01-19,user_overall,"Very good shoe. Traction is very good after breaking in , some times need to wipe. Cushion is very bad. Very stiff"
9075,189,525,10.0,2022-03-12,user_overall,Best shoe ever created nothing will ever be wrong with it or the beard that comes with it.
9076,189,522,8.0,2021-02-01,traction,The traction is good on clean courts or after wiping but doesn't keep the dirt away well.
9077,189,293,7.0,2021-02-03,traction,"The traction was a little weird and reminded me a lot of the Jordan 31. It's really good on side-to-side movements, but I had some slipping issues with linear moves. I only got to try these outdoors."
9078,189,6,5.0,2021-01-23,traction,"The traction is absolutely terrible. On the cleanest courts I could find, I would slide to a stop, and on courts with average dust it was awful."
9079,189,32,7.0,2020-12-25,traction,"The traction took a while to break in and was disappointing even then. On clean courts it was okay, but with any dust, I had a lot of grip issues."
9080,189,522,6.0,2021-02-01,cushion,The drop-in Boost insole was a big problem for me. There was a ton of slope around the heel that didn't let my foot sit properly in the shoe and caused a ton of heel slip. Even worse was the stiff shank on the bottom of the insole. It never broke in and was super stiff.
9081,189,293,7.0,2021-02-03,cushion,"There is no exposed midsole cushion at all, but there are Boost and Lightstrike drop-in soles. There is some slight compression in the heel, but everywhere else you don't feel anything. I think the drop in insole was just too thin."
9082,189,6,7.0,2021-01-23,cushion,"This cushion setup is pretty similar to the Pro Boost and I got a lot of court feel and responsiveness, but the impact protection was definitely lacking. I also don't like how hard it is to flex this shoe."
9083,189,32,7.0,2020-12-25,cushion,"With the combination of Boost and Lightstrike, I expected this cushion to be great. Unfortunately, it is bottom-heavy and rigid. Pretty comfortable and responsive, but just doesn't flex well."
9084,189,522,8.0,2021-02-01,materials,These materials feel like a throwback to 2010 or 2012 and aren't premium to the touch at all. I didn't have any issues with pinching or hot spots though.
9085,189,293,6.0,2021-02-03,materials,The materials are pretty bad. The upper is super fused and glued down which provides a super-stiff feeling - not cozy or comfortable at all.
9086,189,6,7.0,2021-01-23,materials,"The upper is very plasticky and doesn't feel great to the touch or very premium. It offers a lot of containment because of how rigid it is, but I'm not a huge fan of the materials."
9087,189,32,6.0,2020-12-25,materials,"The materials are just not good. They are very hard, not flexible, and not breathable. They do not feel very premium and overall are disappointing."
9088,189,522,9.0,2021-02-01,support,I had no issues with support and stability. These were just a wide as the Volume 3 in the forefoot and wider in the heel.
9089,189,293,7.0,2021-02-03,support,"Lateral containment is really really good in these, but heel lockdown is terrible. Even with the nice Achilles pads, my foot wanted to pop out the whole time. I had no issues with lateral stability."
9090,189,6,6.0,2021-01-23,support,"The support in the Vol. 5 was not good. The Achilles pillows felt nice, but didn't do their job very well and I had a ton of heel slippage. I could easily slide my foot out of the shoe even with the laces cranked down. These did have decent lateral support though."
9091,189,32,8.0,2020-12-25,support,"The lateral stability is good with a very wide base. I did have heel slippage even with the thick Achilles cushion pillows, so I had to tie down the laces a lot."
9092,189,522,7.0,2021-02-01,fit,The Volume 5 is a lot bigger than normal sized shoes and was hard to feel nimble in. I did like the lack of headspace in the forefoot and there wasn't any side to side movement on the footbed. Again heel slippage was an issue.
9093,189,293,8.0,2021-02-03,fit,"These run super long, so I went down half a size. The toe box is really snug and the overall fit is okay."
9094,189,6,8.0,2021-01-23,fit,The fit is pretty good and the materials conform nicely to your feet. The overall fit was decent.
9095,189,32,6.0,2020-12-25,fit,"The Harden Vol. 5  a little long in the toe, but not enough that I had to go down half a size. Overall they just weren't comfortable and I had a lot of pain in my midfoot to the point where I had to stop playing in them."
9096,189,293,100.0,2021-02-03,outdoor,Durability was good outdoors.
9097,189,6,2,2021-01-23,width,If you have wide feet be cautious with these because it is a bit tight in the midfoot area.
9098,189,293,3,2021-02-03,size,Go down half a size from your Adidas size.
9099,189,6,4,2021-01-23,size,These run a half size big.

9101,190,9,9.0,2024-04-21,expert_overall,"The Nike Kobe 6 Protro is my go-to shoe for games. I love the traction performance, and the cushioning moulds to my foot."
9102,190,6,8.6,2021-01-13,expert_overall,"The Kobe 6 Protro is a great performer and I really enjoyed every single aspect of the shoe. The traction is amazing and the cushion feels nice and smooth. It's a good blend of court feel, responsiveness, and impact protection. I don't regret getting these at all."
9103,190,2,8.4,2021-05-16,expert_overall,"I really liked playing in the Kobe 6 Protro. It is a low-profile shoe that has the right balance of responsiveness, bounciness, and impact protection. The only downside is that it's hard to get your hands on a pair."
9104,190,526,9.8,2024-01-08,user_overall,"The shoe is very light compared to other shoes I’ve worn but will not specify. This shoe feels like a boost due to its Zoom Turbo technology and lightweight construction, propelling me into explosive jumps. Because it is so light, it is perfectly suited for a shifty guard like myself who relies on fast lateral movements and changes of direction. The light weight also contributes to higher jumps. Support is 8.5/10 considering it's a low-top shoe."
9105,190,413,9.2,2023-02-04,user_overall,"The only complaint i got is the durability. As an outdoor Hooper, it's tough for me to wear this often as the traction will be gone if i play in it frequently. It is wide foot friendly, i went down a full size and i still fitted. Other than that, this shoe is extremely amazing. I highly recommend buying it even if it's reps/fake as the rep/fake review i watched once on YouTube was positive as hell."
9106,190,527,8.2,2022-11-09,user_overall,"I'm surprised how low my rating is for these, but I've worn them a dozen times probably and the materials are starting to spread. I love the grip, and fit on them. More of a long thin fit but very light weight and that's why I love them. I feel super bouncy in them but I'm afraid I'm going to slide out of the side of the shoe, being more explosive than most."
9107,190,357,9.8,2023-12-18,user_overall,Best basketball shoe I have ever used. The traction is incredible on both clean and dusty courts. The support for a low top is unbelievable while the materials are all solid and durable. My only downsides are that the shoe lacks ankle support (which is expected for low tops) and that the shoe has very limited court feel.
9108,190,528,9.6,2024-01-25,user_overall,"Great shoes with great perfomance. Traction is amazing in all the gyms - clean or dusty. Cushion is great very comfortable. Overall amazing shoes, imo the best perfomance shoes, but you can't play in them outdoors because sole is rather soft. And my recommendation is to go half size up."
9109,190,7,9.5,2024-06-02,traction,The traction performance is amazing after breaking in the rubber compound. It takes about an hour.
9110,190,9,10.0,2024-04-21,traction,I grade the traction performance 10 out of 10. It performs well in all court conditions.
9111,190,6,10.0,2021-01-13,traction,It features the same pattern as the original Kobe 6 and it's insane. One of the best traction setups ever. It only needed minimal amounts of wiping.
9112,190,2,9.0,2021-05-16,traction,"The traction is on point. It gripped pretty well, even on dusty courts. I had no problem with dust pickup."
9113,190,7,9.0,2024-06-02,cushion,"The Cushlon feels springy, and the full-length forefoot Zoom Turbo feels very responsive. It almost feels better than the original."
9114,190,9,9.0,2024-04-21,cushion,The Kobe 6 insole is the best insole I've played in. I like the Cushlon foam under the heel. There's lots of compression.
9115,190,6,9.0,2021-01-13,cushion,I'm glad they added the Zoom Turbo unit in the forefoot. The Cushlon feels amazing and isn't too soft like it was in the Kobe Protro 5.
9116,190,2,9.0,2021-05-16,cushion,"You'll feel the forefoot Zoom Turbo straight out of the box. Coupled with the Cushlon foam, the impact protection is very nice."
9117,190,7,9.5,2024-06-02,materials,"The material takes a few hours to break in, but they feel good afterwards. I like the flywire for support, too. I enjoy how form-fitting the shoe feels."
9118,190,9,9.0,2024-04-21,materials,There is a mix of mesh and textile materials on the upper. The shoe is lightweight and comfortable.
9119,190,6,8.0,2021-01-13,materials,"It's a textile upper that doesn't differ much from the original, but it still feels good on foot when you're playing in it."
9120,190,2,8.0,2021-05-16,materials,The upper is made of a mix of mesh and fuse scales and they are very good for performance. They aren't there just for aesthetics.
9121,190,7,9.5,2024-06-02,support,"The heel counter is fantastic, and the laces with the flywire keep you contained excellently."
9122,190,9,9.0,2024-04-21,support,"I like the carbon fibre plate, since I prefer extra torsional support. The support feels great."
9123,190,6,8.0,2021-01-13,support,I had no issues with the support in this model. The materials do a great job of keeping your foot contained on the footbed.
9124,190,2,8.0,2021-05-16,support,The materials help keep my foot secure on lateral movements. The shoe has ample heel containment and ankle support for a low-cut sneaker.
9125,190,7,9.5,2024-06-02,fit,"The fit is incredibly snug. The more you wear the shoe, the more it conforms to your feet."
9126,190,9,8.0,2024-04-21,fit,The fit is slightly snug.
9127,190,6,8.0,2021-01-13,fit,It fits like every other Kobe model.
9128,190,2,8.0,2021-05-16,fit,The fit is very snug. It fits me well and helps to keep me locked in.
9129,190,9,100.0,2024-04-21,outdoor,The outsole works well outdoors.
9130,190,6,0.0,2021-01-13,outdoor,The rubber is on the softer side and I don't think it will last.
9131,190,9,2,2024-04-21,width,The width is slightly narrow.
9132,190,6,2,2021-01-13,width,"Like most Kobe's, the Protro 6s run a bit narrow, so if you have wide feet, I would suggest going up half a size."
9133,190,2,2,2021-05-16,width,"The shoe fits narrow so if you have a wide foot, go up half a size."
9134,190,9,2,2024-04-21,size,I have to go up a full size because of my wider foot.
9135,190,6,3,2021-01-13,size,"I would say go true to size if you want a nice snug fit, but if your feet are wider, you may want to go up half a size."
9136,190,2,3,2021-05-16,size,"Regular footers go true to size, wide footers go up half a size."
9137,191,6,8.4,2021-01-23,expert_overall,The Harden Stepback 2 retails for $80 and I would definitely recommend it. You get solid all-around basketball shoes that perform better than the much more expensive Harden Vol. 5.
9138,191,293,8.2,2021-01-23,expert_overall,"For only $80 retail, the Harden Stepback 2 is a great performer. They are a little bottom heavy and I had some heel slippage issues, but other than that, I really like this shoe!"
9139,191,224,8.4,2022-11-20,user_overall,"I loved it, I played in this shoe only outdoor's for 10 straight months and they were amazing, the traction is pretty good, the cushion is the only real downside, the impact protection was bad, support is decent like I had very few issues with the support of the shoe but is not great either, materials and fit especially for that price were both amazing, really comfortable and really good court feel, the durability is awesome, hold it up pretty well for 10 months only on outdoors."
9140,191,529,6.8,2022-03-13,user_overall,The most notable problem are the piss poor laces which are so thin they are an absolute pain to tie. This would be fine if the fit wasnt so damn loose around the heel. Everywhere else its a great fit for people with wider feet such as mine. It is also unable to be used indoors at a high level after much outdoor use. The rubber will quickly be pealed off and worn down.
9141,191,372,8.4,2022-07-17,user_overall,Its a very good shoe especially for dunking.Its also a responsive shoe but not for fast players cause its a bit bulky and heavy.I liked that shoe and i would recommend it for both harden fans and players who are not fast but want a shoe in a good price.The only negatives are that it is a heavy shoe and i experienced some heel slippage.
9142,191,530,8.8,2021-10-25,user_overall,"This shoe is a budget shoe that has one of the best performance in the harden line. It has  great traction, materials and fit. This shoe is likely to be for Guards to play on, however it's a narrow shoe so if you have a regular feet or flat feet you should add at least half a size or one. Overall, for a $65 shoe, it's amazing!"
9143,191,247,8.8,2023-01-12,user_overall,Amazing court feel I don’t exactly know what kind of sole they used but it feels super close to the ground. The support is okay(I wear braces) One of the most comfortable basketball shoes I ever played with but they wore off after a while so I switched to Lukas. Still missing these tho
9144,191,6,9.0,2021-01-23,traction,"I'm pretty sure the Stepback 2 uses the exact same traction pattern as the disappointing Harden Vol. 5. Here the traction was actually really good. Great bite on clean courts, and a little wiping required on dust."
9145,191,293,8.0,2021-01-23,traction,The traction is pretty good. I slipped out a few times but overall the bite was really good.
9146,191,6,8.0,2021-01-23,cushion,"The cushion features full-length Bounce and is a little firmer compared to other shoes using Bounce. You get a lot of court feel and responsiveness, as well as decent impact protection and bounce out of this setup."
9147,191,293,7.0,2021-01-23,cushion,"The Bounce cushioning midsole is really thin and not as soft as usual. The court feel is really good, but there is not a lot of impact protection or compression."
9148,191,6,9.0,2021-01-23,materials,"The full textile upper was pretty nice, especially for the price. The materials are soft to the touch and conform nicely to your feet. I liked these materials a lot better than the materials of the Volume 5."
9149,191,293,9.0,2021-01-23,materials,"For an $80 shoe, the materials are really nice. The look is pretty premium and the materials feel great on foot."
9150,191,6,8.0,2021-01-23,support,The support is pretty good. The external heel counter helped lock down my heel and the lateral containment is decent. It has pretty much everything you want support wise.
9151,191,293,8.0,2021-01-23,support,I had absolutely zero issues with lateral containment which was kind of surprising. Lateral stability was nice even without an outrigger. One thing I struggled with a little was heel slippage when I was breaking these in.
9152,191,6,8.0,2021-01-23,fit,This shoe is pretty narrow in the midfoot and forefoot area similar to other Harden models. The materials broke in well and loosened up a bit after some use. There is no dead space in the toe box and overall the fit is good.
9153,191,293,9.0,2021-01-23,fit,The Harden Stepback 2 fit me like a glove and with no dead space in the toe box. The half bootie construction makes the overall fit really nice.
9154,191,293,100.0,2021-01-23,outdoor,The durability of the rubber was insanely good.
9155,191,293,2,2021-01-23,width,If you have wide feet I'd suggest going up half a size or maybe even a full size.
9156,191,293,3,2021-01-23,size,I went true to my Adidas size.
9157,192,293,8.6,2021-01-23,expert_overall,The Why Not Zero.4 is a solid performer. I especially liked the double-stacked Zoom units!
9158,192,6,8.4,2021-02-03,expert_overall,"For $130, I wouldn't recommend the Why Not Zero.4 just because of the inconsistent traction. It was just enough to cause me to not enjoy playing in the shoe. If you are a very linear player who doesn't make a lot of lateral movements you can probably get away with these."
9159,192,45,8.0,2021-09-29,expert_overall,"The Jordan Why Not Zero.4 does the job done, and it does it well. The materials and cushion excel, but the lack of a consistent laced-up fit leads to inconsistent support. If you can lace it up properly, the performance shouldn't be an issue."
9160,192,402,8.4,2021-10-25,user_overall,"My colorway had plastic outsole and performed amazingly in clean courts and it was average in dusty courts. Forefoot double stacked zoom was really bouncy and responsive. If you are a player who plays on his/her toes, this must be your go-to cushioning setup. Support was really nice and fit is pretty good, too. I don't recommend outdoor usage because traction pattern can rip off easily. Materials changes due to colorway, mine's felt high quality on foot and gets the job done, too."
9161,192,531,9.5,2022-01-20,user_overall,"It has good traction on clean surfaces (lateral and linear) and it even got better after breaking it in, unfortunately i have not tested it on dusty surfaces but i think it will be around average in dusty settings. I really had no problems on other things and I also had the XDR/PF version which has more durable rubber. It has no durability problems for me and I also like the double stacked zoom in the forefoot but the heel part was a bit lacking. Overall it was a great shoe for me."
9162,192,483,8.2,2021-11-08,user_overall,"This shoe has a very nice bite on outdoor courts. Unfortunately I didn’t get to try these on an indoor court. However after a while I noticed seeing the traction getting very torn and dirty, materials were very bad. Anyways the cushion was very good, it was a comfy shoe just walking in it. I would recommend this shoe. Because even though the materials were bad, it didn’t really change the performance."

9164,192,533,9.0,2022-05-22,user_overall,Best basketball shoe in my collection until the outsole blew out while training on a dusty af court.
9165,192,293,8.0,2021-01-23,traction,"The traction wasn't terrible, but on hard lateral movements I would slide out a little. The stop was good otherwise."
9166,192,6,7.0,2021-02-03,traction,"Honestly, the traction is pretty inconsistent. Linear movements are really good, but lateral movements suffer a little bit. Overall the traction just isn't that good."
9167,192,45,8.0,2021-09-29,traction,Using a data-informed tread pattern for traction provides plenty of grip when playing.
9168,192,293,9.0,2021-01-23,cushion,"The cushion is one of my favorite parts of the shoe. I didn't think the double stacked Zoom would do anything, but this forefoot unit is insanely bouncy. The heel is okay with some decent compression."
9169,192,6,9.0,2021-02-03,cushion,"The double-stacked Zoom unit in the forefoot feels really really nice. If you like Zoom in the forefoot this definitely has you covered. The court feel isn't amazing, but still good enough."
9170,192,45,9.0,2021-09-29,cushion,The double-stacked Zoom in the forefoot feels bouncy. It provided just what you'd want out of your shoe's cushioning.
9171,192,293,8.0,2021-01-23,materials,"The material quality felt a little cheap in hand but did well performance-wise. The synthetics are thin, soft, and conformed to my foot really well."
9172,192,6,8.0,2021-02-03,materials,"There are a bunch of different materials with mixed quality. Overall, the materials aren't the most premium, but in terms of performance these get the job done just fine."
9173,192,45,9.0,2021-09-29,materials,The materials on the shoe are fantastic for looks and performance.
9174,192,293,9.0,2021-01-23,support,"I had absolutely zero issues with lateral containment. The materials are really supportive, especially along the sidewall. Lateral stability was decent, but the base is not wide and misses an outrigger."
9175,192,6,9.0,2021-02-03,support,I had no issues with the support in this shoe. Lateral stability and containment was nice and I experienced no side to side movement on the footbed.
9176,192,45,7.0,2021-09-29,support,The Why Not Zero.4's support is let down by the fit of the shoe.
9177,192,293,9.0,2021-01-23,fit,"The toe box is nice and snug without a lot of dead space. The materials didn't stretch out a lot so the fit you start with shouldn't change too much. For me, this was a great fit."
9178,192,6,9.0,2021-02-03,fit,"The fit is excellent, and the materials wrap around my foot really well. There is minimal dead space in the toe box which was nice."
9179,192,45,7.0,2021-09-29,fit,The shoe ran a little big for me and the laces loosened throughout my time playing.
9180,192,293,0.0,2021-01-23,outdoor,Durability is really bad.
9181,192,45,50.0,2021-09-29,outdoor,"It performs outdoors, but the rubber is malleable."
9182,192,6,3,2021-02-03,width,I have slightly wide feet and true to size worked for me. Go up half a size if you have really wide feet.
9183,192,6,3,2021-02-03,size,I suggest going true to size.
9184,193,19,8.0,2021-08-21,expert_overall,"The Jordan One Take 2 is a good shoe for the price. The cushion could be a bit lower to the ground, and the materials could be of better quality. But, they perform well enough at the $100 price tag."
9185,193,293,6.8,2021-03-21,expert_overall,"Overall, the Jordan One Take 2 is a downgrade from the previous One Take. If you make a lot of lateral cuts, this isn't the traction for you. The materials feel cheaper than the previous model, and the cushion isn't as good either. It's definitely a disappointing follow-up to the great budget option that the Jordan Westbrook One Take was."

9192,193,293,7.0,2021-03-21,traction,"I slid out on hard lateral movements at times, and overall, the traction is pretty inconsistent."
9193,193,19,8.0,2021-08-21,cushion,The top-loaded forefoot Zoom unit was a pleasure to play in. My only complaint is that the midsole felt a bit too high off the ground.
9194,193,293,7.0,2021-03-21,cushion,"The cushion used is stiff. There isn't much compression to aid with impact protection. The forefoot Zoom unit, which is top-loaded, also doesn't offer much of a bouncy feel."
9195,193,19,8.0,2021-08-21,materials,"Performance-wise, the materials used in the upper work well."
9196,193,293,6.0,2021-03-21,materials,"The mesh material used on the upper of the shoe does not feel good on foot, but it is thin and breathable."
9197,193,19,8.0,2021-08-21,support,The combination and layering of materials provided ample support and lockdown.
9198,193,293,6.0,2021-03-21,support,"Support was my biggest issue with the shoe. The upper is not rigid enough to support your foot as you play, especially as the materials break in over time."
9199,193,19,8.0,2021-08-21,fit,"They run a tad bit long, but I didn't notice as long as I tied the laces up properly."
9200,193,293,8.0,2021-03-21,fit,"The shoe runs a bit long in terms of length. The toe box also becomes roomier over time as the materials stretch. Overall, a solid fit."
9201,193,293,0.0,2021-03-21,outdoor,"Not the most durable shoe, and I wouldn't recommend it for outdoors."
9202,193,293,3,2021-03-21,width,The width seems standard.
9203,193,293,3,2021-03-21,size,True to size should be good. Going down half a size would make the shoe too short length-wise.
9204,194,365,9.1,2021-03-28,expert_overall,"The forefoot cushioning makes this a great shoe for guards, but allows it to be versatile enough for bigs that like to use their quickness. If price isn't an issue, it's a really good shoe."
9205,194,537,9.4,2022-11-30,user_overall,"I recently purchased the XDR (wider last) version of this shoe and I couldn’t be more happier, I went true to size and the fit is awesome! Almost like it was made "
9206,194,538,8.0,2021-11-12,user_overall,"It was actually very good, i felt like they boosted my agility and my bounce looked better. My foot fell asleep after playing for some time because it's so narrow."

9210,194,365,9.5,2021-03-28,traction,The traction on these is almost as good as on the Jordan 34. The only difference is that the traction of the 34s was multidirectional.
9211,194,365,9.0,2021-03-28,cushion,There is a decent-sized forefoot Zoom Air bag that provides an unreal amount of court feel.
9212,194,365,9.0,2021-03-28,materials,"The materials feel like a downgrade from the Jumpman 2020. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how well they worked."
9213,194,365,9.0,2021-03-28,support,"The internal heel counter isn't the best, but it gets the job done."
9214,194,365,9.0,2021-03-28,fit,I sized down half a size because of the wider last in the Performance Fit version of the shoe but wasn't able to test the Standard fit version.
9215,195,32,9.5,2020-12-18,expert_overall,"At $160, you are getting a phenomenal hoop shoe. Pretty much every aspect of the shoe is really good. If I had to describe the Curry 8 in one word it would be fluid."
9216,195,33,9.1,2021-05-26,expert_overall,I absolutely love the Curry 8. The traction is amazing and will work outdoors. It also features great cushioning with the new Flow technology. There are 2 main differences between the 8 and previous Curry shoes. The first is that the upper is much lighter on the 8 and the second is that the 8 gives you both cushioning and court feel.
9217,195,6,9.0,2020-12-20,expert_overall,The Curry 8 is $20 more expensive than the Curry 7 and it's totally worth it! The traction and the cushion are highlights of the shoe. If you pick up a pair of these I don't think you'll be disappointed.
9218,195,293,8.8,2020-12-31,expert_overall,The Curry 8 is awesome. The traction is insane and the cushion is super nice. If you are a guard you will definitely like playing in these!
9219,195,522,8.2,2021-01-13,expert_overall,"The Curry 8 was very close to being great. It was supposed to feel like a running shoe and it definitely did, but to a fault. I loved the traction and the shoe, but it fell short in too many categories to justify $160."
9220,195,497,9.6,2022-03-28,user_overall,"The new brand’s Curry Brand Curry Flow 8 is amazing. It is great for quick guards that need to stop on a dime. The traction is unbelievably great with the new “Flow” technology. The cushion was also very nice with great impact protection. The support was pretty good but it could do better. The materials were very thin and breathable, but that caused the support to be a little lacklustre. The durability was surprisingly good, and outdoor use should be okay. Overall, they are an amazing performer."
9221,195,328,9.4,2022-10-23,user_overall,"Fav shoes I’ve played in. Excellent grip, though weirdly no squeak at all (if that’s an issue for u). Excellent fit, cushioning, stability, court feel. personal preference Iprefer less cushion and more court feel, and I suppose they are slightly more cushiony than court feel. I think they make up for it with how light they are. Despite the light weight, they are highly durable and quality materials. used for 2 years weekly til insoles gave out, which I’ve replaced and still use in my rotation"
9222,195,169,8.7,2023-09-25,user_overall,Love the sock upper but this shoe hurts at true to size i spray “grip spritz” and get really hard stops. But imo curry 9s fit way better and just feel better on foot as it conforms to your foot better looks wise i love this shoe just get prepared to stub ur toe from time to time. As might have to break the shoe in more. (UPDATE FOR FIT) I put a gameday pro insole in the shoe and it fix my heal from moving on stops in the shoe and solved the big toe from hitting the toe box on every stop.
9223,195,541,9.0,2022-04-19,user_overall,"I would definitely recommend this shoe to guards looking for a responsive shoe with top-notch cushioning and traction.  The highlight of this shoe was definitely the cushioning. It felt quick and responsive, with great bounce. The traction is excellent on clean courts, but there was some  slippage on dusty ones. The materials were very breathable and durable, and broke in very quickly. Overall a very good shoe with few disappointments."
9224,195,456,9.5,2022-01-13,user_overall,Wow! The Curry 8 is an absolute banger!!! The traction far outperforms any other model I’ve tried. The new Flow cushion is a joy to play in and gives a nice low-to-the-ground feel for a great responsive experience! The materials consist of a beautiful knit upper with synthetics for support! I have no complaints about this shoe! Well done Curry Brand!
9225,195,32,10.0,2020-12-18,traction,The traction on the Curry 8 is insanely grippy. I could start and stop on a dime in these and there was no slipping.
9226,195,33,9.5,2021-05-26,traction,"The traction is beastly. The only issue I had was when I stepped on the painted lines on outdoor courts, I would sometimes slide."
9227,195,6,10.0,2020-12-20,traction,"The multidirectional traction pattern is freaking nuts! The no-rubber, all-foam sole had me stopping on a dime."
9228,195,293,10.0,2020-12-31,traction,I only got to play outdoors in these and the traction was really nice. I had a super consistent bite that was insane. These stop even better than a rubber outsole.
9229,195,522,10.0,2021-01-13,traction,"This was the best traction I've ever used, it just sticks like crazy. I had no sliding on a semi dusty court it was that great."
9230,195,32,9.0,2020-12-18,cushion,"The cushion feels comparable to Nike React Flyknit but firmer and more responsive. You get an initial spongey feeling, but responsiveness when you step hard. Probably the best cushioning in the Curry lineup."
9231,195,33,9.0,2021-05-26,cushion,"It's a new one-piece cushion called Flow. It feels a lot like a running shoe. It's smooth, comfortable, and provides good heel-to-toe transition. They feel awesome."
9232,195,6,9.0,2020-12-20,cushion,"The Curry 8 features FLOW cushion and overall it's really nice and the best cushion setup in the Curry lineup so far. Nice impact protection in the heel, good bounce, and solid court feel."
9233,195,293,9.0,2020-12-31,cushion,"The FLOW cushion is awesome. The compression is nice and gives you adequate impact protection, but the focus was definitely put on court feel and responsiveness."
9234,195,522,8.0,2021-01-13,cushion,"FLOW cushioning is a pretty good blend of not too hard or too soft. It isn't Zoom or Boost, but it's definitely better than HOVR."
9235,195,32,9.0,2020-12-18,materials,"The materials feel really, really nice. The knit upper is lightweight, flexible, and breathable. The only thing I didn't like is the extra material in the toe box that bunched up when I tied my laces."
9236,195,33,9.0,2021-05-26,materials,The combination of textiles and the knit work well performance-wise. There was also no break-in time.
9237,195,6,9.0,2020-12-20,materials,The materials are pretty nice. The knit upper and synthetic overlay implementation is good and feels nice on-foot. Performance-wise these get the job done just fine.
9238,195,293,9.0,2020-12-31,materials,"The upper material felt nice and conformed well to my feet. These felt like a runner to me, similar to an Ultraboost."
9239,195,522,8.0,2021-01-13,materials,"The knit upper reminds me of Primeknit and feels really nice. The fake plastic leather around the side helped with containment, but patent leather works better."
9240,195,32,9.0,2020-12-18,support,The lockdown is excellent and the support is good thanks to the wide base. The synthetic overlay helped lock in my foot for side to side movements. I did have to tie down the laces pretty tight because of the wide forefoot.
9241,195,33,9.0,2021-05-26,support,The overall support is what you would expect from a Curry shoe. All of the support is coming from the bottom of the shoe since the upper is made of a knit material.
9242,195,6,9.0,2020-12-20,support,"I had no issues with support as I would expect from a Curry shoe. I had no side to side movement on the footbed, heel slippage, or rollover on lateral movements."
9243,195,293,8.0,2020-12-31,support,"I had no issues with lateral containment, but my foot moved around a bit on the footbed. Lateral stability is good even without an outrigger."
9244,195,522,7.0,2021-01-13,support,"The support is nonexistent since these are basically socks with a sole. The outsole is very wide though with a curious design. An outrigger would've helped with stability, but the rand does a decent job with containment."
9245,195,32,8.0,2020-12-18,fit,"The fit is pretty short and wide so I ended up going a size up. After I found the right size, the fit and comfort were good."
9246,195,33,9.0,2021-05-26,fit,They do fit very snugly and really do hug your foot when playing.
9247,195,6,8.0,2020-12-20,fit,Overall the fit is pretty good. There was some dead space in the toe box when I cranked down the laces though.
9248,195,293,8.0,2020-12-31,fit,"Ran a little short for me, but other than that they fit well."
9249,195,522,8.0,2021-01-13,fit,"Out of the box, there was no heel slippage or dead space in the toe box. I think the materials are a little too stretchy though."
9250,195,293,100.0,2020-12-31,outdoor,The durability of the outsole was good which was surprising because there isn't rubber on the outsole.
9251,195,6,3,2020-12-20,width,If you have very wide feet you may want to go up half a size.
9252,195,293,2,2020-12-31,width,Slightly narrow like other Curry models.
9253,195,6,3,2020-12-20,size,True to size works well.
9254,195,293,2,2020-12-31,size,I'd recommend going up half a size.
9255,195,522,1,2021-01-13,size,"I'd recommend going up at least a half size, but maybe a full size."
9256,196,6,8.6,2020-12-18,expert_overall,"Personally, I like the D Rose 11 better than the 10. For $120 I don't think you'll be disappointed with these. Just watch out for the break-in period with the traction."
9257,196,293,8.2,2020-12-18,expert_overall,I'm not a huge fan of the D Rose 11 (or any D Rose since the 7). If you have wide feet and like a roomier fit then you will probably enjoy these more than I did. The cushion and traction are nice though.
9258,196,231,8.2,2023-08-26,user_overall,"I love the lightstrike cushioning on the D Rose 11s and the impact protection it offers is the hest in my collection. The Traction is great on everything except smoother outdoor courts. It's a big shoe, so for me it didn't offer the greatest lateral support. The uppers aren't super flexible and I'm not a fan of the material, but overall the materials on this shoe are very nice and it should hold up outdoors. If you need a wider toe box this is probably a great shoe for you."

9264,196,293,9.0,2020-12-18,traction,This traction pattern looks very similar to the D Rose 7 which had god-tier traction. I only got to try these outdoors and the bite was really good. I also tried them on my wood floors indoors and they seemed good.
9265,196,6,9.0,2020-12-18,cushion,"The partially caged full-length Lightstrike felt really really nice. There is great impact protection in the heel and subtle bounce in the forefoot. I do wish there was a little less caging, but overall the cushion is really good."
9266,196,293,9.0,2020-12-18,cushion,"The full-length Lightstrike cushion feels awesome, especially in the heel. The forefoot is kind of dead, but there is some good bounce in the heel. Overall, impact protection is really nice and the court feel is good too."
9267,196,6,8.0,2020-12-18,materials,"The upper is a sturdy mesh that feels pretty nice with solid support and rigidity. Overall, the material usage is pretty good and gets the job done performance wise."
9268,196,293,7.0,2020-12-18,materials,"The materials are my least favorite part of the shoe. The upper is thin and minimal but didn't feel very nice on foot. Overall, the materials feel flimsy and cheap."
9269,196,6,9.0,2020-12-18,support,"The support of the D Rose 11 is really good. I experienced no heel slippage, side to side movement on the footbed, or lateral instability. I liked that the heel counter came through the midfoot to help contain the foot."
9270,196,293,9.0,2020-12-18,support,I had no issues with lateral containment and lateral stability was insane. The rubber protrudes out a lot in the forefoot for a very wide base. These don't have a lot of ankle support if you need that.
9271,196,6,8.0,2020-12-18,fit,A little wide in the forefoot which was nice for my slightly wide feet. If you have narrow feet you might be swimming in these a bit. Overall fit was okay.
9272,196,293,7.0,2020-12-18,fit,The fit was pretty bad for me. D Rose shoes have never fit well for me. There was some extra space in the toe box and length in the toe. I like my shoes to be snug and narrow and the D Rose 11 wasn't that.
9273,196,293,100.0,2020-12-18,outdoor,The durability was not bad outdoors and held up pretty well.
9274,196,293,4,2020-12-18,width,This is a pretty wide shoe.
9275,196,293,3,2020-12-18,size,I'd suggest going down half a size.
9276,197,365,9.2,2020-12-31,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom Rize 2 is my personal favorite shoe to play in right now. It has all the necessary features to be enjoyed by bigger post players like Marc Gasol or Nikola Jokic while also appealing to faster, downhill-type guards like Russell Westbrook."
9277,197,2,8.7,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"If you like minimal, lightweight, low-cut basketball shoes with a traditional look and lacing system, then the Nike Rize 2 is a great pick."
9278,197,544,8.1,2023-09-02,user_overall,"NIKE ZOOM RIZE 2 Unisex Bringing it back into production again a lot, I like the design and since it's a basketball shoe, it's something that really matches with those of real users."
9279,197,545,9.2,2021-11-15,user_overall,"Absolute bangers! I wish the materials felt nicer, but its the only complaint, and they get the job done and keep the shoe light."

9282,197,365,9.5,2020-12-31,traction,The traction was great for me during testing in both regular solid rubber and XDR rubber versions.
9283,197,2,9.0,2021-05-06,traction,The circular traction pattern uses harder rubber that gives you gnarly traction on clean courts. You won't have any problems on dusty courts either thanks to the well-spaced grooves.
9284,197,365,9.5,2020-12-31,cushion,"The forefoot Zoom feels bouncy and highly effective and the foam is springy and comfortable. Apart from the court feel, you get everything you need from this cushioning!"
9285,197,2,9.0,2021-05-06,cushion,"The full-length injected Phylon feels super plush and the high-PSI Zoom unit in the forefoot is pretty firm when walking but bouncy when you run or jump. Overall, the setup is pretty low-to-the-ground and reponsive."
9286,197,365,9.0,2020-12-31,materials,"The upper materials are minimal, form-fitting, decently supportive, and require almost no break-in period."
9287,197,365,9.0,2020-12-31,support,"The lateral TPU support piece that cages the forefoot Zoom provides a lot of stability, torsional support, and prevented me from rolling on the footbed. This isn't the most supportive shoe of all time but I felt secure at all times."
9288,197,2,8.0,2021-05-06,support,"Heel containment, lockdown, and lateral support are very good."
9289,197,365,9.0,2020-12-31,fit,Half a size down felt more secure as the materials do stretch just a bit over time.
9290,197,2,50.0,2021-05-06,outdoor,Outdoor use is okay.
9291,197,2,3,2021-05-06,size,Go true to size if you have regular wide feet. Wide-footers may want to go half a size up.
9292,198,33,9.3,2021-02-01,expert_overall,I've been calling the Puma Clyde All-Pro the Kobe 9 reincarnate since the first time I played in them. The Kobe 9 was one of the best basketball shoes of all time and the Puma Clyde All-Pro is a better version of it!
9293,198,293,9.2,2021-02-01,expert_overall,The Puma Clyde All-Pro was one of my favorites shoes I've tested this year and it is only $130. Plus I feel like every type of player would enjoy hooping in these. I 100% recommend these.
9294,198,6,9.2,2021-03-10,expert_overall,The Puma Clyde All-Pro is a beastly performer and very well balanced!
9295,198,2,8.6,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"Overall, I really like the All-Pro. The cushion and the upper are very good upgrades from the Hardwood. It's bouncy, responsive, and has plenty of impact protection. It's very stable and provides more than enough support. I'm really impressed with the Puma All-Pro."
9296,198,548,9.0,2022-01-15,user_overall,"Since I always liked to play in low top shoes, these were perfect for me. Personally, I like to have my ankle uncovered and flexable like a soccer/football shoe, as my playingstyle is quick and explosive. Unfortunately, if you play a lot, this one will fall apart quickly, e.g. the glue didn't last long and the upper(of the white ones) quickly discolored in to a sweaty brown and got stiff over time. But Overall, a great shoe, especially the traction(very grippy), fit and cushion."
9297,198,549,9.5,2022-02-19,user_overall,"Amazing shoe. So comfortable and nice to play in because of its cushion, support and fit and also because it is very padded whether it’s in the ankle area or tongue. It laced very well and wraps around your foot well. I don’t recommend these for outdoor use as its rubber is in the softer side and the materials durability isn’t great but don’t worry they are fine for normal use. I highly recommend these as one of the best performing shoes especially for its price"
9298,198,550,9.4,2022-01-11,user_overall,"I love the bite and the cushion inside the shoe around the ankle. It’s a very light shoe and picks up absolutely no dust. Only concern on this shoe is the lock down with the shoe laces, they are held down by very little weak strings but there are methods to fix them once they rip. Other than that,￼￼ this shoe is a great pick for players who love comfort, traction, cushioning, and overall a responsive performance. I highly recommend this hooping shoe."
9299,198,551,8.8,2022-11-05,user_overall,"A nice shoe that should suit most players. The materials conformed to my foot and the cushioning gives a nice balanced ride. However, it is not for the super explosive as the heavy impact protection is just not there. I would say this would be good for a more floor loving player. I did sometimes feel my foot slip over the lateral outrigger on really hard side to side movements but most of the time it held."
9300,198,552,8.8,2021-11-06,user_overall,"Compared to the last model (hardwood) this one improve on cushion specifically, but i think the improvement is a bit too much, I now feel the cushion slows me down a bit one im on drive. I personally feel like the remove of leather upper is a downgrade in material and style. But in terms of overall performance for basketball and fit this one is just as great as the last one and even slightly better."
9301,198,33,10.0,2021-02-01,traction,The traction is Kobe 9 level fantastic! I had no problems from start to finish.
9302,198,293,10.0,2021-02-01,traction,"The checkered pattern outsole provides an incredible bite. The traction was really consistent and I didn't have to worry about them all. I only got to try them outdoors, but they had a nice bite on my wood floors indoors too."
9303,198,6,9.0,2021-03-10,traction,The traction is really really nice! I was able to stop on a dime on clean courts and only needed to wipe here and there on dusty courts.
9304,198,2,9.0,2021-05-06,traction,"The traction held up very well on dusty courts and is a lot stiffer than the Hardwood. On a clean court, it bit really hard too."
9305,198,33,9.0,2021-02-01,cushion,"The ProFoam+ cushion is the best Puma has created thus far. The balance of court feel, cushion, and responsiveness is great and felt comfortable - even playing outdoors."
9306,198,293,8.0,2021-02-01,cushion,"The full-length ProFoam+ feels pretty nice. Once I broke these in, I could feel the cushion when I pushed them hard. The compression and impact protection are decent, but this cushion is definitive on the responsive side."
9307,198,6,10.0,2021-03-10,cushion,This cushion is truly amazing. There is a really good balance of court feel and impact protection. These shoes felt really comfortable on feet and there was some nice bounce in the heel.
9308,198,2,9.0,2021-05-06,cushion,The cushion on the All-Pro is a huge upgrade from the previous Puma basketball models. It is bouncier and it provides a lot of impact protection around the heel because of the Pebax puck in the heel.
9309,198,33,9.0,2021-02-01,materials,The upper is lightweight and a little stiff at first but feels amazing after breaking in. The materials are snug and flexible while also maintaining durability.
9310,198,293,9.0,2021-02-01,materials,"This shoe is literally one of the most minimal shoes I've worn recently. On foot, it feels insane because it's so thin and minimal. Overall, I loved how these felt around my foot."
9311,198,6,9.0,2021-03-10,materials,The upper features an engineered knit which is really nice especially for the price. I have nothing bad to say about these materials and I really liked them.
9312,198,2,9.0,2021-05-06,materials,I was really impressed with the upper even though it's really thin. It was really responsive.
9313,198,33,9.0,2021-02-01,support,"I had no issues with support thanks to a small outrigger, torsion bard, and a solid internal heel counter."
9314,198,293,9.0,2021-02-01,support,I had absolutely no issues with support and lockdown at all. Lateral containment is nice and lateral stability is good from the small outrigger.
9315,198,6,9.0,2021-03-10,support,"The support is also really good - I had no issues. There was no heel slippage or side-to-side movement on the footbed, and I felt locked in laterally."
9316,198,2,8.0,2021-05-06,support,The fibres in the upper do a great job of providing support and lockdown in the upper. I'm very impressed with how the materials work to keep you locked in.
9317,198,33,9.5,2021-02-01,fit,"If you liked the fit of the Kobe 9 then you'll love these. The fit is snug, supportive, and form-fitting."
9318,198,293,10.0,2021-02-01,fit,"The Puma Clyde All-Pro fit my feet like a glove. The toe box area is nice and tight, plus the materials don't stretch out all that much."
9319,198,6,9.0,2021-03-10,fit,Overall the fit was great and I had no dead space in the toe box area. These hugged my foot really nicely.
9320,198,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,"The shoe fit really well for me, but it is a little tight in the forefoot area. It fits similarly to the Kobe 6 in my opinion."
9321,198,293,50.0,2021-02-01,outdoor,The occasional outdoor use should be fine.
9322,198,6,2,2021-03-10,width,If you're a wide footer I'd recommend going up a half size.
9323,198,2,2,2021-05-06,width,It is slightly narrow.
9324,198,293,3,2021-02-01,size,True to size worked for me.
9325,198,6,3,2021-03-10,size,These run true to size.
9326,198,2,3,2021-05-06,size,"If you have a regular or narrow-sized foot, I recommend going true to size. If you have a wide foot, you might want to go up half a size."
9327,199,293,8.8,2022-02-19,expert_overall,The Li-Ning Way of Wade All City 9 is a shoe that's definitely going in my rotation. I love this shoe. It can accommodate every position and playstyle.
9328,199,2,8.3,2022-02-19,expert_overall,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade All City 9 is a solid all-around sneaker. It has traction and cushion, and it's a fast shoe."
9329,199,551,9.2,2022-11-05,user_overall,Personally my favourite shoe. Needs break in time out of the box but once broken in it will stay in your rotation for a while. The traction works on any surface while the cushioning offers a low to the ground feeling with more than enough impact protection while still making you feel quick under foot. Everything except for the materials makes it a perfect shoe for any position looking for a do it all shoe.
9330,199,372,9.2,2022-07-10,user_overall,A very very good shoe for a Pg and basically any position.The only issue is the weight it's heavier than expected but not bulky.Great work from li-ning for making such a top tier performer

9334,199,2,8.0,2022-02-19,traction,"The traction picks up dust, but it still bites on most courts."
9335,199,293,10.0,2022-02-19,cushion,The cushioning setup is my favourite part of the shoe. The Boom foam feels phenomenal and bouncy.
9336,199,2,9.0,2022-02-19,cushion,Li-Ning stepped up and improved the cushioning in the All City 9. The impact protection is plush in the heel and bouncy in the forefoot area.
9337,199,293,8.0,2022-02-19,materials,"The textile materials are thin, and the shoe feels minimal on foot. The shoe also doesn't feel cheap at all."
9338,199,2,8.0,2022-02-19,materials,The upper is mesh mixed with fuse.  The materials and construction make the shoe really durable.
9339,199,293,8.0,2022-02-19,support,The minimal stretch in the upper provides solid support. I also had no issues with lateral containment and stability.
9340,199,2,8.0,2022-02-19,support,The midsole construction helps offer solid heel and ankle support.
9341,199,293,9.0,2022-02-19,fit,"It's really snug in the toe box, and that's just how I like my shoes to fit."
9342,199,293,50.0,2022-02-19,outdoor,The rubber held up decently outdoors.
9343,199,2,100.0,2022-02-19,outdoor,The rubber compound is hard and flexible.
9344,199,2,3,2022-02-19,width,I think wide-footers are pretty safe with this shoe.
9345,199,2,4,2022-02-19,size,Go half a size down if you have a regular foot.
9346,200,32,9.5,2020-11-17,expert_overall,"The Kyrie 7 is the best hoop shoe in his line to date. Performance-wise, these do it all!"
9347,200,293,8.8,2020-12-04,expert_overall,I really like the Kyrie 7. They feel like an upgraded version of the Kyrie 6 with just okay traction. A very good performer overall!
9348,200,6,8.6,2020-11-23,expert_overall,"You are getting a very solid performer for $130. My only gripe with the shoe was the traction on dust, but overall the Kyrie 7 is a great hoop shoe."
9349,200,486,8.0,2021-06-14,expert_overall,"The Kyrie is a very dependable sneaker. There really isn't much that it truly excels at and there are better options. It is one of the most consistent lines Nike has to offer. Overall, the shoe is going to do what you want and need it to do."
9350,200,45,8.0,2021-08-10,expert_overall,"Like previous iterations, the Nike Kyrie 7 is a great performing shoe. Its traction is consistent, the cushion is responsive, and the fit and materials help to provide a good support system."
9351,200,555,9.0,2021-12-01,user_overall,"Traction has a good bite and feels good, but on dusty courts, it definitely pick up dust. As you wipe it, the bite suddenly gets better. Fit is not an issue at all. However the torsional support is almost zero. After a long play, your foot may hurt. This doesn't happened to me but its not an insurance. Materials are dope. Air zoom turbo unit is insane. It give you enough power to speed up and jump. Impact protection is just normal. It is a great shoe for 1-2s and light and fast 3s."
9352,200,309,8.6,2021-11-14,user_overall,"Like all kyries, the 7's are a top performer. The zoom turbo is key for great footwork and pushes you forward with every step. The traction is usually trustworthy, the only problem is dust every now and then. The weight was perfect and allowed faster movement, paired with the traction, the 7's are great for running and takeoff. The uppers did start to rip but it does not change the playability of the shoe. Overall, it's a very efficient shoe for efficient players."
9353,200,446,8.6,2022-06-29,user_overall,"Performance-wise, and specially if you play indoors, the Kyrie 7s are amazing. The traction is absolutely nuts, that’s the aspect I would highlight most about this shoe.  They are lightweight and feel quick and close to the ground, so they are specially good for quick guards. The problem is if you play outdoors, the outsole was destroyed after a few pickup ga"
9354,200,556,9.2,2021-11-26,user_overall,"Love the shoe. My whole basketball career I've worn kyries and out of all of them, the kyrie 7 is the best. It continues to have top-notch traction and support and keeps you feeling swagged out. The only honest downside is it's not as comfortable(cushion) as Kd's. To emphasize, the shoe deserves a 9 and up rating and should be loved by anyone who puts them on! Highly recommend!"
9355,200,53,10.0,2023-04-06,user_overall,"it was great from the second I put it on. Very comfortable, great lockdown, great response & I love the colorways. It's one of Kyries best signature by looks & performance. I would recommend it for more shiftier bball players like guards, but anyone can wear it. The air zoom really helps & the speed I can achieve is great. The shoe is light & I overall love it."
9356,200,32,8.0,2020-11-17,traction,The traction pattern is spread out so it doesn't pick up that much dust. The grip and bite are pretty nice but not as good as in the Kyrie 6.
9357,200,293,8.0,2020-12-04,traction,"The bite was pretty good on clean courts, but they definitely pick up some dust."
9358,200,6,8.0,2020-11-23,traction,"This traction reminded me of tire tread and it performs well, but not as well as the Kyrie 6. I had no issues on clean courts, but I had to wipe on dusty courts."
9359,200,486,9.0,2021-06-14,traction,"We had no complaints about the traction on the Kyrie 7. There were no slip-outs, but we did play on a clean court."
9360,200,45,9.0,2021-08-10,traction,"The traction has deep grooves and blades, but the bite was not as aggressive as previous iterations of the shoe. It still performs very well in all court conditions."
9361,200,32,9.0,2020-11-17,cushion,"The Zoom Turbo Air feels responsive, bouncy, and provides some nice court feel - much like the Kyrie 6."
9362,200,293,9.0,2020-12-04,cushion,"The cushion felt like the Kyrie 5 and 6 with a little better heel cushion. They have surprisingly good impact protection, with nice responsiveness and court feel."
9363,200,6,9.0,2020-11-23,cushion,"Basically the same cushion setup as the Kyrie 6. The Zoom Air is more subtle, but it still feels really good."
9364,200,486,7.0,2021-06-14,cushion,We didn't feel the Zoom in the shoe compared to models such as the KDs.
9365,200,45,8.0,2021-08-10,cushion,"For the third year in a row, there is a Zoom Turbo in the forefoot. It provides a great court feel and is very responsive, but it does lack impact protection."
9366,200,32,8.0,2020-11-17,materials,"Just like previous Kyrie models, the mesh is soft and flexible right out of the box with no break in required. The materials are not the most premium, but they performed well on the court."
9367,200,293,9.0,2020-12-04,materials,I really like how these materials feel on foot. They are very thin and minimal which I love. I also enjoy not having a strap on the forefoot.
9368,200,6,8.0,2020-11-23,materials,"The full mesh upper was crispy and a little stiff, but they felt nice on foot. Performance-wise these got the job done great."
9369,200,486,8.0,2021-06-14,materials,Material choice is nice.
9370,200,45,8.0,2021-08-10,materials,"The mesh material gets the job done, but it feels basic. It does feel lightweight and breathable."
9371,200,32,9.0,2020-11-17,support,The forefoot strap from the Kyrie 6 was replaced by TPU fins which work pretty much the same. The lockdown is excellent and the wide base provides great support.
9372,200,293,9.0,2020-12-04,support,"I had no issues at all with the support. Lateral containment and stability was good, plus these have some decent ankle support."
9373,200,6,9.0,2020-11-23,support,The Kyrie 7 is no different than previous models when it comes to support. I had no side to side movement on the footbed or lateral instabilities. These definitely had me covered for support.
9374,200,486,8.0,2021-06-14,support,I like that the Kyrie's are mids. They help me mentally feel more secure in the heel area.
9375,200,45,8.0,2021-08-10,support,The moulded fins on both sides of the shoe help to keep you locked in. There's also a wide base on the shoe to help the shoe feel stable.
9376,200,32,9.0,2020-11-17,fit,The fit is similar to previous Kyrie models and comes snug out of the box. The Kyrie 7 is much more minimal than the Kyrie 6 and felt very light on feet.
9377,200,293,9.0,2020-12-04,fit,"These fit pretty much like the Kyrie 6. They are very snug in the forefoot which I really like. Overall, the fit is very good."
9378,200,6,9.0,2020-11-23,fit,They fit pretty snug like every other Kyrie model. I liked how they wrap around my foot really well providing an almost 1-to-1 fit.
9379,200,486,8.0,2021-06-14,fit,Forms to your foot nicely.
9380,200,45,7.0,2021-08-10,fit,It's a narrow-fitting shoe that needs some break-in time before starting to feel nice.
9381,200,293,0.0,2020-12-04,outdoor,The outsole is not durable enough for outdoor use.
9382,200,45,50.0,2021-08-10,outdoor,I think they'll be ok outdoors.
9383,200,6,2,2020-11-23,width,I am a wide footer I recommend going up half a size.
9384,200,45,2,2021-08-10,width,The shoe is narrow like most other Kyrie models.
9385,200,293,3,2020-12-04,size,True to size was great for me. If you don't like a snug fit I'd recommend going up half a size.
9386,200,6,3,2020-11-23,size,True to size should work fine.
9387,200,486,3,2021-06-14,size,The fit runs true to size.
9388,200,45,2,2021-08-10,size,The shoe fits snug until broken in.
9389,201,293,8.8,2020-11-23,expert_overall,The Lebron Witness 5 is a really nice shoe to play in even for a budget shoe at $100. I would definitely recommend these.
9390,201,6,8.6,2020-11-17,expert_overall,"For $100, the Lebron Witness 5 is a pretty solid shoe - I would definitely recommend them!"
9391,201,181,8.1,2024-03-05,user_overall,"I used this shoe for indoors and outdoors, I think it’s a great shoe overall but considering it got old slightly faster than my other shoes and gives me blisters occasionally brought the rating down slightly. I’d recommend this for players who are more athletic or attack the basket more often; there are better options for those who are quicker/shiftier."
9392,201,557,7.0,2023-04-13,user_overall,"The shoes don't hold well around the ankle and the tongue can hurt you. After a 7 months (one play per week), the sole starts to crack at the air zoom unit. Ventilate is pretty good but traction is quite average. The previous model was better. I do not recommend these shoes."
9393,201,414,9.0,2022-11-20,user_overall,Absolute dust magnet but very durable for indoors and not durable for outdoors. Despite being heavy they feel light and are overall great for any shot. Traction is really good expect when its dusty in which case it sucks.
9394,201,433,8.6,2023-05-16,user_overall,"Pros: comfy, comforts your feet very well, above average traction, good qualit"
9395,201,258,7.9,2023-10-28,user_overall,Ok shoe. Biggest downsights are traction and materials that feel cheap. It is a budget friendly shoe and for this price it is not bad but there are better performers out there.
9396,201,293,9.0,2020-11-23,traction,They offer a really good and consistent bite on an outdoor court. I didn't get to try them indoors.
9397,201,6,8.0,2020-11-17,traction,"Reuses the traction pattern from the Lebron Witness 4 which was pretty good. They offer nice bite on clean courts, but I had to consistently wipe on dusty courts to maintain traction."
9398,201,293,8.0,2020-11-23,cushion,The full-length Phylon cushion doesn't feel that bad. The heel compression is decent and the forefoot Zoom units are okay. The court feel is adequate and feels similar to the PG4.
9399,201,6,8.0,2020-11-17,cushion,"The Lebron Witness 5 has decent impact protection, even in the heel unlike the Witness 4. The forefoot Zoom pods are subtle, and I could really only feel them when I was putting a lot of force on the shoe."
9400,201,293,9.0,2020-11-23,materials,"I really liked the materials used here! They are very thin, comfortable, and cozy on foot. For $100, they did the materials really well."
9401,201,6,9.0,2020-11-17,materials,The materials are revamped from the Witness 4 and are really nice especially for the price.
9402,201,293,9.0,2020-11-23,support,The support and lockdown felt really good to me on these. The materials held my foot on the footbed well and the lateral stability was pretty good.
9403,201,6,9.0,2020-11-17,support,I had no issues with the support in this shoe. I had no heel slippage and the lateral support and stability were nice. The materials also kept my foot on the footbed well.
9404,201,293,9.0,2020-11-23,fit,I really enjoyed the snug fit. The shoe hugged my foot well and was easy to put on.
9405,201,6,9.0,2020-11-17,fit,The half booty upper fit really well for me.
9406,201,293,0.0,2020-11-23,outdoor,The durability of the outsole is terrible.
9407,201,6,2,2020-11-17,width,If you have wide feet these may be a little hard to put on and snug in the midfoot.
9408,201,6,3,2020-11-17,size,True to size.
9409,202,365,9.1,2021-02-01,expert_overall,I'd recommend the Kawhi 1 to everyone who is okay with a little bit of break-in time. They will be good for any playing style and especially cater to bigger athletes looking for more support.
9410,202,293,8.4,2020-11-25,expert_overall,"I didn't like playing in the Kawhi, especially for $160. If you need a rigid and supportive shoe then these are for you, but if not I'd stay away from these."
9411,202,6,8.2,2020-11-19,expert_overall,"The Kawhi retails for $160 and is a great performer. For the price I expected a little more, but overall these are nice."
9412,202,2,8.2,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"The New Balance Kawhi 1 is a good first entry in Kawhi's signature line. It's a supportive and secure shoe with a decent cushion that provides impact protection. The traction also grips nicely, and the compound appears to be durable."
9413,202,294,8.5,2023-10-13,user_overall,"A very good option for players on outdoor courts and indoor positions, the materials are of good quality at the cost of the weight of the shoes being considerably greater than other pairs, the cushioning responds decently for any position and the traction despite being translucent It holds the grip quite well after many outdoor games. The best point of this shoe is the support that, together with the Trae Young 1, is the best support I have ever had. After many games the shoe is a little narrow"
9414,202,320,8.2,2022-04-18,user_overall,"The KAWHI 1 is a decent shoe. It has a nice outsole, with thick grooves. However, the foam is thick, but very stiff like the materials. Is better once broken in, but takes some time. Good for about $100. Nothing really stands out besides durability and lateral containment, which is pretty good. I would suggest this shoe for bigger guys who need good stability with decent cushion and ok traction."
9415,202,558,8.8,2022-11-26,user_overall,"Overall good shoe, the only nitpick I had was the performance of the traction on dusty courts. On clean courts it is really good."
9416,202,559,8.8,2021-12-30,user_overall,"The Kawhi 1 is really good. But i don't like the heel, it is a bit hard."
9417,202,515,8.3,2022-08-18,user_overall,
9418,202,365,9.0,2021-02-01,traction,"The data-driven outsole performs well. Dust was heavily attracted to the translucent part of the outsole, but the more aggressive traction under the ball of the foot gets rid of dust well."
9419,202,293,9.0,2020-11-25,traction,"The traction pattern on the Kawhi reminded me of a brain. The bite is great indoors and outdoors, but they pick up some dust so I had to consistently wipe."
9420,202,6,8.0,2020-11-19,traction,"This traction pattern reminded me of a maze. I had no problems with grip on clean courts, but I did have to wipe on dusty courts to maintain a good bite."
9421,202,2,8.0,2021-05-06,traction,"The compound is hard, and the grooves are thick. The traction is on point."
9422,202,365,9.0,2021-02-01,cushion,"The FuelCell foam used in the midsole is thicker than the OMN1S and the ride isn't as smooth because of it. Court feel isn't as good, but there is ample impact protection indoors. Not my favorite cushioning, but much better than others."
9423,202,293,8.0,2020-11-25,cushion,"This cushion setup is very responsive and offers a lot of court feel. Impact protection is good too, but I wish the heel cushion wasn't caged. Overall, this cushion setup is nice."
9424,202,6,9.0,2020-11-19,cushion,"The FuelCell midsole felt bouncier than the OMN1S in the forefoot. The heel is a little firmer because of the caging. Overall, I really liked the cushion setup."
9425,202,2,8.0,2021-05-06,cushion,The Fuelcell cushion is thicker than on the Omn1s and does a good job of providing impact protection. It has a bit of bounce but not too much.
9426,202,365,9.0,2021-02-01,materials,The material construction is even more elaborate than it appears at first - which is a good thing. The one-piece bootie is not as stretchy as you may expect but they broke in and aged nicely.
9427,202,293,7.0,2020-11-25,materials,"These materials aren't my favorite. On foot, they didn't feel terrible, but they were stiff even after breaking in. There is a piece on the heel that dug into the back of my foot which was uncomfortable."
9428,202,6,7.0,2020-11-19,materials,The materials used in the Kawhi 1 are alright. The upper is made mostly from hard textile and fuse which is a bit disappointing considering the premium price. Performance-wise these got the job done just fine.
9429,202,2,8.0,2021-05-06,materials,The embroidery and leather on the colourway I had felt premium and durable.
9430,202,365,9.5,2021-02-01,support,"The support is the best attribute of the shoe which makes sense considering these are designed for Kawhi. They almost felt too supportive at first, but they broke in nicely and are one of the most secure pair in my rotation."
9431,202,293,10.0,2020-11-25,support,Support is what this shoe does best! I had no issues at all and this is a shoe Zion Williamson could play in.
9432,202,6,9.0,2020-11-19,support,I didn't have any support issues with the Kawhi. They offer great lateral containment and stability. The heel counter and shank plate kept me locked in.
9433,202,2,9.0,2021-05-06,support,"The ankle support and heel containment are excellent with the thick heel counter. The combination of fuse, mesh and leather around the upper also does a good job of keeping your foot secure."
9434,202,365,9.0,2021-02-01,fit,The fit is very snug and it was a little hard to get my foot in the shoe at first. As these break in this becomes easier and the fit improves.
9435,202,293,8.0,2020-11-25,fit,The fit is pretty snug and the materials don't stretch out at all. They fit well with a little dead space in the toe box.
9436,202,6,8.0,2020-11-19,fit,"These fit pretty well. There was a little dead space in the toe box and they felt slightly bulky. Other than that, everything was fine."
9437,202,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,"The shoe fits well, but it is kind of snug around the midfoot."
9438,202,293,100.0,2020-11-25,outdoor,The durability of the outsole is really good.
9439,202,293,2,2020-11-25,width,
9440,202,6,3,2020-11-19,width,I am a slightly wide footer and had no issues.
9441,202,2,3,2021-05-06,width,The midfoot area is a bit snug.
9442,202,293,3,2020-11-25,size,I went true to size and it was good for me.
9443,202,6,4,2020-11-19,size,I'd recommend going down half a size from your normal shoe size.
9444,202,2,3,2021-05-06,size,"If you have a regular foot, go true to size, and if you have a wide foot, you might want to go half a size up."
9445,203,6,7.8,2020-11-19,expert_overall,"Personally, I wouldn't play in the Kyrie Flytrap 4 because of the stiff cushion, but if you want a pair of shoes to beat up these aren't bad for $90."
9446,203,293,7.6,2020-11-19,expert_overall,I'd recommend not getting the Kyrie Flytrap 4. I'd suggest the Flytrap 3 instead just because of the traction and cushion.
9447,203,560,6.0,2023-12-22,user_overall,"Coming from the Kyrie 4, these shoes didn’t work for me. They were slightly big and the materials used were (rightfully) cheap. The laces kept stretching as I would tighten them. Also, why did Nike decide to wrap this shoe in a cheap plastic tarp? I feel bad for missing the return window on these. They ran larger than I expected and their supporting looks are extremely deceiving. These shoes lack the characteristic ankle stability of the main Kyrie line."
9448,203,561,7.8,2022-04-07,user_overall,This shoe is great for a cheap price and its especially good for shooting and point guards but it easily gets damaged after a while. The traction materials on the bottom became mushed from the quick turns and stops. This shoe also gets easily dirty if you use it outdoors. This shoe is mostly for indoors.
9449,203,504,6.6,2022-01-05,user_overall,"The shoe was ok, the traction made me do the splits indoor till its break in period was over. Also the materials are bad but decent for the price."
9450,203,414,9.5,2023-02-22,user_overall,I got these for 24 dollars at a Nike store and they have incredible performance for that price surprisingly good tractions and feel insanely light
9451,203,562,9.1,2022-08-21,user_overall,I had this shoe for 1 whole year and this shoe is clear as a whistle. I like this shoe and recommend it. One of the best cheap shoes out there.
9452,203,6,8.0,2020-11-19,traction,"The modified herringbone traction is pretty good. I didn't have any problems on clean courts, but I did have to consistently wipe on dusty courts."
9453,203,293,6.0,2020-11-19,traction,The traction was terrible on a dusty indoor court. They didn't have a good bite even with a lot of wiping or on clean areas of the court.
9454,203,6,7.0,2020-11-19,cushion,"This full-length Phylon midsole is pretty stiff but very responsive. If you want a lot of impact protection these aren't for you. The forefoot Zoom unit isn't that pronounced, but it has a subtle bounce. This is a really responsive cushion setup."
9455,203,293,7.0,2020-11-19,cushion,"This cushion setup is okay. It's low to the ground and responsive, but there is not a lot of impact protection. The Zoom unit is kind of bouncy and the only thing going for the cushioning."
9456,203,6,7.0,2020-11-19,materials,"The cheap mesh doesn't feel great to the touch, but performance-wise they get the job done."
9457,203,293,8.0,2020-11-19,materials,"The thin, cheap textile upper felt great on foot. It is minimal, supportive, and gets the job done well performance-wise."
9458,203,6,9.0,2020-11-19,support,The support is the best aspect of the shoe. I had no heel slippage or side to side movement on the footbed. I had no issues with lateral stability either.
9459,203,293,9.0,2020-11-19,support,The support is really good. I've never had any issues with lateral support in any Kyrie shoe and these are the same. Lateral stability is also good even with outsole curvature.
9460,203,6,8.0,2020-11-19,fit,The fit is similar to other Kyrie models and conforms to your feet pretty nicely.
9461,203,293,8.0,2020-11-19,fit,These fit similarly to the other Kyrie Flytrap models and wrap around your foot well. They were easy to put on and you can get good lockdown with the laces.
9462,203,6,50.0,2020-11-19,outdoor,"I think these would do well outdoors, but durability won't be the best because of the soft rubber."
9463,203,293,0.0,2020-11-19,outdoor,"The traction outdoors was also terrible, but the outsole seemed pretty durable."
9464,203,293,2,2020-11-19,width,"If you have a wide foot, I'd suggest going up half or a whole size."
9465,203,293,3,2020-11-19,size,True to size fit me well.
9466,204,293,8.8,2020-11-02,expert_overall,"This is my favorite LeBron to play in! The only drawbacks are the weight, lateral stability, and court feel. Everything else performed well and I enjoyed playing in it. I'd 100% recommend these."
9467,204,33,8.8,2020-12-18,expert_overall,The Lebron 18 is a bad boy with an amazing cushion and solid traction. The lateral instability was the only thing holding them back from being an all-out beast.
9468,204,45,8.2,2021-05-31,expert_overall,"The LeBron 18 provides plenty of cushioning but is a heavy shoe because of it. Despite this, it's a good shoe that can fit a variety of play styles if you can handle the support and lack of court feel."
9469,204,32,8.0,2020-10-09,expert_overall,The LeBron 18 is definitely a big boy shoe. The cushion is by far the best aspect of the shoe and the traction is solid too. The digging of the tongue into my foot and lateral stability were issues though.
9470,204,6,8.0,2020-10-24,expert_overall,"Overall for $200 I wouldn't recommend the LeBron 18. The tongue was pretty uncomfortable, the traction wasn't great, and the lateral containment was an issue. Pick these up if you want a crazy cushion setup."
9471,204,486,7.6,2021-06-14,expert_overall,"I would not recommend this shoe to just about anyone. I'd only say get these if you need the extra cushion underfoot and are in dire need of impact protection. It really depends on your play style. Based on my personal preference, however, I didn't like the lack of court feel and responsiveness of the LeBron."
9472,204,358,9.8,2021-12-31,user_overall,"These shoes are amazing for large athletes who suffer from joint/leg pains after playing. My brother and I had patella tendonitis before using these, but the beefy cushion protected our joints so well that it went away for us both! These shoes aren't a magic cure, but their supportive and cushioned qualities certainly make it a joy to play in. Nice bounce too! Laterally, you are not so supported, so watch out someone may take your ankles. Overall however not a big deal these shoes still bang!"
9473,204,563,9.0,2023-04-16,user_overall,"It is not vey breathable due to lots of cushioning and great material use, this also makes them extremely heavy but after 5 or so sessions, you become use to the weight. I find that the traction is amazing unless lots of dust gathers, i would usually wipe my shoes once every session or so because of this. They are extremely durable however due to the high heel position, you feel a bit more unstable and prone to ankle rolls. However, the shoe is extremely comfortable and has great heel to toe"
9474,204,429,8.9,2022-01-10,user_overall,"Super fun shoe to play in. Everything is amazing with the exception of the support. Traction is good, materials are great on foot, and the fit is great. The cushion is out of this world with a 3 layer setup. you really feel everything under your feet. There is not that much court feel but that doesn’t really matter to me. support is the only thing I have a problem with. Rolled my ankle a few times in this, but overall amazing shoe"
9475,204,149,8.1,2025-01-25,user_overall,This shoe is extremely heavy but it is worth it. The traction is elite and the cushioning is spot on. The durability can be a downside as my shoe lasted for only 8 months until the materials broke. But this shoe is top tier elite. As it is a high top shoe I would recommend this shoe for big forwards and centres as Lebron shoes are known for big shoes.
9476,204,564,9.2,2021-11-16,user_overall,"Great basketball shoe! Cushion is just superb, traction is decent on clean courts, lateral stability is quite an issue but if you are a lighter guy it doesn't really matter. The only downfall of this shoe is the tongue and its weight."
9477,204,293,8.0,2020-11-02,traction,"Playing on an outdoor court, the traction was a little inconsistent. For the most part, I had a nice bite, but on some hard movements I slid out a bit."
9478,204,33,9.0,2020-12-18,traction,The traction on the Lebron 18 is very consistent indoors. It worked wonders and the rubber always maintained contact with the floor.
9479,204,45,8.0,2021-05-31,traction,The traction does the trick. It has very good coverage and really bites on clean courts. The forefoot does collect dust on dirtier courts and wiping is needed.
9480,204,32,9.0,2020-10-09,traction,The traction performed above average and worked well most of the time. The only issue I had was some parts of the outsole picked up a lot of dust and caused a bit of slipping.
9481,204,6,8.0,2020-10-24,traction,"The traction on the LeBron 18 is okay. On clean courts I didn't have any problems, but on dusty courts you might run into some issues."
9482,204,486,8.0,2021-06-14,traction,The traction holds up well. The pattern worked for me.
9483,204,293,10.0,2020-11-02,cushion,The cushion setup is awesome! It's one of my favorite setups that I've tested recently. The combo of Air Max and full-length Zoom Air is insanely comfortably but lacks a little bit of court feel.
9484,204,33,10.0,2020-12-18,cushion,"This cushion setup features three layers of cushioning: a Cushlon midsole, a rear Air Max unit, and a full-length Zoom Strobel. Impact protection is great, but there is a bit of lag as the cushioning is super soft."
9485,204,45,9.0,2021-05-31,cushion,"The full-length Zoom unit, Air Max heel, and Cushlon cushioning provide great energy return and impact protection. However, the setup provides no court feel."
9486,204,32,10.0,2020-10-09,cushion,"Full-length Zoom Air, Cushlon, and Max Air really make for a nice combination of impact protection and responsiveness. Overall, the cushioning is bonkers!"
9487,204,6,10.0,2020-10-24,cushion,"The cushion is insane and definitely the best aspect of the shoe. This is the craziest cushion setup I have tested to this day. It is very bouncy and comfortable. You do lose some court feel, but I like it better than the LeBron 17!"
9488,204,486,8.0,2021-06-14,cushion,"The LeBron 18 provides plenty of cushioning and they feel like you're walking on clouds. The downside is that because of the cushion, the shoe is very heavy."
9489,204,293,9.0,2020-11-02,materials,The knit material is very nice and a bit thinner compared to previous LeBron models. It felt awesome on foot. I wasn't a big fan of the tongue though.
9490,204,33,9.0,2020-12-18,materials,The Knitposite 2.0 upper is nice and thick with a rubbery feel. The material doesn't stretch much and there is no break-in time.
9491,204,45,9.0,2021-05-31,materials,Knitposite 2.0 is breathable and lightweight. It provides everything you'd need from materials but does feel too soft and stretchy.
9492,204,32,7.0,2020-10-09,materials,"The Battleknit is extremely strong and durable, but kind of suffocating. The Air Max in the tongue of the shoe is crazy, but I wasn't a big fan as it dug into the top of my foot and felt terrible."
9493,204,6,8.0,2020-10-24,materials,"The Battleknit upper feels very premium and has decent breathability. I had an issue with the tongue digging into my foot and it was not the most comfortable. Air Max in the tongue looks cool, but it's a gimmick and didn't do anything for me."
9494,204,486,8.0,2021-06-14,materials,The Knitposite 2.0 feels nice but isn't quite as soft as other knit materials.
9495,204,293,8.0,2020-11-02,support,"Lateral containment is good and the knit material didn't stretch out that much for me. Lateral stability was decent, but sometimes I felt like I might roll my ankle when the Air Max compressed. The base could be a little wider to provide more stability."
9496,204,33,7.0,2020-12-18,support,Support in the heel and lateral containment are great. Lateral stability could be better and there was some rollover because of the lack of an outrigger.
9497,204,45,7.0,2021-05-31,support,The heel counter and lacing system helps to keep your ankle locked in. The materials don't provide much lateral support and I felt myself falling off of the footbed.
9498,204,32,7.0,2020-10-09,support,"The lacing system is solid and it helped lock down my feet with good lateral containment. The stability is okay, but I did feel wobbly at times. Bigger hoopers shouldn't have issues with this."
9499,204,6,6.0,2020-10-24,support,"I think the support is the worst thing about the shoe. I had no heel slippage, but lateral containment was lacking. My feet would slide off the footbed on hard moves. They didn't give me the confidence I wanted when I was playing. Everything else was fine."
9500,204,486,7.0,2021-06-14,support,"Because of the fit, my foot was sliding along the footbed quite a bit."
9501,204,293,9.0,2020-11-02,fit,The Lebron 18 fits nice and snug in the toe box area and feels great through the rest of the mid foot.
9502,204,33,9.0,2020-12-18,fit,"The lockdown is solid linearly, but not great laterally. The shoe tips a bit on hard stops and quick starts which can be improved by tightening the laces, but the cheap plastic tongue dug into the top of my foot when I did that."
9503,204,45,8.0,2021-05-31,fit,"Initially, the shoe fits great and really hugs your foot, but the stretchy materials can loosen up the fit as you play."
9504,204,32,8.0,2020-10-09,fit,"They were a little snug initially, but after breaking them in they fit well. The shoe is extremely comfortable from the bottom down, but the upper was just okay."
9505,204,6,8.0,2020-10-24,fit,"I thought these felt nice on my foot, but the tongue area felt a little bulky. The heel is sculpted well and the fit is good overall."
9506,204,486,7.0,2021-06-14,fit,The fit was not there for me. It was not snug at all.
9507,204,293,0.0,2020-11-02,outdoor,The durability on the outsole isn't great and I wouldn't play in these outdoors.
9508,204,486,0.0,2021-06-14,outdoor,I wouldn't think about taking these outdoors. The rubber is very soft.
9509,204,45,4,2021-05-31,width,LeBron's are known for fitting a tiny bit on the wider side.
9510,204,6,3,2020-10-24,width,I have slightly wide feet and had no issues.
9511,204,45,3,2021-05-31,size,"They can accommodate a bit of a wider foot, but sticking to true to size should work."
9512,204,6,3,2020-10-24,size,I would say these run true to size.
9513,205,293,9.4,2020-10-19,expert_overall,"The Jordan 35 comes in at $180 which is definitely expensive, but if you want a great performer these are it. This shoe excels in all areas and I think everyone can play in it."
9514,205,33,9.1,2020-10-17,expert_overall,"The Jordan 35 is an updated version of the 34 and excels in almost every category. Unfortunately, the fit issue with the nylon cables ruined my ability to be comfortable in the shoe."
9515,205,32,9.0,2020-10-25,expert_overall,"Overall, the Jordan 35 performs really well. It has better cushion and materials than the 34, but I didn't like the eclipse plate as much because it was uncomfortable at times."
9516,205,6,9.0,2020-11-01,expert_overall,"The Jordan 35 retails for $180 which is pretty steep, but this is a really nice shoe that performs well. Everything about the shoe is amazing besides the traction on dust. Overall, it was extremely fun to play in the AJ XXXV."
9517,205,2,8.3,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"The strong points for the sneaker are that the forefoot Zoom unit keeps you close to the ground while staying bouncy, and the upper materials are comfortable and do a good job of keeping you contained. That being said, there are some inconsistencies with the traction, and the insole takes a little bit of breaking in. Overall, the Jordan 35 is an improvement from the 34."
9518,205,552,10.0,2021-11-06,user_overall,"I personally feel like this shoe is an all around upgrade from 34, the only thing that i see 34 beats this one is breathability and weights, which is something you cant avoid by implementing leather (which makes it feel more premium). The only problem I see people complaining about is the flight plate is a bit narrow for arch, but this can be fixed by swapping insoles."
9519,205,76,9.2,2023-05-01,user_overall,"these are the jordan 35 low fyi, luka coulorway. favourite hoop shoe at the moment, cushion is insane!! traction heavily underated in the luka low coulorway once broken in just as good at the "
9520,205,551,9.3,2022-11-05,user_overall,"Mental shoe, nearly every aspect works perfectly except for the break in time. I spent nearly 30 hours in these shoes of hard play before I was happy with the comfort levels to take them everywhere. Even now after a while of not playing in them my feet will hurt for a bit before they settle back down."
9521,205,565,9.7,2023-02-27,user_overall,I thought it has bouncy cushion but it has good traction and great material great fit not for outdoor because outsole is not hard rubber and my honest opinion on this sneaker is amazing just amazing
9522,205,71,7.0,2022-03-19,user_overall,Didn’t feel great from the very beginning and became worse with time. Eventually ended up feeling very unbalanced while running in them and decided not to use them anymore for playing ball.
9523,205,293,9.0,2020-10-19,traction,"The herringbone traction worked really well outdoors and consistently had a great bite. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try them indoors."
9524,205,33,9.5,2020-10-17,traction,The traction pattern is pretty much the same as the Jordan 34 and it performs beastly. It is ultra-reliable and good to go at all times.
9525,205,32,9.0,2020-10-25,traction,"Just like in the Jordan 34, the traction works really well! The tight traction pattern picked up some dust, so I had to wipe occasionally. When the floor was clean the traction was pretty nice."
9526,205,6,9.0,2020-11-01,traction,"On clean courts, I was able to stop on a dime, but on dust, I had a few issues and needed to wipe."
9527,205,2,7.0,2021-05-06,traction,"The traction was not as consistent as I would've liked. On some dustier courts, I experienced slipping. It also doesn't bite as hard as some other shoes on the market right now."
9528,205,293,10.0,2020-10-19,cushion,I love this cushion setup. Jordan used the same cushioning in the forefoot as in the 34 and added a new large volume Zoom Air unit in the heel. My feet never hurt - even playing outdoors. The court feel was also pretty nice too!
9529,205,33,10.0,2020-10-17,cushion,"Jordan brought back the unlocked Zoom Air with a slightly different setup from the 34s. The forefoot is pretty much the same, but the heel is much improved with a large Zoom Air unit. Big players and those that play on their heels should like these a bit more."
9530,205,32,10.0,2020-10-25,cushion,"They pumped up the Zoom Air in the 35! These are just as bouncy as the 34, if not more, and the improvement in the heel cushioning is noticeable. This is one of the best cushion setups by far."
9531,205,6,10.0,2020-11-01,cushion,"The Zoom units feel really nice. The forefoot is bouncy and responsive, and the heel feels really nice as well. This is a great implementation of Zoom Air - I have no complaints!"
9532,205,2,9.0,2021-05-06,cushion,The Zoom units in the 35 felt great and they provided a lot of impact protection in the heel.
9533,205,293,8.0,2020-10-19,materials,The blend of old school materials and curing materials is really nice. I did have some uncomfortable rubbing on my Achilles near the ankle area.
9534,205,33,9.0,2020-10-17,materials,The materials are a bit of an upgrade from the Jordan 34. They are a nice mix of premium overlay materials and lightweight textiles that offer a ton of ventilation with no break-in time.
9535,205,32,9.0,2020-10-25,materials,"The materials feel more premium and gave me more support compared with the Air Jordan 34, but with that came a little more bulk. Performance-wise they are really good."
9536,205,6,9.0,2020-11-01,materials,The mixture of new and old school materials is really nice and a clear upgrade over the 34.
9537,205,2,9.0,2021-05-06,materials,The material on the upper is a big upgrade from the Jordan 34s. I like that they didn't go with lots of textiles and meshes but instead used more premium-feeling materials. It also feels much more comfortable than the 34s.
9538,205,293,10.0,2020-10-19,support,I had absolutely zero issues with support in this shoe. The eclipse plate and the Flywire are super supportive so the lateral containment and stability are great.
9539,205,33,10.0,2020-10-17,support,The support is noticeably better than in the Jordan 34 because of a beefier build and better upper materials. The ankle collar also didn't buckle like it did in the 34.
9540,205,32,8.0,2020-10-25,support,"The updated eclipse plate definitely provided more support than the 34, but pressed up onto my foot a little too much making it uncomfortable. The ankle collar was a little too bulky for me and felt suffocating."
9541,205,6,9.0,2020-11-01,support,"The support was really, really great! I had no heel slippage or issues with lateral stability or containment. I always felt locked in securely."
9542,205,2,8.0,2021-05-06,support,The materials do a good job of containing your foot on lateral cuts. The newly implemented lacing system and the extra heel padding really lock your foot into the shoe.
9543,205,293,10.0,2020-10-19,fit,These fit me like a glove and were nice and snug in the toe box. I felt locked in and the shoe was also really easy to put on. The fit was awesome!
9544,205,33,7.0,2020-10-17,fit,"I had a fit issue where the nylon lace cables rubbed the side of my feet raw. It was pretty painful and I couldn't really fix it with the laces. Other than that, the shoe fit very well and had great lockdown."
9545,205,32,9.0,2020-10-25,fit,"There was a little dead space in the forefoot, but not enough to change sizes. Overall the shoe was really comfortable, but I wasn't a fan of the ankle collar."
9546,205,6,8.0,2020-11-01,fit,"I could feel the eclipse plate rubbing on my foot sometimes and it wasn't very comfortable. Outside of this, the fit was really nice and the materials wrapped around my foot well."
9547,205,293,0.0,2020-10-19,outdoor,These wore out very quickly outdoors.
9548,205,2,0.0,2021-05-06,outdoor,The rubber is too soft for use outdoors.
9549,205,6,2,2020-11-01,width,I could see some wide footers having issues. Maybe go up half a size if you have wide feet.
9550,205,6,3,2020-11-01,size,True to size was okay for me.
9551,206,6,8.8,2020-10-21,expert_overall,For $110 the Dame 7 is definitely a recommended pickup. I don't think you'll be disappointed!
9552,206,293,8.6,2020-10-31,expert_overall,I really enjoyed playing in these! Everything performed well and I think every position player can play in these.
9553,206,497,8.9,2022-03-28,user_overall,"The adidas Dame 7 is a pretty good shoe for most guards. The traction started off inconsistent, but got a lot better over time. The cushion was good and had impact protection. It also has nice bounce but it bottoms out pretty quickly. The support was pretty good and it kept your foot in place. The materials weren’t the best but it still wasn’t bad. The durability was amazing, and this shoe is great for outdoors and it will hold up very well. Overall it is nice but it takes some time to break in."
9554,206,483,9.0,2022-01-08,user_overall,"Great shoe the traction is top tier on clean courts and outdoor courts, materials aren’t like god tier but they get the job done. In the cushion there is a cheap adidas insole, a lot of adidas shoes do it with a lot of shoes, but below it we have a full length lightstrike with crazy compression, some said it was to much for them but I think it feels nice on foot. Lacing system is good it’s easy, you just tie and your ready to go, the shoe is 13 ounces. This shoe is great get it for only 110$"
9555,206,504,7.4,2022-01-05,user_overall,"It was a good shoe, heel slippage a minor problem but It was easy to play through. The traction has a sort of break in period where it doesn't squeak, and barely bites at all until at least 3 days of play, but after that it's good. For this colorway the leather on the outside right and left sides of each shoe has a weird crease look after a lot of play. Overall good shoe, I recommend the Dame 7, not so much the EXT PLY version, and for sure not so much the ""damenosis"" colorway with the leather."
9556,206,281,7.0,2023-04-18,user_overall,I bought this shoe for 50$ at footlocker and this shoe was awful. after I broke the shoe in the traction never had a good bite even on clean courts. the cushion had little compression. and I had a major heel slippage issue even with the achilles pillows in the heel. when I was breaking the shoe in my feet hurt like crazy. I also had an issue with the insole because the insole would not stick to the bottom of the shoe making it very uncomftorable. overall I would not recommend this shoe.
9557,206,317,8.8,2023-09-17,user_overall,"The best fit on any basketball shoe I ever had. The traction is great and it lasts even playing mostly on outdoors, but the lightstrike cushion bottom-ed out after a while, so the shoe is still really good but I feel like the cushion is kind of gone. Support is really good, the materials are normal, nothing amazing but they are nice. Maybe they could use some more breathability. Overall, this is a really good shoe and I really like the way my colorway looked!"
9558,206,6,9.0,2020-10-21,traction,The traction on the Dame 7 was actually really nice. I didn't have any problems even on a mildly dusty court. You'll have to wipe if you play on really dusty courts though.
9559,206,293,9.0,2020-10-31,traction,"Playing on an outdoor court, the Dame 7 had a really good bite and I didn't have any slipping issues. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try them on an indoor court."
9560,206,6,9.0,2020-10-21,cushion,The Lightstrike cushioning in this shoe is really good. This setup has a lot of impact protection in the heel with responsiveness and court feel in the forefoot. I really like the overall balance.
9561,206,293,9.0,2020-10-31,cushion,"Full-length Lightstrike cushioning is insane! Impact protection is really nice in the heel, but not as much in the forefoot. Court feel is good in the forefoot."
9562,206,6,8.0,2020-10-21,materials,"The mesh upper material isn't the most premium, but it's a huge upgrade over the Dame 6. They get the job done performance-wise and are a step in the right direction."
9563,206,293,8.0,2020-10-31,materials,The mesh material doesn't look cheap and feels great on foot.
9564,206,6,9.0,2020-10-21,support,"I had no issues with the support in the Dame 7. No heel slippage, side to side movement on the footbed, and I felt really locked in overall."
9565,206,293,9.0,2020-10-31,support,Overall stability was nice and I had no problems with lateral containment. This shoe is super wide so lateral stability was good too.
9566,206,6,9.0,2020-10-21,fit,The materials broke in well and felt great on my foot. The overall fit is really nice.
9567,206,293,8.0,2020-10-31,fit,The fit was pretty good for me. Overall nice and snug plus easy to put on. I didn't really like the lacing system though.
9568,206,293,100.0,2020-10-31,outdoor,The durability seems really good for outdoor courts.
9569,206,293,2,2020-10-31,width,
9570,206,293,3,2020-10-31,size,These fit me well true to size.
9571,207,6,8.4,2020-09-13,expert_overall,The Kyrie Low 3 retails for $110 and I think you get a pretty solid performer for the price. The only issues I had with these were the narrowness because of my slightly wide feet and the lack of impact protection.
9572,207,293,8.2,2021-03-10,expert_overall,"Overall the Kyrie Low 3 is very similar to the Kyrie Low 2, but slightly improved. I liked the materials better and they were more comfortable."
9573,207,566,9.0,2022-09-27,user_overall,"Traction’s great, no in-shoe foot movement, didn’t take much time to break in, never felt unsafe in the shoe, took over a year for tread to even start to wear (that’s with using shoes in or outdoors at the very least once a week sometimes more ). By far the best part of this shoe: the tread of this specific colorway glows in the dark!! Lol, seriously tho, this is a great shoe for indoors and the occasional outdoors game"
9574,207,567,8.8,2022-03-15,user_overall,The Kyrie 3 low was super fun to play in! The traction was great no matter the conditions! The only downside however was they felt a little heavy. Would highly recommend for guards and wing players!
9575,207,568,7.8,2024-10-18,user_overall,"the shoe are really great but the cushion it's bad, hurt my feet and it's not wide shoe"

9577,207,570,7.6,2023-01-25,user_overall,
9578,207,6,9.0,2020-09-13,traction,The Kyrie Low 3 uses the same traction pattern as the Kyrie Low 2 and the traction was great. They gripped the floor very well on clean courts and performed well on some dusty courts.
9579,207,293,9.0,2021-03-10,traction,The traction pattern is exactly the same as the Kyrie Low 2 and should perform the same. The rubber was a bit stickier on the 3 which made for a nice bite.
9580,207,6,8.0,2020-09-13,cushion,The cushioning uses a full-length Phylon midsole and a Zoom unit in the heel and forefoot. The cushion is pretty disappointing because the Zoom units are very muted and don't provide a lot of bounce. This is a responsive setup without much impact protection.
9581,207,293,7.0,2021-03-10,cushion,"The cushion setup is also the same as the Kyrie Low 2. It's not great, but Kyrie's have never had really good cushion. The heel and forefoot Zoom unit were a little better than the Low 2, but still not great."
9582,207,6,8.0,2020-09-13,materials,"The upper is very supportive and offers a lot of containment which is a decent upgrade from the Kyrie Low 2. On foot, the materials do the job just fine."
9583,207,293,9.0,2021-03-10,materials,"I think the materials are an upgrade over the Kyrie Low 2. The upper felt a lot softer and more comfortable which was nice. The strap also looks pretty similar to the Kyrie 6, but still doesn't do much."
9584,207,6,9.0,2020-09-13,support,"The support is actually really good. I had no heel slippage, side-to-side movement on the footbed, or lateral instability even without an outrigger."
9585,207,293,8.0,2021-03-10,support,The lateral containment is very good and these are extremely wide to help with lateral stability. The heel counter is solid and should prevent any heel slippage.
9586,207,6,8.0,2020-09-13,fit,The fit is very narrow similar to every other Kyrie model. There is not much dead space in the toe box and the materials laid nicely over my feet.
9587,207,293,8.0,2021-03-10,fit,These fit exactly the same as the Kyrie Low 2 which was really snug and narrow. I think once these break in the fit will improve and loosen up a bit.
9588,207,293,1,2021-03-10,width,If you have a wide foot stay away from this shoe.
9589,207,293,2,2021-03-10,size,I'd suggest going up half a size if you don't want a really snug fit.
9590,208,33,8.7,2020-10-06,expert_overall,"The RS Dreamer is one of the best looking hoop shoes of 2020. If PUMA can improve their cushion setup then they will be a serious contender to Nike, Jordan, and Adidas. You will be satisfied if you pick up the RS Dreamer!"
9591,208,6,8.2,2020-09-15,expert_overall,"For $120, I'd say go get a pair of the RS Dreamer because these are really fun to play in. Overall these are a solid pair of shoes if you like feeling light on your feet."
9592,208,293,8.2,2020-09-15,expert_overall,The RS Dreamer is a solid all-around shoe. The great traction and support make for a shoe that almost anyone can play in. My only issues were that they are pretty heavy and the cushion setup isn't great.
9593,208,571,8.1,2022-01-23,user_overall,"The show is amazing on feet but not on court. The traction is not good. You will not get the bite or stop you will like, picks up dust like crazy and you don’t feel shifty too make quick crossovers or change of direction. Outdoor is a different story, these will grip the outdoor court way better than it did indoors. The cushion is okay, materials are fine and the support you feel locked down."
9594,208,572,8.6,2022-08-24,user_overall,"Loved it, for the time I had it. The traction was the best I’ve ever seen. It gripped perfectly, and repelled dust like a leaf blower. It started filling after a bit, but it was perfect for a while. The cushioning and materials aren’t something to write home about, but you don’t notice them. DON’T PLAY OUTSIDE in them, these shoes are not durable at all."
9595,208,358,9.0,2021-12-31,user_overall,"Cushion is responsive, but very heavy and stiff and hard. The only let down of this shoe. It feels supportive and very stable however, and with a cushioned orthotic these shoes would be up there with the best of them. Overall very stable and comfy aside from dead cushion, still pretty fun to play in regardless."
9596,208,320,8.4,2022-06-29,user_overall,"The RS Dreamer is an great shoe, once it breaks in. The cushion and materials"
9597,208,573,8.1,2022-01-07,user_overall,"Not a bad shoe at all. While not the best performer, it's a nice shoe and it's few shortcomings are compensated by its looks. (Especially this colorway)"
9598,208,33,9.5,2020-10-06,traction,The traction from PUMA has been consistently good lately and this is the case for the RS dreamer as well.
9599,208,6,9.0,2020-09-15,traction,This traction pattern reminds me of a leaf and the traction is insane on clean courts. You'll have to consistently wipe to maintain traction on dust.
9600,208,293,9.0,2020-09-15,traction,"This traction looks like a leaf and features pretty hard rubber. I only played outdoors in these, but the grip and bite was insane. They also had good bite on my wood floors indoors."
9601,208,33,7.0,2020-10-06,cushion,The ProFoam was pretty firm compared to most other cushion setups and it lacked bounce. The cushion felt somewhat dead on foot.
9602,208,6,8.0,2020-09-15,cushion,I really liked the subtle bounce in the forefoot cushion on these. Impact protection isn't the best and this is a more responsive setup. For what it is I really enjoyed it.
9603,208,293,7.0,2020-09-15,cushion,"These have really nice court feel, but the cushion didn't feel great. There wasn't much impact protection outdoors and my feet hurt after playing. This setup is very responsive and low to the ground."
9604,208,33,9.0,2020-10-06,materials,These materials are nice! The mix of old and new style materials throughout the upper performs well and didn't require any break-in time.
9605,208,6,8.0,2020-09-15,materials,"On this colorway, the mesh is pretty nice and there are some nice synthetic hits around the upper. Performance-wise the materials do what they need to and held up well."
9606,208,293,8.0,2020-09-15,materials,"The knit feels pretty nice, but not as nice as the Clyde Hardwood. It is thin and conforms well to your foot. The materials aren't the most premium, but they get the job done."
9607,208,33,9.0,2020-10-06,support,The support is similar to the Clyde Hardwood. This shoe has all the standard support features you've come to expect and does the job well.
9608,208,6,8.0,2020-09-15,support,I think the support has everything you want and nothing you don't. No side to side movement on the foot bed and the base was wide enough for lateral movements. Support wasn't over the top or too minimal and has everything I want in a shoe.
9609,208,293,9.0,2020-09-15,support,Lateral containment is never going to be an issue and the base of the shoe is pretty wide. You feel stable and supported in this shoe.
9610,208,33,9.0,2020-10-06,fit,"The lockdown was solid for me when I was playing, but the materials did stretch out a little. After a couple of games, I had to tighten the laces, and then everything was great."
9611,208,6,8.0,2020-09-15,fit,There is a little bit of dead space in the toe box area but the fit was good everywhere else.
9612,208,293,8.0,2020-09-15,fit,Ran a little long and there was a little dead space in the toe box. They are easy to put on and fit well overall.
9613,208,6,50.0,2020-09-15,outdoor,I had some solid wear after playing in these for a week and a half.
9614,208,293,100.0,2020-09-15,outdoor,These have high abrasion rubber and worked well for me outdoors.
9615,208,293,2,2020-09-15,width,Wide footers may want to go up half a size.
9616,208,6,3,2020-09-15,size,True to size worked well for me.
9617,208,293,3,2020-09-15,size,I went true to size and it worked well for me.
9618,209,6,8.4,2020-09-22,expert_overall,Overall the LeBron Soldier 14 is a very solid performer for $140 and a lot of fun to play in.
9619,209,293,8.4,2020-09-22,expert_overall,"The Lebron Soldier 14 wasn't my favorite shoe to ball in because of the traction and the stiff heel cushioning. Not the best fit for guards, but if you're a big dude then I think these would be pretty nice."
9620,209,2,8.2,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron Soldier 14 is a solid performing shoe. Despite not being a mainline LeBron signature, Nike didn't cut any corners on the cushion in this model. The traction is also what you'd come to expect from the Soldier line. It's grippy and durable. Overall, I really enjoyed playing in this shoe."
9621,209,410,8.2,2023-02-07,user_overall,"I got these shoes from the nike outlet at a discounted price. The shoe is decent, its traction is basic because it does slip a little bit sometimes. The shoe is kinda thick but its not heavy at any way. There are way better shoes for the price. I think it fits better for big centers that usually stay close to the basket. For outdoor use it's fine but not the most recommended shoe for outdoor use."
9622,209,574,8.5,2023-01-28,user_overall,"They have a huge zoom unit and i really enjoy this cushining system. The traction is good, I didnt notice any slipping, but idk how they proform for outdoors. Fit isn't bad but i had a tiny bit of discomfort in my pinky toes. I've heard these are best for larger players but as a, 5'9 140lbs player, they were fine. I recommend them especially when at a discount at the outlet"
9623,209,575,8.0,2022-02-10,user_overall,"Okay, the shoes were okay. I not saying it was bad but it wasn't amazing either, the traction was decent but it wasn't really good, the slide outs were almost dangerous but it wasn´t as bad because the support is amazing much the best part of the shoe, cushion is good, the fit is meh, and playing outdoors should be fine enough"
9624,209,576,9.0,2022-02-07,user_overall,Amazing shoes.. save my ankle for several occation. Have a excelent grip both indoor or outdoor. Thanks to XDR technology
9625,209,577,8.4,2022-08-20,user_overall,
9626,209,6,8.0,2020-09-22,traction,Very similar traction pattern to the Lebron 17 and it took a little while to break in but then they stop on a dime. You'll need to consistently wipe if you're playing on a dusty court.
9627,209,293,7.0,2020-09-22,traction,"The bite on the floor wasn't that good. I'd slide out a little on hard movements, but they were fine otherwise. Keep in mind I was playing in these outdoors."
9628,209,2,9.0,2021-05-06,traction,I loved the traction of the LeBron Soldier 14. It stuck to the court really well.
9629,209,6,8.0,2020-09-22,cushion,The full-length Cushlon and Zoom units felt very bouncy in the forefoot and stable in the heel. The rubber caging around the midsole masked some of the cushion which was disappointing.
9630,209,293,9.0,2020-09-22,cushion,"The cushion was one of my favorite parts of this shoe. The forefoot Zoom was awesome and felt insane, but the heel Zoom unit was disappointing. Not a lot of court feel if you are looking for that."
9631,209,2,8.0,2021-05-06,cushion,"The Zoom unit in the heel feels more prominent, and it feels very bouncy. The Cushlon also helps you feel the Zoom in the forefoot as well."
9632,209,6,8.0,2020-09-22,materials,The woven upper was really nice for the price point and felt good on foot. Overall the material usage was really solid.
9633,209,293,8.0,2020-09-22,materials,The super-thin woven material felt great and the rest of the materials used on these were actually pretty nice. The ventilation was pretty good too.
9634,209,2,8.0,2021-05-06,materials,A nylon mesh and fuse upper make up most of the upper. The materials are thick and durable but remain comfortable.
9635,209,6,9.0,2020-09-22,support,I had no issues with the support in these. I was covered in terms of lateral stability and containment plus the materials kept my foot locked in.
9636,209,293,10.0,2020-09-22,support,Support and lockdown were awesome. No problems with lateral containment and stability.
9637,209,2,8.0,2021-05-06,support,The materials help to cradle your foot laterally. The cushion also rises up the sides of the shoe a bit to help provide additional support.
9638,209,6,9.0,2020-09-22,fit,"I had no pinching on the side of my foot which was great and they had a nice 1 to 1 fit. I had an issue where it was really hard to slide my foot into the shoe at first and I didn't like that the laces were hidden by the shroud, but overall the fit was really nice."
9639,209,293,8.0,2020-09-22,fit,The toe box area was snug and overall the fit was great. They were not the easiest to put on though because of the one-booty upper.
9640,209,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,I enjoyed the fit. It was more accommodating than previous Solider models.
9641,209,293,0.0,2020-09-22,outdoor,These wore out pretty quickly on an outdoor court.
9642,209,2,100.0,2021-05-06,outdoor,The rubber compound has yet to fray after testing it outdoors.
9643,209,293,2,2020-09-22,width,These were a little narrow so watch out for that if you have wide feet.
9644,209,2,3,2021-05-06,width,"The shoe is wide foot friendly with ample toe space in the forefoot, but you still may want to go up half a size."
9645,209,293,3,2020-09-22,size,True to size fit me really well.
9646,209,2,3,2021-05-06,size,Go true to size for regular footers.
9647,210,33,8.6,2020-09-30,expert_overall,"Overall, I think Under Armour did very well with the Embiid 1. The traction and the cushion were high points of the shoe and everything else is solid all-around. Any player and position can wear these and they're good for outdoor use too."
9648,210,293,8.2,2020-10-02,expert_overall,I really enjoyed playing in the Embiid 1! It's a really supportive and responsive shoe that you never have to worry about. Solid all around and will be loosely in my rotation.
9649,210,32,8.0,2020-10-24,expert_overall,The Embiid 1 is a solid shoe especially for the price of $120. Every aspect of these performed pretty well and they were ready to go out of the box. Any position or player can play in these.
9650,210,2,8.0,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"The use of Micro G and HOVR provided a great cushioning setup that provided plenty of impact protection while still being bouncy. The traction played well after breaking in, and the materials feel nice when playing. Although, I do wish they were a bit more premium. Overall, the Embiid 1 is built well for performance basketball."
9651,210,6,7.8,2020-10-04,expert_overall,"The Embiid 1 retailed for $120, but I can't recommend them because of the traction issues I had. If you play on really clean courts then you should be fine, but otherwise, you'll probably have issues."
9652,210,455,8.0,2022-02-09,user_overall,"I didn’t really like this shoe. The cushion was pretty subpar, all response and little compression. The materials were pretty solid, nice and durable while being supportive and relatively minimal. Traction was well above average, on both dusty and clean courts. It’s a pretty decent performance shoe, but it just wasn’t for me. Made my feel hurt like a b****."
9653,210,578,7.6,2023-05-29,user_overall,"Traction and Cushioning are not the best, but they are serviceable. The material feels slightly cheap in certain parts but mostly remained decent. Durable on both in and out door courts. Fits decently nice though sizing should go up about half a size."
9654,210,579,8.6,2022-04-14,user_overall,It was a great show to hoop in. My opinion might be a bit unpopular but I said what I said. The biggest let down was the cushion in my opinion.
9655,210,31,7.6,2024-12-15,user_overall,"I got my insole slipping all over the place and the lacing system kind annoying, other than that, it is a pretty solid shoes"
9656,210,551,7.5,2022-11-05,user_overall,"They were ok but nothing amazing, for the price point there were other shoes that were better at the time."
9657,210,33,9.0,2020-09-30,traction,"This traction pattern looked a lot like the Nike Kobe 9 but didn't perform as well as those. It was still grippy on the court, but I had a little slipping in the center of the forefoot. It wasn't too much of an issue because the rest of the outsole worked just fine."
9658,210,293,8.0,2020-10-02,traction,"The traction and bite was great after a little break-in on an outdoor court. I didn't get to try them indoors, but I've found that the outdoor traction performance usually correlates to indoor performance."
9659,210,32,8.0,2020-10-24,traction,This unique outsole pattern offers decent grip and traction. It's not top-tier but performs well overall.
9660,210,2,8.0,2021-05-06,traction,The traction is made of a thick rubber material but is pretty pliable. It does take some time to break in before they start to really bite.
9661,210,6,6.0,2020-10-04,traction,The traction pattern wasn't great for me. It was really inconsistent on somewhat clean and dirty courts. I was sliding to a stop most of the time even when I was wiping consistently.
9662,210,33,9.0,2020-09-30,cushion,The full-length Micro G and HOVR heel puck provide a balanced ride which is very comfortable and stable at the same time.
9663,210,293,8.0,2020-10-02,cushion,"The court feel is really good and the impact protection is okay. For the most part, they felt great with good compression and responsiveness."
9664,210,32,9.0,2020-10-24,cushion,"I really enjoyed the very responsive and comfortable cushioning, plus I got a decent amount of court feel."
9665,210,2,8.0,2021-05-06,cushion,"The HOVR puck used in the heel feels very good compared to the HOVR used in the Curry shoes, and the Micro G cushioning in the rest of the shoe is bouncy and plush."
9666,210,6,9.0,2020-10-04,cushion,"The cushion was pretty good and I really liked it. It has a good mix of court feel, impact protection, and bounce. Way better than the Micro G in the Curry 7."
9667,210,33,7.0,2020-09-30,materials,"These materials are pretty basic, but they perform well. They are breathable and didn't require any break-in time."
9668,210,293,8.0,2020-10-02,materials,"The materials aren't great for $120, but they get the job done. On foot they felt awesome - I have no complaints about the performance."
9669,210,32,8.0,2020-10-24,materials,"The materials are pretty light and very breathable which I didn't expect. They don't feel the most premium, but they get the job done performance-wise. They also didn't require any break-in time."
9670,210,2,8.0,2021-05-06,materials,The mesh upper has a honeycomb net for extra reinforcement. It feels very soft and comfortable.
9671,210,6,8.0,2020-10-04,materials,"The open-holed mesh wasn't the most premium, but performance-wise it gets the job done really well. Offers good ventilation as well."
9672,210,33,9.0,2020-09-30,support,"The support is similar to other models from Under Armour over the past few years. Supportive enough for a 7-foot center, but still quick enough for a guard type player."
9673,210,293,9.0,2020-10-02,support,I had no issues with the support and lockdown. Joel Embiid needs a lot of support and I got a lot of it with this shoe. However - you won't get any ankle support with these even though they're a Mid.
9674,210,32,8.0,2020-10-24,support,The TPU wing adds a lot of support and stability while keeping my foot on the footbed. The mid-cut is nice and kept my foot locked in.
9675,210,2,8.0,2021-05-06,support,"The heel is well padded, and the internal heel plate also does a good job of containing your foot. It uses plastic wings that come up the side of the footbed to keep you locked in laterally."
9676,210,6,8.0,2020-10-04,support,The support is perfectly fine and has everything that I want from a basketball sneaker. I experienced no side to side movement on the footbed and I felt really contained.
9677,210,33,9.0,2020-09-30,fit,The lockdown is awesome - I have no complaints! The lacing system works well and kept my foot in place on the footbed at all times.
9678,210,293,8.0,2020-10-02,fit,"The fit was pretty good, but not as good as some of the Curry models. They did stretch out a little after breaking in so keep that in mind."
9679,210,32,8.0,2020-10-24,fit,"The shoe was okay comfort-wise, fit well, and got the job done. There is a little dead space in the toe box, but not enough to go down half a size."
9680,210,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,The fit is a bit loose if you don't go down half a size with a regular-sized foot.
9681,210,6,8.0,2020-10-04,fit,The lacing system worked well and helped customize how tight I wanted the shoe to be. There is a little dead space in the toe box. The fit overall was really good.
9682,210,293,0.0,2020-10-02,outdoor,"They performed well outdoors, but the outsole had the worst durability out of all of the shoes I've tested recently. I'd stay away from them for outdoor use."
9683,210,2,0.0,2021-05-06,outdoor,The rubber is tearing away and doesn't seem to be durable enough for outdoor wear.
9684,210,2,4,2021-05-06,width,Good fit for wide feet.
9685,210,6,3,2020-10-04,width,Wide footers should be good going true to size.
9686,210,293,3,2020-10-02,size,True to size fit me well similar to other Under Armour models.
9687,210,2,4,2021-05-06,size,"If you have a regular-sized foot, you can go half a size down, but if you have a wide foot, true to size should work."
9688,210,6,3,2020-10-04,size,These fit true to size for me.
9689,211,32,9.0,2020-10-17,expert_overall,"The Kybrid S2 is a well-performing hoop shoe. I liked the combination of the Kyrie 4, 5, and 6! The cushion and the traction could have been a little better though."
9690,211,6,8.4,2020-10-17,expert_overall,The Kyrie Kybrid S2 is a great performing shoe besides the traction. I wish they used the traction and cushion setups from the Kyrie 5 or 6 because I think those were better. I would recommend these if you play on mostly clean courts.
9691,211,472,7.9,2024-01-07,user_overall,"The traction of the Kybrids meets expectation, the multi-directional pattern really helps while making side to side movements. Cushioning, I was rather disappointed. I really wish they used the Kyrie 5 cushioning with the zoom turbo instead of the Kyrie 4 which just has a zoom heel unit. Support was great, I was comfortable making cuts to the basket. Breathability was an issue for me, I felt my feet getting quite moist after games which I did not like, not much ventilation in this shoe."
9692,211,580,8.2,2021-11-06,user_overall,I loved how these shoes looked and felt but their traction and cushion were eh. The traction was decent on clean courts but needed some wiping on mildly dusty courts. The cushion was just not there. I recommend this shoe for guards.
9693,211,568,9.3,2025-04-18,user_overall,"Tiene un agarre increíble en canchas interiores y exteriores, aunque el usarlos para exterior me dolió las probé y no me fue mal, el peso del par no se sintió mucho, para movimientos bruscos son buenos."
9694,211,581,8.2,2022-07-20,user_overall,
9695,211,496,8.8,2022-10-06,user_overall,
9696,211,32,8.0,2020-10-17,traction,"The Kybrid S2 reuses the outsole from the Kyrie 4 and the performance of the traction is pretty inconsistent. On clean courts, they did well, but on mild dust or worse I had to do some wiping."
9697,211,6,8.0,2020-10-17,traction,"The traction pattern taken from the Kyrie 4 works well on clean courts. On dusty courts, I had to wipe a decent amount and the traction was inconsistent."
9698,211,32,7.0,2020-10-17,cushion,Zoom Air in the heel and none in the forefoot was slightly disappointing. The cushion is quite responsive and you are low to the ground which is nice.
9699,211,6,8.0,2020-10-17,cushion,"This nice cushion setup is recycled from the Kyrie 4. I wish that the Zoom Air unit was in the forefoot instead of the heel, but overall the cushion performed well and was comfortable."
9700,211,32,8.0,2020-10-17,materials,"The combination of materials from the 5 and 6 is pretty solid. In terms of feel and comfort these are nice, but be aware that there is no ventilation."
9701,211,6,8.0,2020-10-17,materials,The engineered mesh material from the Kyrie 5 used here is sturdy and feels nice on foot. Performance wise they got the job done just fine.
9702,211,32,9.0,2020-10-17,support,The Venus flytrap overlay did a way better job locking my foot down than the strap from the Kyrie 6. The heel counter on the back worked great and overall these had great support.
9703,211,6,9.0,2020-10-17,support,"As expected, the support is great in the Kybrid S2. I had no lateral stability or containment issues and felt locked in by the flytrap."
9704,211,32,9.0,2020-10-17,fit,The fit was really good and the shroud wrapped around my foot well. I got a good snug fit and comfort was solid.
9705,211,6,9.0,2020-10-17,fit,The fit is similar to the rest of the Kyrie and everything felt really nice and snug once I was laced up.
9706,211,6,3,2020-10-17,size,I'd go true to size if you don't have wide feet.
9707,212,32,9.0,2020-08-02,expert_overall,"The D.O.N. Issue #2 definitely has some improvements over the #1, but some aspects were worse such as the traction. You're getting solid lockdown and support with these and a responsive cushioning setup. For the price of $100, you're getting a pretty good performance hoop shoe."
9708,212,33,8.6,2020-11-06,expert_overall,The Adidas D.O.N. Issue 2 is a surprise hit indoors for me. They are a great bang for your buck shoe at only $100!
9709,212,6,8.0,2020-09-14,expert_overall,"I had fun playing in these while I could tolerate the pain in the forefoot, but eventually I just had to switch shoes. These were solid for the price and are a good pickup if you don't have the same fit issue as me."
9710,212,293,7.6,2020-08-29,expert_overall,"It is kind of hard for me to recommend the D.O.N. Issue #2 as I didn't really enjoy playing in these. The cushioning was good, materials were a little too thick, and they are pretty heavy. If you don't mind bigger and bulkier shoes and want something that is really supportive with pretty nice cushioning than you should give these a try. They definitely weren't for me though."
9711,212,446,8.8,2022-03-23,user_overall,"Absolutely amazing hoop shoe in my opinion. Great cushion and traction, specially on in"
9712,212,582,8.8,2022-06-17,user_overall,"The shoe feels nice and secure around my feet. The traction performs well on clean/non-dusty courts. The cushioning is amazing Im a 6'3 190 pound guard who jumps/dunks a lot and Im pretty heavy on my feet. The impact protection on the shoe is great and has good court feel. I wish these shoes played better on dusty floors. I've had these shoes for almost 2 years and the materials are starting to tear, but surprisingly they're still holding up EXTREMELY WELL."
9713,212,583,7.5,2023-06-10,user_overall,"Hmm what I would tell you for this shoes. I didn't feel like I had foot stability. somehow my foot was not sure in these sneakers. They are by no means for dusty terrains. When the soles are worn a little, they are no longer so reliable even for clean terrain because they slide a lot. the lace holders broke quickly all the ones I had to replace."
9714,212,361,8.6,2022-01-31,user_overall,"I like the D.O.N. Issue #2, there’s some pretty good pros, but there’s also cons that make it so I can’t recommend it to everyone. One, they’re more heavier than usual. Two, they’re pretty bulky. If you’re a guard that wants a light and minimal shoe, this isn’t for you. It gets the job done."
9715,212,525,9.3,2022-03-12,user_overall,It was just overall perfect I loved the feel and my first game playing with it I scored 73 points with 10 rebounds and 7 assists. This shoe is very good but if I could change one thing it would be to make it a little bit bigger. Overall this shoe is great
9716,212,32,7.0,2020-08-02,traction,"The traction is very inconsistent depending on the type of surface you're playing on. Some surfaces the shoe was biting the floor really well and some I was slipping and sliding. The inconsistencies could be due to the translucent outsole, so hopefully, the solid colorways perform better."
9717,212,33,9.0,2020-11-06,traction,The traction indoors is awesome and much better than in the D.O.N. Issue 1. They don't pick up much dust so you don't need to wipe much.
9718,212,6,8.0,2020-09-14,traction,"The spiderweb inspired traction was pretty good for the most part. I got a really nice bite on clean courts, but make sure you wipe on dusty courts because I slipped sometimes."
9719,212,293,7.0,2020-08-29,traction,"This traction pretty mediocre. The bite was good, but you slide out a bit on hard movements. I only tested these on an outdoor court, but I've been able to figure out how shoes will do indoors based on outdoor performance. I don't think performance will be great on these indoors."
9720,212,32,8.0,2020-08-02,cushion,"Adidas slimmed down the Bounce in the midsole, so these are a lot less bulky compared to the #1s. The feel is bouncy and responsive and very similar to last year. You get decent court feel as well."
9721,212,33,7.0,2020-11-06,cushion,"This cushion setup uses Bounce, but it's not as plush and rubbery as we are used to. The focus here is on mobility and court feel similar to the Kyrie line."
9722,212,6,9.0,2020-09-14,cushion,The Bounce cushioning in this shoe was really nice. You get a lot of impact protection in the heel and solid court feel in the forefoot. I think Bounce is underrated and it was really nice in the D.O.N Issue 2.
9723,212,293,9.0,2020-08-29,cushion,"I really like the cushioning here. They're using a full length Bounce cushioning and it has a good amount of compression in the heel. It feels nice and bouncy. Court feel isn't the best, but impact protection was really good. Cushion overall was pretty dang nice."
9724,212,32,8.0,2020-08-02,materials,"The materials on the #2s have been improved over the #1s and the mesh feels a lot more soft and flexible. They feel pretty thick and durable with reinforced areas in high wear areas. The padded tongue is also really nice. If you like a shoe that gives you a cozy, snug, and padded feel then these are it."
9725,212,33,9.0,2020-11-06,materials,"Made of lightweight textiles and synthetic overlays. Nothing stands out, but they do well performance-wise."
9726,212,6,8.0,2020-09-14,materials,"The mesh upper is well contained and very supportive. It felt good on foot, but was pretty thick which isn't for everyone. These materials are pretty good for the price point."
9727,212,293,7.0,2020-08-29,materials,The materials are okay. These have a mesh upper and a cheap-feeling synthetic on the inside of the foot. The materials are also pretty thick and a bit bulky. The padding around the ankle and tongue does feel really nice though.
9728,212,32,8.0,2020-08-02,support,"The support here was made for Donovan Mitchell's hard cuts and quick pull up jumpers, so these get the job done in that aspect. The lacing system is simple and works really well. The base of the shoe is wide, so there is good lateral stability here."
9729,212,33,9.0,2020-11-06,support,Great torsional and heel support and the flat and wide base provide a lot of stability.
9730,212,6,9.0,2020-09-14,support,I thought the support was one of the better features of the shoe. I had no instabilities on lateral movements or sliding on the footbed. The setup really has everything you want.
9731,212,293,9.0,2020-08-29,support,I had no issues with the support and it was one of the strong points of the shoe. The shoe feels supportive like a tank. No issues with lateral containment and lateral stability since these have a wide base.
9732,212,33,9.0,2020-11-06,fit,These have a snug fit with good lockdown. Lace them all the way up to prevent the heel from feeling floppy.
9733,212,6,6.0,2020-09-14,fit,The fit was pretty weird for me. The forefoot area was really tight and pretty painful for me on lateral movements. There was always constant pressure in the forefoot. Other than that the fit was pretty good everywhere else.
9734,212,293,6.0,2020-08-29,fit,"These fit kind of weird on me. They were snug on the top of the toe box, but then got roomy on the top farther down my foot. It was also kind of tight on the lateral side of my feet. I could never get the fit the way I wanted it and I got some needles playing in these."
9735,212,293,0.0,2020-08-29,outdoor,These weren't great outdoors and durability wasn't good. They also don't have the deepest grooves.
9736,212,6,2,2020-09-14,width,Wide footers should go up half a size or maybe stay away from this shoe.
9737,212,293,3,2020-08-29,width,The width on these was normal.
9738,212,6,3,2020-09-14,size,True to size is the way to go for these.
9739,212,293,4,2020-08-29,size,These were a little long so I'd recommend going down half a size.
9740,213,32,9.0,2020-08-04,expert_overall,"For $120, the Zoom Freak 2s is an affordable signature sneaker that offers a good amount of tech. It doesn't really have a weak point and should be good for all types of hoopers whether you are a guard or a big man. Definitely an upgrade over the Zoom Freak 1s!"
9741,213,293,8.4,2020-08-21,expert_overall,The Nike Zoom Freak 2 feels extremely light and minimal on foot and I really like it. It is one of those shoes you can put on and just focus on playing ball regardless of position. It isn't clunky or heavy on foot and just feels smooth. The only downside was that there isn't a lot of impact protection provided from this cushion setup. This shoe performs really well for the price!
9742,213,2,8.2,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"Nike really listened and made positive changes in the Zoom Freak 2. The support is better and your foot feels secure and locked in. The cushion is improved with the forefoot Zoom unit, and the traction grips well on most court conditions."
9743,213,6,8.0,2020-08-07,expert_overall,"For $120, I think you're getting a fantastic shoe with the Nike Zoom Freak 2. It's a perfect shoe for guards because you'll feel quick and responsive on your feet. If you are looking for a lot of impact protection this isn't the shoe for you. If you want to pick up a pair, I think you won't be disappointed!"
9744,213,221,7.5,2020-11-25,expert_overall,The inconsistent traction never allowed me to feel safe in the Nike Zoom Freak 2. There wasn't anything else that was exciting or stood out in this shoe either.
9745,213,584,6.9,2022-03-10,user_overall,"I had two foot injuries while using this shoe, maybe because the cushion w"
9746,213,214,7.8,2023-04-02,user_overall,"The Zoom Freak 2 introduced a forefoot zoom air unit to the Zoom Freak line. The double stacked zoom units in the heel were swapped out for a thicker heel made with solid phylon. The bounce was improved, but the shoe still has good court feel. Fit and lockdown on this shoe are great, but they do run narrow (especially in the toebox).Traction is good, but the shoe does pick up dust easily."
9747,213,585,8.8,2022-01-12,user_overall,"Honestly a surprisingly great shoe. I thought it wasn't going to feel good using it (as it was designed for Giannis, who is a big man, and me being a not so big guard), but it turns out that it is arguably one of the best shoes for a point guard. From good traction, to holding your foot, to you being able to move shifty without uncomfortableness, it had it all."
9748,213,403,9.9,2022-11-06,user_overall,"This is the best basketball shoe I've worn so far. Maximum traction, maximum support, perfect fit, and the colorways are amazing. No flaws at all, but the only bad thing I experienced was after 4-5 months, the side of the sole of the show was detaching. I highly recommend getting this shoe although it's hard to find these days cause it's an older model."
9749,213,437,9.2,2023-02-20,user_overall,"This shoe has great court feel in the forefoot with plenty of padded protection in the heel. The lockdown is great with no heel slippage, even with my narrow heel. The traction is also reliable. However, after only a couple months of playing in them, they started ripping on the lateral fore foot area between the upper fabric and midsole."
9750,213,32,8.0,2020-08-04,traction,"The traction is pretty good on the Zoom Freak 2. They grip the floor really, really well, but I did slip a bit on dusty courts. Overall, the traction is definitely better than the Zoom Freak 1."
9751,213,293,9.0,2020-08-21,traction,"The traction on these is really really good. I only got to try them outdoors, but even on a dusty outdoor court they were great. They had a nice squeak and bite on my wood floors inside, so I feel like it'll have good performance on an indoor court."
9752,213,2,8.0,2021-05-06,traction,"The decoupled outsole feels fast, and the rubber is very grippy."
9753,213,6,9.0,2020-08-07,traction,"The traction on the Zoom Freak 2 is really, really good. If you're playing on clean courts you'll stop on a dime, if you are playing on dusty courts you will have to wipe consistently."
9754,213,221,6.0,2020-11-25,traction,The traction is something you need to look out for. Every time planted my feet the outsole would slip out a little.
9755,213,32,8.0,2020-08-04,cushion,The Zoom Air in the forefoot has good responsiveness bringing in the feelings of a Kobe sneaker and is an upgrade over the Freak 1 which had the Zoom Air in the heel. The shoe also has good absorption for impact protection.
9756,213,293,7.0,2020-08-21,cushion,"As far as the cushioning goes, it is not that nice. The soft foam Nike uses isn't that soft and the heel is pretty stiff. There isn't that much impact protection and this cushion setup feels like the PG 1. Really good court feel though and the shoe feels really responsive. The cushion was a bit of a letdown."
9757,213,2,8.0,2021-05-06,cushion,The forefoot Zoom unit is bouncy while letting the Zoom Freak 2 still feel low to the ground.
9758,213,6,7.0,2020-08-07,cushion,"I found the cushioning to be pretty firm and I think the foam in the Zoom Freak 1 might have been a bit nicer. There is good court feel and responsiveness, but the impact protection is very minimal."
9759,213,221,7.0,2020-11-25,cushion,"The cushion won't hurt you, but there isn't that much impact protection here. There is a single Zoom unit in the forefoot and the foam through the rest of the midsole is pretty stiff. Overall, the cushion is pretty disappointing."
9760,213,32,7.0,2020-08-04,materials,"The materials on these aren't the greatest-feeling, but they get the job done and are an improvement over the Zoom Freak 1s. The ventilation is poor and my feet were pretty steaming after hooping in these."
9761,213,293,9.0,2020-08-21,materials,"I really like the materials used here. The upper is very thin, minimal, and super soft. There is some fuse around the toe box for added durability as well. My favorite part about the shoe is the oversized tongue which feels really nice on foot. The padding around the ankle is good too. My only issue was that the ventilation wasn't great and these were hot to play in."
9762,213,2,8.0,2021-05-06,materials,The upper is very supportive and needs no break-in time. It feels comfortable and nice on foot.
9763,213,6,7.0,2020-08-07,materials,"The materials on the Zoom Freak 2 feature an all mesh upper with some hits of synthetic leather. These aren't the nicest materials, but overall they get the job done."
9764,213,221,9.0,2020-11-25,materials,The materials are soft and comfortable and fit nicely around your foot.
9765,213,32,8.0,2020-08-04,support,The decoupled outsole gives you more flexibility when making movements which is really good. What I really like is that the lateral outrigger and the wing support your foot when making lateral movements. The support is one of the stronger aspects of this shoe.
9766,213,293,8.0,2020-08-21,support,I had no issues with the support at all. The rubberized plastic keep you locked in for lateral movements and overall containment. The internal heel counter is great too. Lateral stability is good because of the crazy outrigger on these that comes out pretty wide. This is a low so keep in mind there isn't any ankle support.
9767,213,2,9.0,2021-05-06,support,The added TPU plates on the lateral side of the shoe keep your foot on the footbed. The upper also does a good job of keeping you locked in.
9768,213,6,8.0,2020-08-07,support,I think the support is really good in the Zoom Freak 2. There is an internal heel counter that locks you in perfectly and there was no side to side movement on the footbed. These have you covered on lateral movements as well with outriggers for extra support.  Solid torsional rigidity and stability too.
9769,213,293,9.0,2020-08-21,fit,The fit was incredible for me and it fit very similar to the Zoom Freak 1. The shoe stretches out a little bit as you break it in. These are also very easy to put on because the tongue opens up a lot.
9770,213,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,"The forefoot area feels a little snug as there isn't much space in the toe box, but it does fit well."
9771,213,6,9.0,2020-08-07,fit,The fit on this shoe is really nice besides some minor rubbing on the side of my foot. Everything hugs your foot very well like a burrito and you feel comfortable and locked in.
9772,213,221,8.0,2020-11-25,fit,"The overall fit was a nice and snug experience, but the pattern on the medial side can cause some issues if you have wide feet."
9773,213,293,50.0,2020-08-21,outdoor,"The traction works well outdoors, but the nubs on the medial side of outsole aren't the most durable."
9774,213,2,100.0,2021-05-06,outdoor,The rubber is very hard. It should be good for outdoor use.
9775,213,2,3,2021-05-06,width,"It isn't narrow, but there is not much space in the forefoot. So, wide footers might want to go up half a size."
9776,213,6,1,2020-08-07,width,If you have really wide feet you may want to avoid this shoe or try it on in stores.
9777,213,293,3,2020-08-21,size,I went true to size and my foot was snug which is how I like my shoes.
9778,213,2,3,2021-05-06,size,Go true to size if you have a regular foot.
9779,213,6,3,2020-08-07,size,I have a slightly wide foot so I decided to go up a half size and am glad that I did. True to size should be fine if you don't have wide feet.
9780,214,6,8.6,2020-08-07,expert_overall,These retail for $150 which is $30 less than the original Adidas N3XT L3V3L. I think this is a step in the right direction and I you're getting a great performer for the price. This is one of the best implementations of Lightstrike and overall a unique shoe that is worth it.
9781,214,293,8.6,2020-08-19,expert_overall,"Overall I was very surprised with the Adidas N3XT L3V3L 2020. I didn't think I would like them, but I got to playing and I really really like it. Everything was really nice and comfortable, but I did miss laces a bit. I would definitely recommend these and think that any position could play in them."
9782,214,586,8.6,2021-11-26,user_overall,The Adidas n3xt l3v3l 2020 features a multi-directionnal traction pattern which works well on clean court but suffers on dusty court. The outsole is also v

9786,214,6,8.0,2020-08-07,traction,"The traction was actually pretty good. On clean courts, I had no problems, but the outsole picks up dust pretty easily so you'll have to wipe on dirty courts."
9787,214,293,9.0,2020-08-19,traction,"I only got to test these outdoors, but I was really happy with the bite and overall performance. The traction on my wood floors indoors seemed really good as well. Definitely an improvement over the first-gen!"
9788,214,6,9.0,2020-08-07,cushion,The full length Lightstrike is just as amazing as it was in the first version of this shoe. It provides a very light foam with a lot of impact protection considering how much court feel and responsiveness there is. This is my favorite cushion setup from Adidas.
9789,214,293,9.0,2020-08-19,cushion,The cushioning is incredible with full length Lightstrike that gives you some subtle bounce. You have really good impact protection and are pretty low to the ground. Overall very very nice.
9790,214,6,9.0,2020-08-07,materials,Just like the first N3XT L3V3L this also features a full Primeknit upper. You also have some nice synthetic hits around the upper for extra durability. These are very similar to the last shoe and it feels very comfortable on your foot because there are no laces. Overall material usage is really nice.
9791,214,293,9.0,2020-08-19,materials,The materials are a full knit material like a sock and I love it. When I was playing it felt very comfortable on my foot. It doesn't feel like you're glued down and is miles better than the first N3XT L3V3L.
9792,214,6,9.0,2020-08-07,support,In terms of support I didn't have any issue with the shoe. There are some nice achilles pillows and an internal heel counter so I had no heel slippage which was awesome. I also had no side to side movement on the footbed and felt very stable on side to side movements. The materials help with containment a lot.
9793,214,293,9.0,2020-08-19,support,I had no issues with support and it was really really good. The foam comes up in the in the mid-foot and for lateral containment my foot was locked in. Lateral stability was also really nice because the outsole is very flat and wide. No heel slippage at all and the achilles pillows were nice.
9794,214,6,8.0,2020-08-07,fit,"A great fitting shoe. As a slightly wide footer, I had no pain in the forefoot area which was nice. Putting your foot inside the shoe at first is really hard, but it gets a bit easier after a while."
9795,214,293,7.0,2020-08-19,fit,The fit was a little disappointing to me because it runs pretty long. Other than that it was pretty good. There wasn't a lot of dead space in the toe box and overall the fit was okay. One thing to know is that they will be super hard to put on the first few times.
9796,214,293,100.0,2020-08-19,outdoor,These were great outdoors and durability of the outsole seemed really good.
9797,214,293,3,2020-08-19,width,The width felt normal to me.
9798,214,293,4,2020-08-19,size,You should go half a size down in these because they run pretty long.
9799,215,293,8.3,2020-08-17,expert_overall,"For $80, this is a beastly performer. This is the best budget model available right now, even better than the KD Trey 5 VIII."
9800,215,6,7.6,2020-08-17,expert_overall,"For only $80, I can't complain. The materials feel budget and the Renew cushioning isn't as nice as in the KD Trey 5 VIII. But the fit, traction, and support are good."

9802,215,504,7.2,2022-01-05,user_overall,"The shoe was great to me, the durability is amazing. I played in the literal street for 5 months and it still was able to compete indoors, but it did take a beating though. The cushion was good for the price of the shoe, materials not so much. The heel of the shoe has like a cardboard feeling piece in it and that get weird, but unnoticeable in game"
9803,215,477,8.0,2023-06-04,user_overall,Great affordable hoop shoe. Great performance outdoors.

9806,215,293,8.0,2020-08-17,traction,The stopping power is good and I had no issue with sliding out on the outdoor courts I played on.
9807,215,6,8.0,2020-08-17,traction,"The traction is really good. On clean courts, you will have no problems at all. On dirty courts, dust will get stuck in-between the grooves of the traction pattern and you will need to wipe from time to time."
9808,215,293,9.0,2020-08-17,cushion,The foam in the heel is very soft and gives you a nice subtle bounce. The forefoot was super nice in the beginning but bottoms out a little bit after a while. I would take Nike Renew over Phylon every day of the week - one of my favorite cushioning setup I've played in recently.
9809,215,6,7.0,2020-08-17,cushion,The Renew cushioning feels much firmer compared to the KD Trey 5 VIII. There is only minimal impact protection but you get a lot of court feel.
9810,215,293,8.0,2020-08-17,materials,The Mesh looks and feels cheap but it's pretty comfortable on foot. Nothing to complain about!
9811,215,6,7.0,2020-08-17,materials,"The Mesh materials look and feel cheap, but they get the job done."
9812,215,293,8.0,2020-08-17,support,"The Swoosh on the lateral side cages in your feet. Lateral containment was very good, and the flat base is very stable on cuts."
9813,215,6,8.0,2020-08-17,support,Ho heel slippage thanks to the external heel counter and no side-to-side movement on the footbed because of the Nike Swoosh that acts as a barrier on the lateral side. The base is wide enough to provide stability on cuts and crosses.
9814,215,6,8.0,2020-08-17,fit,There is a little bit of dead space on the top of the toe box - but this never bothered me too much. Players with flat feet might have issues because of the rubber that comes up on the medial side.
9815,215,293,100.0,2020-08-17,outdoor,"Even after playing outdoors a lot, there seems to be very minimal wear and tear."
9816,215,6,3,2020-08-17,width,The width is regular.
9817,215,6,3,2020-08-17,size,I went true to size and was perfectly fine as a slightly wide-footer.
9818,216,176,8.8,2020-11-25,expert_overall,"The Adidas Pro Boost Low is now my go-to hoop shoe for 2020. The traction, cushion, and fit are topped by none. I couldn't think of a bad thing about this shoe."
9819,216,293,8.4,2020-09-07,expert_overall,"Nothing stood out too much on the Adidas Pro Boost Low for me, but it performs like a beast. They were great in every category. If you're looking for a supportive, minimal shoe that you don't have to worry about than these are it. I'd 100% recommend these."
9820,216,6,8.0,2020-08-17,expert_overall,"At $110, the Adidas Pro Boost Low is definitely a good deal. I didn't expect a firm, responsive cushion setup out of these, but it wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Overall these have you covered if you want to feel light on your feet and quick."
9821,216,588,8.1,2022-03-12,user_overall,"This is a great outdoor shoe and has good durability that will last you a while. Some of the herringbone went away slightly on rough outdoor surfaces but traction doesn’t suffer. Indoors traction was decent, but needs constant wiping on dust. The lockdown and fit was very snug, keeping my foot locked down, keep in mind these are not very breathable if at all. The cushioning is incredibly responsive and is firm at times, but breaks in to have some compression."
9822,216,589,7.8,2022-04-03,user_overall,This is a great shoe to wear to hoop outdoors. The traction takes some time to break in indoors and isn't that great on dust. No issues on a clean court. The cushion is very lackluster. You'd expect BOOST x Lightstrike to be extremely comfortable but it's super responsive. Materials are not that breathable. Support was good. Overall a good shoe outdoors but not that great indoors.

9826,216,176,9.5,2020-11-25,traction,The full herringbone pattern through the middle of the outsole worked as well as any shoe I own. I had to do some slight wiping every third game and I was good to go.
9827,216,293,8.0,2020-09-07,traction,They use full herringbone traction here and I found that they had a very good bite on an outdoor court. I didn't get to try them indoors and am not sure how they perform on dust.
9828,216,6,8.0,2020-08-17,traction,"The herringbone traction is pretty good, but you won't stop on a dime. I had no problems on clean courts but you'll need to wipe a lot on dusty courts."
9829,216,176,9.5,2020-11-25,cushion,This cushion felt fantastic underfoot with a combo of Lightstrike and BOOST. This might have been my favorite cushion setup from Adidas in a while.
9830,216,293,8.0,2020-09-07,cushion,"You would think the cushion would be very nice in these, but it wasn't. Court feel is insane, but you don't feel a lot of compression from the Boost. This is a mostly responsive cushion setup with decent impact protection."
9831,216,6,7.0,2020-08-17,cushion,I expected the combination of Lightstrike and Boost to be awesome but it's just not the case. This cushion setup feels pretty firm and responsive with a lot of court feel but I expected more impact protection.
9832,216,176,7.0,2020-11-25,materials,"These materials are pretty standard except that there is no fuse around the upper. The upper didn't stretch all, so the fit won't change as they break-in."
9833,216,293,8.0,2020-09-07,materials,"The materials are pretty thin, light and conform to your foot very well. I really liked the elastic band underneath the tongue as well."
9834,216,6,8.0,2020-08-17,materials,The materials are pretty nice considering the affordable price point. They give the shoe good structure and get the job done performance-wise.
9835,216,176,9.0,2020-11-25,support,The wide base and angled flare provide a lot of stability. The Lightstrike kept my foot secure in the shoe without being bulky. These also have great arch support and stiffness in the midfoot with true ankle support.
9836,216,293,9.0,2020-09-07,support,I had absolutely zero issues with the support. I was surprised how locked in and supported I felt in these. The wide base really helps with stability on lateral movements.
9837,216,6,9.0,2020-08-17,support,I felt perfectly contained in this shoe. Lateral stability and containment are good and you'll have no torsional or rigidity issues. The elastic band under the tongue really helps you lock in when combined with the laces.
9838,216,176,9.0,2020-11-25,fit,There was no movement in the midfoot thanks to the excellent lockdown provided by the lacing system and the strong elastic band.
9839,216,293,9.0,2020-09-07,fit,"A tiny bit long, but overall a very snug fit which is how I like my shoes. The shoe stayed conformed to my foot and snug even after breaking in. I really liked the fit."
9840,216,6,8.0,2020-08-17,fit,There is no dead space in the toe box and I found the fit to be really unique on these. It's like a one booty upper and it feels pretty good.
9841,216,293,100.0,2020-09-07,outdoor,The outsole looks really durable after playing outdoors.
9842,216,6,3,2020-08-17,width,Width was good for me after sizing down half a size. Maybe go true to size if you have really wide feet.
9843,216,293,3,2020-09-07,size,True to size worked well for me and provided a snug fit.
9844,216,6,4,2020-08-17,size,I recommend going down half a size.
9845,217,293,7.0,2020-09-01,expert_overall,"Don't get it! My feet hurt a lot because of the super minimal cushioning. The traction isn't good, the materials are meh and you can get much better shoes - even at a budget price of $100."
9846,217,33,7.0,2020-09-01,expert_overall,"I didn't get to play in these and I do like the design and the colorways, but for only $10 more you can get the PG4 with a much better cushioning and more premium materials."
9847,217,214,7.4,2023-05-25,user_overall,"Similar to the Mamba Focus, this shoe is not premium in any way, but is still not a bad shoe. I did think these were a slight downgrade from the Focus. The shoe felt overall less flexible in the cushioning and upper. The TPU pull tab was a neat edition. Lockdown is still good, and they kept the forefoot outrigger from the Focus. Similarly, they stuck with the gum stick forefoot zoom unit. Still surprising to me how easy it is to get vertical in these. Replacing the stock insole goes a long way."

9850,217,293,6.0,2020-09-01,traction,"On an outdoor court, the traction wasn't good on really hard lateral cuts. The pattern is the same as on the Mamba Focus, which had horrendous traction on my indoor court."
9851,217,293,6.0,2020-09-01,cushion,The cushion is absolutely horrendous. The very stiff Phylon doesn't provide any impact protection at all. The only good thing is that you get a lot of court feel.
9852,217,33,7.0,2020-09-01,cushion,The Phylon cushioning doesn't feel great underfoot and I really don't like the tiny Nike Zoom rectangle in the forefoot.
9853,217,293,8.0,2020-09-01,materials,"The textile upper material conforms to your feet very well and offers a lot of support. The tongue is made of a well-ventilated Mesh but the padding is very minimal. For $100, you can't complain about the materials, but they are not super nice."
9854,217,33,7.0,2020-09-01,materials,The materials are super basic but should get the job done.
9855,217,293,8.0,2020-09-01,support,No issues with the support and lockdown. Lateral containment and stability are good thanks to the sharp outrigger.
9856,217,293,7.0,2020-09-01,fit,The materials are thin and minimally padded. The fit is super narrow and my feet fell asleep multiple times.
9857,217,293,50.0,2020-09-01,outdoor,The rubber doesn't seem to be super durable as some of the pattern is fraying off. But that's pretty much normal wear and tear you experience on outdoor courts.
9858,218,6,8.8,2020-09-09,expert_overall,"The Jordan React Elevation was a great pickup for $120. They were very, very fun to play in and I highly recommend them."
9859,218,293,8.6,2020-09-07,expert_overall,These were a solid performer at a very good price. My favorite part was the cushion and overall the Jordan React Elevation performed well in every category. Pretty much every position can play in this shoe.
9860,218,396,8.6,2021-11-09,user_overall,"My personal uprgade over Diamond Mid. Comfy, no real break-in was required, Bouncy and offer protection, however, feel a bit stiff in the beginning. Gorgeous shoes overall. Traction is the biggest problem, picks dust quickly, require wiping. I wanted to use them outdoors but it seems that the translucent parts of the outsole won't hold up. Lacing system is a bit weird."
9861,218,196,8.8,2022-02-02,user_overall,"One of my favorite shoes. If only upper materials were better quality, it would have been crazy."

9866,218,293,9.0,2020-09-07,traction,"The traction on the decoupled outsole was really, really good on an outdoor court. I didn't get to try these on an indoor court, but I tried them on my wood floors and I think they'll have great bite indoors."
9867,218,6,9.0,2020-09-09,cushion,The React in the heel felt really nice and the forefoot Zoom unit was bouncy with good impact protection. The combo of these two felt great and I enjoyed this cushion setup.
9868,218,293,10.0,2020-09-07,cushion,The cushion felt really nice and there was surprisingly good court feel. These were really good for impact protection and the forefoot Zoom unit was super bouncy. I really liked this cushion setup.
9869,218,6,8.0,2020-09-09,materials,"The materials are okay. They aren't the most premium, but they get the job done just fine."
9870,218,293,8.0,2020-09-07,materials,"The textile material on the upper was a little stiff, but felt supportive. The materials were also surprisingly very minimal and thin."
9871,218,6,9.0,2020-09-09,support,"The support was good on these. I felt really supported and had no instabilities while playing. If these are supportive enough for Luka Doncic, then I think they will hold up well for you."
9872,218,293,8.0,2020-09-07,support,"The lateral containment and stability were really good. Very little ankle support, but I felt slightly restricted because it does come up slightly up to my ankle. Support and lockdown was not an issue at all."
9873,218,6,9.0,2020-09-09,fit,The materials felt nice wrapped around my foot and overall the fit was really good. I really liked the material on the tongue that holds it in place. Nice touch by Jordan brand.
9874,218,293,8.0,2020-09-07,fit,"The toe box was nice and snug, plus the materials didn't stretch out at all. These were easy to put on as well."

9878,219,33,8.9,2020-08-26,expert_overall,"Overall the Nike Zoom BB NXT is a fun shoe to play in with fantastic traction and cushion! They aren't perfect, but its a good improvement step for Nike and a refreshing change of pace. I do wish they had been able to fix the lateral Zoom Air and lacing cable issues prior to releasing."
9879,219,293,8.4,2020-08-04,expert_overall,"Almost everything about this shoe is awesome: the traction, the heel-to-toe-transition, the materials. But Nike just did too much with the React cushioning - it's super soft and comfortable but I didn't feel secure on lateral cuts because the midsole is so thick and unstable."
9880,219,6,8.4,2020-08-03,expert_overall,The Nike Air Zoom BB NXT is a very comfortable shoe with interesting new tech. The cushioning is insane and I really liked the traction too. The only downsides are the lacking stability on lateral cuts and the hefty retail price of $180.
9881,219,32,8.0,2020-07-22,expert_overall,"The Nike Air Zoom BB NXT is an above-average sneaker that is very comfortable and features awesome cushioning and traction. Materials and lockdown are solid but stability is an issue. Overall, a good pick for big hoopers looking for a lot of impact protection, but at a price of $180, there are better and more affordable options on the market."
9882,219,2,8.0,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom BB NXT has an amazing cushion setup that feels plush and bouncy. It's a great all-around sneaker to hoop in, and it truly reminds me of the early setups of the Hyperdunk."
9883,219,455,8.6,2022-02-09,user_overall,"Great shoe with great cushioning, but at a price. It’s super high off the ground, so if you roll your ankle, shits gonna hurt. Happened to me and now I’m out for 2 weeks. Traction is solid, very squeaky, support is decent, and comfort is also quite mediocre. I would recommend these for heavier players who need the cushioning."
9884,219,361,8.6,2022-01-19,user_overall,"This is a pretty good shoe overall. The midsole is very comfortable with the double stacked React, is very comfortable and bouncy, but VERY unstable which is a flaw that’s hard to ignore for some. But that did not stop me from having fun in these!"

9888,219,33,9.5,2020-08-26,traction,"The traction on the Zoom BB NXT is beastly! I've only played outdoors so far, but I would expect them to be outstanding indoors as well."
9889,219,293,9.0,2020-08-04,traction,"I was only able to play outdoors, but the first impression from testing on my wooden floor looks like these will have an incredible bite. On an outdoor court, the bite was also really good."
9890,219,6,10.0,2020-08-03,traction,"The traction setup on this shoe is insane and the bite is ridiculous! On dusty courts, you will have to wipe the dust off the tacky rubber occasionally."
9891,219,32,10.0,2020-07-22,traction,The multidirectional rubber outsole provides phenomenal traction and is very durable. I was able to stop on a dime in every direction.
9892,219,2,8.0,2021-05-06,traction,"The traction reminds me of the LeBron 17 as they use similar groove patterns. Dust pickup was not a problem, and the grip was impressive."
9893,219,33,10.0,2020-08-26,cushion,"This cushion featuring triple-layer React, the third layer being the insole, is just as good as it sounds. These ride really high off the ground which definitely takes some time to get used to, but you're getting a ton of cushion throughout your whole foot. The only drawback is that the cushion is somewhat unstable in the forefoot area on certain movements."
9894,219,293,9.0,2020-08-04,cushion,The cushioning is insane - I love it soo much! The double-stacked React in the heel offers crazy compression and is soft and bouncy. The only downside is the very bad court feel as the cushioning is super high-off-the-ground.
9895,219,6,9.0,2020-08-03,cushion,"The full-length React midsole featuring two Zoom units in the forefoot is super, super comfortable, and provides a ton of impact protection. And even though you are really high off-the-ground, the shoe still feels relatively responsive and offers a decent amount of court feel."
9896,219,32,9.0,2020-07-22,cushion,"The cushioning is crazy comfortable and offers a ton of impact protection. Unfortunately, the super thick and high-off-the-ground midsole takes away from stability on lateral cuts."
9897,219,2,9.0,2021-05-06,cushion,The shoe has three layers of React cushioning and two Zoom pods located under the forefoot. It is an extremely comfortable setup.
9898,219,33,9.0,2020-08-26,materials,"These materials have a textile upper which is comfortable, easily breaks in, and is pretty durable. They work well, but aren't anything special. It would've been nice to see some more premium materials given the price."
9899,219,293,9.0,2020-08-04,materials,"The mesh/textile materials are surprisingly thin, soft, and durable. The tongue and Achilles area are nicely padded and very comfortable."
9900,219,6,8.0,2020-08-03,materials,"The textile materials are supportive and feel nice on foot. Overall, the materials could be a little more premium, especially compared to other shoes in this price range."
9901,219,32,7.0,2020-07-22,materials,"The upper is made from lightweight Mesh which provides a lot of stability and the foam tongue feels very comfortable and plush. The quality is a little sub-par as the materials are thick, not breathable, and feel a little excessive."
9902,219,2,8.0,2021-05-06,materials,The entire upper is made of mesh. It's much softer compared to other meshes on the market and feels very premium.
9903,219,33,7.0,2020-08-26,support,"The support in general is solid, but the lateral Zoom Air unit lacks stability and can cause some issues at times. The moderator plate works great for cushion and torsion. The internal heel counter works well too and I had no issues there."
9904,219,293,6.0,2020-08-04,support,"My foot was locked in on the footbed and I had no issues with containment. I didn't roll my ankle, but I felt uncomfortable on lateral cuts because this shoe is pretty unstable due to the soft and high midsole."
9905,219,6,7.0,2020-08-03,support,"I felt some instabilities on lateral cuts because the cushioning is so high off-the-ground. Other than that, the heel was locked down, the torsional rigidity was good and I didn't slip on the footbed."
9906,219,32,7.0,2020-07-22,support,"The lacing system really locks down your feet and keeps them in place safely. However, the shoe is very unstable on lateral cuts because it is so high off-the-ground."
9907,219,2,7.0,2021-05-06,support,"I wish they added more heel padding to help secure the ankle, but the heel counter and lacing tightly help to alleviate that. It also has a wide base that helps you feel stable."
9908,219,33,9.0,2020-08-26,fit,Lockdown was solid and the shoes fit like a glove. The nylon lace cable does chafe my pinky toes which was pretty annoying.
9909,219,293,9.0,2020-08-04,fit,Super easy to put on with a nice one-to-one fit.  The toe box was snug initially but broke in after a few wears.
9910,219,6,8.0,2020-08-03,fit,"Overall the fit is really good, but there is some slight rubbing on the side of the foot at times."
9911,219,32,9.0,2020-07-22,fit,The fit wraps around your foot and is extremely comfortable.
9912,219,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,"There is a bit of extra space in the front of the shoe by the toes, but otherwise, it fits decently."
9913,219,293,0.0,2020-08-04,outdoor,The rubber is not durable enough for extended outdoor play.
9914,219,2,50.0,2021-05-06,outdoor,The rubber is hard. The grooves are also deep and thick.

9921,220,293,8.4,2020-07-31,expert_overall,Overall the HOVR Havoc 3 was a solid performer for $110! It was great in pretty much all categories and didn't have any real low points.

9925,220,293,9.0,2020-07-31,traction,"I only got to test these outdoors, and the performance there was really good. On my wood floors inside they had a good bite too. They might pick up some dust because of the traction pattern."
9926,220,6,8.0,2020-07-22,cushion,"This HOVR cushion setup performs similarly to other models using this tech. It is very responsive with nice court feel, but the impact protection isn't the most forgiving. Definitely catered more towards guards."
9927,220,293,7.0,2020-07-31,cushion,"The cushion was pretty good initially, but once I started playing hard my feet began to hurt. The court feel is really good, but the impact protection is lacking."
9928,220,6,7.0,2020-07-22,materials,"The textile mesh upper is very thin and covered in fuse which doesn't feel great to the touch, but worked just fine. Although these materials weren't the most premium, the performance was fine."
9929,220,293,8.0,2020-07-31,materials,"Under Armour used a mesh material that is fused up pretty well and I liked it. It is supportive yet thin enough to conform to my foot. Quality-wise the materials aren't the best, but on-foot they are very, very nice."
9930,220,6,9.0,2020-07-22,support,The internal heel counter and sculpting kept my heel locked in. I had no side to side movement on the footbed and felt very stable thanks to the wide base.
9931,220,293,9.0,2020-07-31,support,"I had no issues with lateral containment and my heel felt locked in. The materials don't stretch, so they held my foot in place very well. The low, wide base made for great lateral stability too."

9935,220,293,2,2020-07-31,width,If you have a wide foot or like a slightly loose fit I'd suggest going up half a size.

9938,221,6,8.4,2020-08-02,expert_overall,"For $160, this is not the best shoe in this price range. But if you are a fan of a more responsive Boost cushioning or you can find this shoe on a discount - I would highly recommend it. This is a great performer and one of the best team models Adidas has put on the market in a while."
9939,221,2,8.2,2021-05-06,expert_overall,I really like how the BYW 2.0 plays. It's low to the ground and still has impact protection because of the Boost. It's also well-ventilated and very stable.

9946,221,2,9.0,2021-05-06,traction,The rubber compound is much harder this time around. The herringbone pattern also performs well on both clean and dusty courts.
9947,221,293,10.0,2020-06-19,cushion,The full-length Boost midsole is heavily caged but feels incredible. Reminds me a little of the Harden Vol.3. Checks off everything I want about a cushioning setup.
9948,221,6,9.0,2020-08-02,cushion,The full-length Boost cushioning is partly caged and is a really good balance of court feel/responsiveness and impact protection.
9949,221,2,8.0,2021-05-06,cushion,There is full-length Boost caged within a Phylon-like material. The Boost is thin at the forefoot and more chunky in the heel. It reminds me of the Marquee Boost.
9950,221,293,8.0,2020-06-19,materials,"For a $160 shoe, these are not the materials you want to see. The Mesh upper is thin, soft, and gets the job done, but feels a little cheap in-hand."
9951,221,6,8.0,2020-08-02,materials,The textile and mesh upper with different synthetic/felt overlays is not exactly premium but gets the job done just fine.
9952,221,2,8.0,2021-05-06,materials,"It has a plastic-like feeling, but it is very durable and supportive."
9953,221,293,9.0,2020-06-19,support,I felt laterally contained thanks to the wide and stable base. No issues at all with support and lockdown.
9954,221,6,8.0,2020-08-02,support,"No heel slippage and no side-to-side movements on the footbed. The wide base adds to the stability, and the plastic shank helps with the torsional rigidity."
9955,221,2,8.0,2021-05-06,support,"When laced up, the shoe provides great lateral support because of the plastic cage surrounding the midfoot. It is a bit slippery around the heel area."

9957,221,6,8.0,2020-08-02,fit,I didn't have any dead space in the toe area and the materials conformed to my feet really nicely.
9958,221,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,The shoe fits a little bit big if you have a regular foot shape.
9959,221,293,50.0,2020-06-19,outdoor,The rubber is super soft and tears off quickly if you play outdoors.
9960,221,2,100.0,2021-05-06,outdoor,The rubber compound is very durable.
9961,221,6,3,2020-08-02,width,Even if you are a wide-footer going down half a size should be okay.
9962,221,2,3,2021-05-06,width,Fairly wide in the forefoot area. They are wide footer friendly.
9963,221,6,4,2020-08-02,size,Going down half a size is your best bet.

9966,222,293,8.2,2020-06-19,expert_overall,"For $100, the Jordan Westbrook One Take is incredible. If the traction held up better, it'd be amazing. That's my only gripe. The cushion was great for a budget model. I felt fast and responsive. The materials feel nice, and the support is there. There isn't much this shoe is missing."
9967,222,327,8.5,2022-01-23,user_overall,"Had this shoe, until it was too small I think, I've used it for around 7-8 months, I still have it now (it's still in REALLY good shape), well worth the money, it has superb ventilation. Really good traction (it can pick up dust over a long time), and support plus It has the best material for its price."
9968,222,600,6.9,2022-10-23,user_overall,A very tight shoe for people with wide feet. This shoe may have decent materials but is extremely heavy and hard to play in properly. I would recommend this shoe for hard play but not for games

9972,222,2,9.0,2021-05-06,traction,"I was really impressed with the traction. The pattern is well-spaced, so it didn't pick up much dust when I played on dirtier courts. It also had a gnarly bite."
9973,222,293,8.0,2020-06-19,traction,"On indoor surface materials like wood, it bites really well."
9974,222,2,8.0,2021-05-06,cushion,There is a small Zoom unit in the One Take that provides bounce right under the ball of your foot. It's low to the ground and responsive.
9975,222,293,9.0,2020-06-19,cushion,"The cushion is one of my favourite parts of the shoe. There is a good amount of impact protection, and you feel the Zoom unit in the forefoot as soon as you step in the shoe."
9976,222,2,8.0,2021-05-06,materials,"The materials perform well. I didn't think they would, but they held up nicely."
9977,222,293,8.0,2020-06-19,materials,"The material reminds me of Flyknit, but it feels cozy and premium. I really enjoyed playing with these materials."
9978,222,293,8.0,2020-06-19,support,"No issues with support and lockdown. It has a flat and wide base, so there's plenty of lateral stability as well."
9979,222,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,The fit didn't feel too loose or too tight. It was a nice fit overall.
9980,222,293,8.0,2020-06-19,fit,"Length-wise, it's perfect, and the space in the toe box is snug. It stretches out a little bit over time, but not much."
9981,222,2,50.0,2021-05-06,outdoor,The rubber compound is durable enough for outdoor use.
9982,222,293,0.0,2020-06-19,outdoor,There is a lot of fraying on the rubber from outdoor use. The rubber is too soft to be durable.
9983,222,293,2,2020-06-19,width,"Width-wise, the shoe is narrower than normal."
9984,222,293,3,2020-06-19,size,"I went true to size, and it fit very well."
9985,223,293,8.2,2020-08-02,expert_overall,"The Converse G4 are good performers that I enjoyed playing in. Personally they weren't as fluid or smooth as I would have liked, but I feel like all players can play in this shoe."
9986,223,6,8.2,2020-08-02,expert_overall,For $120 I would say the Converse G4 is a pretty good shoe. You get a unique shoe that performs well overall and I don't think you'll be disappointed unless you need a lot of impact protection.
9987,223,293,8.0,2020-08-02,traction,The waffle traction pattern worked well on an outdoor court. There was a good bite when I tried them on my wood floors indoors too. These don't seem like they'll pick up a lot of dust because the grooves are spaced out well.
9988,223,6,8.0,2020-08-02,traction,"This multidirectional traction pattern is actually pretty good. If you guys are playing on clean courts you shouldn't have any problems, but dust might cause you to slide a little bit. They don't pick up that much dust and it is easy to wipe off. Overall I was pretty satisfied with traction."
9989,223,293,9.0,2020-08-02,cushion,The cushioning is probably one of my favorite parts of the shoe. They are using a React midsole and a forefoot Zoom unit that feels good. The forefoot is bouncy and the heel has some nice compression. The React used here is definitely stiffer than React in Nike's running shoes. This is a very responsive cushion setup with decent impact protection.
9990,223,6,8.0,2020-08-02,cushion,"The React midsole and forefoot Zoom unit don't feel like cushioning from a React lifestyle shoe. It is more firm and you can tell it is more geared towards performance basketball. You get a very light bounce and some impact protection, but a lot of court feel and responsiveness. This cushion is more catered towards guard style players."
9991,223,293,8.0,2020-08-02,materials,"The entire upper is made of a ballistic nylon material that I really like because it is so supportive. It does not stretch at all, but it is thin and conforms to your foot pretty well. Quality overall is okay and feels good on foot."
9992,223,6,9.0,2020-08-02,materials,The materials used here are really good. The upper is a ballistic mesh material that is very structured and feels nice on foot. This mesh provides great structure and support which is awesome because this is a very low cut sneaker. There are some plastic overlays around high wear areas which will definitely help with durability.
9993,223,293,8.0,2020-08-02,support,"As far as support and lockdown goes, I had no issues. The lateral containment was good and the internal TPU heel counter worked well. Lateral stability was good even with no outrigger because the shoe is pretty wide."
9994,223,6,9.0,2020-08-02,support,"I had no issues with the support here. I had some heel slippage at first in one shoe, but it went away as I played more. The internal heel counter provides lockdown and there was no side to side movement on the footbed. The base is pretty wide as well which helps with stability. Even though these are low cut, the support was really nice."
9995,223,293,8.0,2020-08-02,fit,"Even going down half a size these still were a little long for me. The lateral side had a plastic fuse piece that was hurting the side of my pinky toe even when my laces were loose. It is snug in the toe box area, but overall I really liked it. These are great if you have a narrow foot."
9996,223,6,7.0,2020-08-02,fit,These fit slightly long and narrow and caused some pain on the sides of my foot where my pinky toe is. There is no dead space in the toe box area and the tongue fits nicely over your feet.
9997,223,293,50.0,2020-08-02,outdoor,"Durability seems okay and the rubber is really hard in the middle of the outsole, but the perimeter is fraying."
9998,223,6,2,2020-08-02,width,As a slightly wide footer I definitely felt some pain in the forefoot area. I'd say go up half a size.
9999,223,6,3,2020-08-02,size,These are pretty true to size and maybe a tad bit long.
10000,224,32,9.0,2020-04-17,expert_overall,"The performance is off the charts: cushioning is awesome and traction is good too. The materials could have been a little bit more premium and supportive. Overall, the KD 13 is very similar to the KD12 and a phenomenal performance hoop shoe."
10001,224,6,8.8,2020-07-13,expert_overall,"The KD 13 is a great performer! The materials are just okay, but everything else is really solid."
10002,224,45,8.8,2020-08-10,expert_overall,"We'll say it again... arguably the greatest cushioning setup we've tested at PureKicks! Overall, this is the greatest out of box experience we've ever had. Don't miss out and make sure you cop these!"
10003,224,2,8.8,2021-05-07,expert_overall,The Nike KD 13 improves on the KD 12 by improving stability and cushioning. It's one of my top shoes for 2020 and really has no flaws.
10004,224,293,8.6,2020-06-04,expert_overall,"I love this shoe! Traction seemed good, cushioning is incredible and the fit was perfect for me"
10005,224,33,8.5,2020-07-23,expert_overall,"I really enjoy the Nike KD 13, but they’re not perfect. Cushioning and traction are awesome but containment and stability leave a bit to be desired."
10006,224,317,8.6,2021-12-24,user_overall,"The traction and the cushion is really great, the shoe is a bit hard to put on but after that it has a great fit. The materials are amazing but they do exactly what they are supposed to do. It is kinda bulky/heavy, so keep that in mind. Overall it is a really good shoe for any position, even someone like me who likes low shoes more loves it."

10011,224,32,9.0,2020-04-17,traction,The mix of circular and horizontal lines give you multidirectional traction. The grip is on-point whether you play outdoors or indoors.
10012,224,6,9.0,2020-07-13,traction,The circular traction pattern performs really nicely. It sticks like glue and picks up very little dust.
10013,224,45,9.0,2020-08-10,traction,This traction did what it was supposed to do with a great bite and coverage. It also didn't collect any dust at all.
10014,224,2,9.0,2021-05-07,traction,The traction grips hard and picks up basically no dust. It performs excellently.
10015,224,293,9.0,2020-06-04,traction,The traction seems to be really good but I wasn't able to test them on an indoor court.
10016,224,33,9.5,2020-07-23,traction,The nubs and circular cups of the traction pattern work in every direction you’re moving or stopping.
10017,224,32,10.0,2020-04-17,cushion,"Full-length Zoom cushioning with an additional Zoom Air unit in the forefoot. Like we are used to from the KD line, this is one of the best cushioning setups out there!"
10018,224,6,10.0,2020-07-13,cushion,The full-length Zoom Air gives you great responsiveness and court feel while also providing good impact protection. This is probably my favorite cushioning setup right now.
10019,224,45,10.0,2020-08-10,cushion,"The cushioning is no joke! Nike came through with double stacked Zoom and this is arguably the greatest cushion setup we have ever tested. The impact protection is outer wordly, the response is stupid, and the court feel is mad!"
10020,224,2,10.0,2021-05-07,cushion,"I'm in love with the full-length Zoom Strobel. You ride just close enough to the ground, but still, it feels bouncy. It's the best cushion on the market right now."
10021,224,293,9.0,2020-06-04,cushion,"The full-length Zoom Strobel is pretty damn nice. Impact protection is good, there is a lot of bounce and the court feel is decent too."
10022,224,33,10.0,2020-07-23,cushion,"The full-length Zoom Air feels springy but smooth at the same time. Every time I put them on, I’m always surprised by how damn comfortable they are."
10023,224,32,8.0,2020-04-17,materials,"The combination of Mesh and textile materials feels a lot lighter than the KD 12, but unfortunately, also a little cheaper and less premium. But they definitely get the job done."
10024,224,6,7.0,2020-07-13,materials,The textile materials are a downgrade from the KD12 but they get the job done.
10025,224,45,8.0,2020-08-10,materials,"The materials on the KD 13 consist of a soft upper constructed from minimal materials that feels broken in from the start. Breathability isn't great though and this shoe was pretty hot to hoop in. Overall, the materials are comfortable and this shoe in general screams comfort!"
10026,224,2,8.0,2021-05-07,materials,"It features a ripstop mesh-like upper. It looks nice visually and allows for a lot of different prints. In terms of performance, it is very dependable. I love the feel of them."
10027,224,293,8.0,2020-06-04,materials,The quality of the textile used in the upper feels a little cheap but works well on-foot. The padding on the tongue and heel is very comfortable.
10028,224,33,7.0,2020-07-23,materials,Textiles and ripstop style materials are used and it’s just not impressive at all.
10029,224,32,8.0,2020-04-17,support,"The removal of Flywire and the more minimal upper mean that there is less support than in the KD 12, but I never had any issues playing defense or doing crossovers."
10030,224,6,9.0,2020-07-13,support,"The support was amazing, with no heel slippage or side-to-side movement."
10031,224,45,9.0,2020-08-10,support,"Great lockdown from the fit with an internal heel counter and external heel clip. The outrigger of the shoe, the clip near the front toe, plus the lacewing help with lateral movements. Overall great support in the KD 13."
10032,224,2,9.0,2021-05-07,support,"There is no problem with lockdown, the heel containment is awesome, and there is no slippage. I felt very stable and secure."
10033,224,293,8.0,2020-06-04,support,The flat base and rubber on the lateral side of the shoe provide a lot of stability on cuts. The internal TPU heel counter prevented any heel slippage.
10034,224,33,7.0,2020-07-23,support,My feet would occasionally slide over the footbed because of the lack of a forefoot outrigger or containment cage.
10035,224,32,8.0,2020-04-17,fit,The fit is not insanely comfortable but that doesn't hinder the performance at all!
10036,224,6,9.0,2020-07-13,fit,I had no dead space in the toe box and the fit was pretty close to 1:1.
10037,224,45,8.0,2020-08-10,fit,The KD 13 is what we've come to expect fit wise from the KD line which is pretty narrow. The lacing system and half booty construction are great for creating that locked-in feeling.
10038,224,2,8.0,2021-05-07,fit,It fits my foot very well as a regular footer.
10039,224,293,9.0,2020-06-04,fit,The KD 13 is very comfortable and needs no break-in time at all.
10040,224,33,9.0,2020-07-23,fit,"The KD 13 locks you in perfectly without any pain, pinching, or restriction."
10041,224,45,50.0,2020-08-10,outdoor,"The durability was okay, but it would probably be best not to play outdoors all the time in the KD 13. The Nike ID does have an XDR option for outdoor hoopers."
10042,224,2,100.0,2021-05-07,outdoor,"It's made of hard rubber, so it should be dependable outdoors."
10043,224,293,50.0,2020-06-04,outdoor,The rubber is pretty thick and durable.
10044,224,6,2,2020-07-13,width,The KD13 runs narrow.
10045,224,45,1,2020-08-10,width,
10046,224,2,3,2021-05-07,width,It is not as narrow as the KD 12.
10047,224,293,2,2020-06-04,width,Runs pretty narrow and there's not a lot of toe space.
10048,224,6,4,2020-07-13,size,Runs a little bit long.
10049,224,2,3,2021-05-07,size,I was able to go true to size with regular foot size.
10050,224,293,3,2020-06-04,size,"If you are a wide-footer go up half a size, otherwise go true to size."
10051,225,6,8.4,2020-07-22,expert_overall,"For only $90 retail, this is a really nice shoe. The cushion setup is great and traction works really well. Overall, the KD Trey 5 VIII doesn't feel like a budget model at all - I'd highly recommend picking these up if you're interested in them."
10052,225,293,8.0,2020-07-22,expert_overall,"For $90 this has to be one of the best budget shoes I have tried. The KD Trey 5 VII is super light and minimal and you feel very quick playing in these. This shoe doesn't feel cheap and the only downside for me was the support. Overall, a great shoe for the price and should work well for players who want to hoop outdoors."
10053,225,607,8.7,2022-10-19,user_overall,"Shoe traction was incredible, squeeky and sticky. Cushion very soft and I would say bouncy. Upper materials was very good quality, but it does not support your foot. It is easy to break your ankle, but shoe overall I would say the best I got, everyone should love this shoe, so comfortable, I am coming back to this shoe everytime"
10054,225,525,9.4,2022-03-12,user_overall,This is a great shoe but it needs improvements like the cushion could be more comfortable and and the material could be a bit more breathable. But on the upside this shoe plays very well and I would not sleep on purchasing this shoe. It has great grip and it locks you in when you are hooping. So overall I would buy this shoe
10055,225,422,9.0,2023-05-10,user_overall,"I liked this shoe a lot. Had really good traction during the season. Great shoe if you don’t play the whole game. And is a great shoe for the price. The only negative thang I’d have to say about it is, they  lose there traction after using them for a while."
10056,225,479,7.8,2021-12-12,user_overall,I've had this shoe for a long time and mostly have played with it outdoors. It gives you a great bang for your buck and great longevity.
10057,225,608,9.4,2023-07-02,user_overall,This is my first basketball shoe so I will be a bit bias but this was a great shoe for me when I play outdoor with my friends.
10058,225,6,9.0,2020-07-22,traction,The modified herringbone traction on the KD Trey 5 VIII is great on clean courts and you should be good on dustier courts as well because these don't pick up a lot of dust.
10059,225,293,8.0,2020-07-22,traction,I only played outdoors in these but the traction worked well because similar to other budget shoes these use very hard rubber. The performance should be good indoors looking at the traction pattern and it worked well when I tried them on my wood floors at home.
10060,225,6,9.0,2020-07-22,cushion,"The cushion here uses dual-density Renew foam and it's very mushy, plush, and comfortable! There is not a lot of court feel but the impact protection is great which really helps if you want to use these outdoors. Overall a very comfortable cushion setup."
10061,225,293,9.0,2020-07-22,cushion,"The full-length Nike Renew cushioning is really good but does bottom out a bit. The impact protection is great and you still have really good court feel. If you like a responsive, low-to-the-ground cushion setup with some impact protection and a little bounce these will be perfect for you."
10062,225,6,9.0,2020-07-22,materials,The materials are different from the last Trey 5 and feature a very nice knit for the upper which feels surprisingly premium considering the price point. There are various overlays around the shoe to help with durability too. Overall really nice materials!
10063,225,293,9.0,2020-07-22,materials,The materials feature a thin knit material on the upper which feels very minimal on foot. It conforms to your foot nicely and there is a little bit of stretch in the knit. They are really comfortable on foot and feel okay around the ankle and tongue. The materials are surprisingly nice for $90!
10064,225,6,7.0,2020-07-22,support,"I think the support is an upgrade over the last Trey 5. The internal heel counter held in my heel well and I didn't have too much heel slippage. Due to the upper materials used, I could definitely feel my foot rolling over the footbed a bit. Otherwise torsional rigidity and stability are fine."
10065,225,293,6.0,2020-07-22,support,"The support and lockdown wasn't that great for me because I could feel my foot wanting to slide out of the side of the shoe. There isn't a ton of caging to help with lateral movements and I definitely felt it. Ankle support wasn't great because this shoe doesn't come up very high, but lateral stability was pretty good and I didn't have any issues there."
10066,225,6,8.0,2020-07-22,fit,There is a little bit of dead space in the toe as with most KD models but overall the fit is great.
10067,225,293,8.0,2020-07-22,fit,These fit my feet pretty well and they stretch out a bit as you break them in.
10068,225,6,100.0,2020-07-22,outdoor,The rubber on this traction pattern is pretty durable and I had no problem with these outdoors.
10069,225,293,100.0,2020-07-22,outdoor,These feature really hard durable rubber and should be good for outdoor use.
10070,225,293,2,2020-07-22,width,I'd recommend going up half or even a whole size on these. It would be best to try them on before buying.
10071,225,293,3,2020-07-22,size,"True to size worked for me, but I have a pretty narrow foot."
10072,226,33,8.2,2020-03-07,expert_overall,"Overall, I found that the Nike Adapt BB 2.0 was better than the original Adapt BB, but I still don’t feel that these are necessarily for me."
10073,226,293,8.2,2020-03-03,expert_overall,"Traction, cushioning, support, and fit work well. But the cheap materials, the weight, and the bulkiness made it so that I couldn't enjoy playing in the Adapt BB 2.0."
10074,226,2,8.2,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"The cushion and support are fantastic, but the traction can be inconsistent on dustier courts. Despite this, I still enjoyed playing in the Nike Adapt BB 2.0."
10075,226,6,7.8,2020-02-27,expert_overall,This shoe is nowhere near worth the $400 price tag.
10076,226,609,8.3,2024-07-02,user_overall,It a solid shoe it to heavy for a basketball shoe sometimes it's hard to charge traction is good but takes a lot of dust have to wipe it sometimes.

10080,226,33,7.0,2020-03-07,traction,The herringbone traction pattern works well but the translucent rubber feels too inconsistent.
10081,226,293,9.0,2020-03-03,traction,"The traction is nuts on clean courts, but the translucent rubber picks up some dust on dirty courts."
10082,226,2,8.0,2021-05-06,traction,"On a clean court, the traction is great. On dusty courts, it picks up a lot of dust and causes a little bit of slipping."
10083,226,6,8.0,2020-02-27,traction,"On clean courts, you will have no issues, but the translucent rubber didn't work very well on dusty courts which means you need to wipe consistently."
10084,226,33,9.0,2020-03-07,cushion,"The Zoom Turbo setup is low profile, springy and ultra-responsive."
10085,226,293,8.0,2020-03-03,cushion,The Zoom Turbo has a nice bounce and good impact protection. Court feel isn't great as you feel pretty high off the ground.
10086,226,2,9.0,2021-05-06,cushion,The cushion is the main highlight of the shoe. It reminds me a lot of the Kyrie 6 with the use of Zoom Turbo.
10087,226,6,8.0,2020-02-27,cushion,The full-length Cushlon foam with a Zoom Turbo unit in the forefoot works well but is not as bouncy or responsive as the Zoom Turbo in the Kyrie 6.
10088,226,33,9.0,2020-03-07,materials,"The textiles and TPU materials get the job done, but this shoe is heavy as hell because of the electric components."
10089,226,293,7.0,2020-03-03,materials,"The materials are stiff in the beginning and take one or two days to break in. For $400, the materials feel pretty crappy."
10090,226,2,7.0,2021-05-06,materials,The upper is made of ballistic mesh. It feels like plastic at the start but becomes softer as you play in it.
10091,226,6,7.0,2020-02-27,materials,The plasticky-feeling Mesh materials are very disappointing considering the $400 price point but they get the job done performance-wise.
10092,226,33,9.0,2020-03-07,support,The support was pretty damn good.
10093,226,293,9.0,2020-03-03,support,Lateral containment is great and you feel locked down at all times.
10094,226,2,9.0,2021-05-06,support,"There isn't a lot of stretch in the materials, which helps with support and durability. The lateral support is also good."
10095,226,6,9.0,2020-02-27,support,"The support is really nice thanks to the large heel counter, wide base, and the lacing system that works as a midfoot shank."
10096,226,33,7.0,2020-03-07,fit,I can’t seem to get the shoe tight enough without causing cramping or cutting off circulation in my feet.
10097,226,293,8.0,2020-03-03,fit,"The Fit Adapt system hasn't improved compared to last year, but the system still works well and is super convenient. It can be hard to find the right tightness settings that work best on-court."
10098,226,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,The shoe fits nicely with the automated lace system.
10099,226,6,7.0,2020-02-27,fit,I experienced some pinching pain and cramping because I wasn't able to adjust the lacing to my feet.
10100,226,293,0.0,2020-03-03,outdoor,The rubber is super soft and frays easily - definitely don't play outdoors in these.
10101,226,2,0.0,2021-05-06,outdoor,"The traction has frayed for me and for the price, I wouldn't take these outdoors."
10102,226,293,2,2020-03-03,width,Pretty narrow fit.
10103,226,2,3,2021-05-06,width,"For a better fit, wide footers might want to go up half a size."
10104,226,6,3,2020-02-27,width,Not nearly as narrow as the Adapt Pro BB 1.0.
10105,226,293,3,2020-03-03,size,I went true to size which is pretty snug.
10106,226,2,3,2021-05-06,size,True to size for regular footers and go up half a size for wide footers.
10107,226,6,3,2020-02-27,size,Runs true to size.
10108,227,6,8.4,2020-03-07,expert_overall,$170 is a steep price but I don't think you will be disappointed if you pick up the Lebron 17 Low.
10109,227,293,8.4,2020-03-07,expert_overall,"The traction was really good and the cushioning was pretty damn nice. Overall, the Lebron 17 Low is a solid performer but probably not worth $170, especially considering the cheap upper materials."
10110,227,2,8.4,2021-05-06,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron 17 Low is an impressive performing sneaker. The traction is excellent, and the materials do a good job of helping you feel supportive. The cushion is not as plush as the regular LeBron 17, but they do offer more stability."
10111,227,429,7.8,2022-01-18,user_overall,"Shoes were alright, it's just that FIT. It felt like my feet were bleeding. if you have even regular sized feet, don’t even try it on!! everything else was good. The shoe was very hard to get on, and laces felt like I wasn’t secure. overall ok hoop shoe if you want to get your foot squished like a stress ball."

10115,227,6,8.0,2020-03-07,traction,The traction was pretty good on clean courts and you will need to wipe only occasionally on dusty courts.
10116,227,293,10.0,2020-03-07,traction,I was really impressed! You stop on a dime on lateral cuts and linear movements and the rubber picks up almost no dust.
10117,227,2,9.0,2021-05-06,traction,There is more tread around the forefoot area of the shoe. It grips nicely and gets better the more you play in them.
10118,227,6,8.0,2020-03-07,cushion,The giant Air Max unit in the heel feels a little firmer compared to the Lebron 17 High but still provides you with a lot of impact protection. The React in the forefoot is underwhelming and feels just like generic foam.
10119,227,293,9.0,2020-03-07,cushion,The Air Max cushioning in the heel and the React foam in the forefoot provide you with crazy good impact protection but very little court feel.
10120,227,2,8.0,2021-05-06,cushion,The cushion is a lot stiffer compared to the regular LeBron 17. This offers more stability. The forefoot is also fairly bouncy after breaking them in.
10121,227,6,9.0,2020-03-07,materials,The full-Mesh upper feels pretty nice and should be super durable.
10122,227,293,7.0,2020-03-07,materials,I didn't like the pretty stiff Mesh materials used on the upper.
10123,227,2,9.0,2021-05-06,materials,"The mesh and leather upper do a good job of providing quality performance, especially when it comes to support."
10124,227,6,9.0,2020-03-07,support,Your heel is locked down and you have no side-to-side movement on the footbed.
10125,227,293,8.0,2020-03-07,support,The upper materials are super supportive and provide great containment. The super-soft cushioning is pretty high-off-the-ground and feels a little unstable in the heel.
10126,227,2,8.0,2021-05-06,support,It's a very supportive sneaker. The leather that wraps around the edge helps with lateral support and keeps your foot contained on the foot bed.
10127,227,6,8.0,2020-03-07,fit,"This is probably the hardest shoe to put on I've ever tested. I felt a little pinching pain on the lateral side of the forefoot. Other than that, the fit is really tight and your feet are very well-contained."
10128,227,293,8.0,2020-03-07,fit,The one-bootie upper fit my feet perfectly but it's pretty hard to put on.
10129,227,2,8.0,2021-05-06,fit,"The shoe fits well, but it can get pretty snug in the forefoot area."
10130,227,293,0.0,2020-03-07,outdoor,The rubber is super soft and frays easily - definitely don't play outdoors.
10131,227,2,50.0,2021-05-06,outdoor,The rubber compound is very hard and it has deep grooves.
10132,227,293,2,2020-03-07,width,The overall fit is pretty narrow.
10133,227,2,3,2021-05-06,width,It's better to try it on first if you have a wide foot since the forefoot is pretty snug.
10134,227,293,3,2020-03-07,size,I went true to size and lengthwise I was really good.
10135,227,2,3,2021-05-06,size,"If you have a regular foot, true to size will work for you."
10136,228,293,8.4,2020-06-19,expert_overall,"I was pleasantly surprised. For $100 retail, the Adidas Pro Model 2G performs really well and is a super solid shoe that will work for most player types!"
10137,228,522,8.2,2020-07-14,expert_overall,"The updated version of the classic Pro Model checks all the boxes compared to modern basketball shoes and gives you good traction, fun cushioning, solid support & stability, and a good fit."
10138,228,435,8.0,2022-11-25,user_overall,I slipped in these once indoor so that wasn't great. There is slight heel slippage but it didn't affect me in games. Overall the traction is good but unreliable the durability of these is insane. Both the insole and outsole hold up better than any other trainers.
10139,228,26,7.9,2022-02-28,user_overall,Very nice shoe just needs time to break in. A bit heavy but not bad.

10143,228,293,8.0,2020-06-19,traction,Traction worked well outdoors and when I tried it on my wooden floor it had a really nice bite. I am a little bit worried about dust because of the tightly-spaced traction pattern.
10144,228,522,9.0,2020-07-14,traction,Super sticky when clean or freshly wiped and needs very little wiping on dusty floors
10145,228,293,9.0,2020-06-19,cushion,The full-length Bounce midsole is pretty damn nice. You feel very low-to-the-ground in the forefoot but the heel is very bouncy and provides good impact protection.
10146,228,522,8.0,2020-07-14,cushion,The Bounce cushioning is low-to-the-ground but offers enough feedback and bounce to make the shoe feel fun.
10147,228,293,8.0,2020-06-19,materials,"The materials are built like a tank, this shoe will last forever! Surprisingly comfortable too."
10148,228,522,8.0,2020-07-14,materials,The patent leather takes a little to break-in but once enough creases have formed you will have no issues. The material is not breathable at all.
10149,228,293,8.0,2020-06-19,support,My foot was locked down on lateral movements but I had a little bit of heel slippage.
10150,228,522,8.0,2020-07-14,support,The patent leather and plastic torsion plate provide decent support. The heel could have been a little flatter but overall stability was not an issue.
10151,228,293,9.0,2020-06-19,fit,"Very snug, no dead space in the toe box, overall a great fit for my feet!"
10152,228,522,8.0,2020-07-14,fit,There was zero movement inside the shoe and no heel slip due to the higher cut.
10153,228,293,100.0,2020-06-19,outdoor,The rubber held up really well in outdoor play.
10154,228,522,4,2020-07-14,size,These fit a little long like Adidas shoes typically do.
10155,229,32,9.0,2020-01-03,expert_overall,Everything about this shoe is super solid. If you like the flashy and futuristic design this is a great shoe to pickup!
10156,229,293,8.6,2020-01-03,expert_overall,"The Why Not Zer0.3 is a really good performer. I like it a lot better than the first two models, but I still would have preferred it to be a little lighter and more minimal-feeling."
10157,229,45,8.6,2020-04-01,expert_overall,This is definitely my favorite Westbrook sneaker so far thanks to the amazing Zoom Turbo cushioning and aggressive traction pattern. But the main attraction of the shoe is the deconstructed style that looks amazing!
10158,229,6,8.2,2020-01-14,expert_overall,"The Why Not Zer0.3 is not a terrible performer overall, but the issues with lateral traction are a dealbreaker for me."
10159,229,615,7.8,2020-02-09,expert_overall,If it wasn't for the horrible traction in my colorway I could have seen myself playing a whole lot in the Why Not Zer0.3.
10160,229,616,8.5,2022-03-14,user_overall,"Got them in the SE version, this shoe is very good, amazing cushion, good traction, it's very very light (I wear a 13) and last but not least is very cool in the spruce aura flash crimson colorway, I'm a 16 years old 6'2 X 80 kg guard who does a lot of crossovers and has a good athleticism, they worked for me apart from when i do lateral movement"
10161,229,617,8.4,2022-02-12,user_overall,I wanted a shoe that could lock my foot down and be bouncy at the same time but I found out that this shoe can’t do both. The traction was fine but it had a break in time. The cushion was the best part. It was bouncy but the air bubble popped. I feel like this shoe want to rock way too much for me.
10162,229,361,8.0,2022-01-23,user_overall,"This shoe wasn’t a bad performer, but it’s not a good shoe for shifty guards that make a lot of lateral moves like me. The lateral support is not bad, but kinda laggy. Plus the shoe is kinda bulky. It’s a good performer, but better for bigger guys."
10163,229,618,9.6,2022-01-29,user_overall,"OUTSTANDING! The materials are great, the cushioning does take some break in time, but after that it's good. The durability is second to none, and after all of that it's only $110?"
10164,229,619,8.0,2022-07-18,user_overall,Bad for outdoor and the material for the sile is bad
10165,229,32,8.0,2020-01-03,traction,The multi-directional herringbone traction pattern is pretty responsive on explosive movements but you will slip from time to time when moving at high speeds.
10166,229,293,9.0,2020-01-03,traction,"The rubber is super soft and offers a very hard bite on clean courts. Even on dusty courts, you will only experience minor slipping and wiping will give you good traction immediately."
10167,229,45,9.0,2020-04-01,traction,The grip of the traction pattern is super aggressive.
10168,229,6,7.0,2020-01-14,traction,"I didn't think the traction was very good as I would slide on lateral moves, even on clean courts. Linear moves and stops were fine."
10169,229,615,6.0,2020-02-09,traction,"Even on clean courts, I was sliding everywhere in my colorway."
10170,229,32,9.0,2020-01-03,cushion,The largest Zoom Air unit in a WhyNotZer0 sneaker in the forefoot gives you a smooth and responsive ride.
10171,229,293,9.0,2020-01-03,cushion,The cushioning feels pretty soft in the heel and the court feel is better than in the Why Not Zer0.2 but still not great. The Zoom Air in the forefoot feels bouncy and explosive.
10172,229,45,9.0,2020-04-01,cushion,The forefoot Zoom Turbo is very responsive and the injected Phylon in the heel provides you with a lot of impact protection.
10173,229,6,8.0,2020-01-14,cushion,The segmented forefoot Zoom unit is really enjoyable and the foam in the heel gives you decent impact protection.
10174,229,615,8.0,2020-02-09,cushion,The articulated Zoom felt nice right out of the gate. The setup is a little firmer compared to the Why Not Zer0.2.
10175,229,32,8.0,2020-01-03,materials,"This is the lightest shoe in Russell's signature series which is a good thing. Overall, the materials don't feel or look super premium but the get the job done."
10176,229,293,8.0,2020-01-03,materials,The materials aren't great quality-wise but it gets the job done.
10177,229,45,9.0,2020-04-01,materials,"The wild mix of materials looks flashy and is very breathable, comfortable, and breaks-in nicely."
10178,229,6,8.0,2020-01-14,materials,"The materials don't feel the most premium and your feet get hot quickly. But when it comes to performance, I have no complaints."
10179,229,615,8.0,2020-02-09,materials,The materials get the job done.
10180,229,32,9.0,2020-01-03,support,The lacing system and the forefoot strap work really well and the TPU heel counter locks your heel into place.
10181,229,293,9.0,2020-01-03,support,The midfoot strap and the lateral caging provide great containment and the added heel pillows prevent any heel slippage.
10182,229,45,8.0,2020-04-01,support,"The lateral outrigger and external heel counter work well, but the strap doesn't do much and you really need to tighten the laces to get maximum support."
10183,229,6,9.0,2020-01-14,support,"No heel slippage, no side-to-side movement on the footbed, and the lacing system pulls your feet down really tightly."
10184,229,615,9.0,2020-02-09,support,This shoe is super-duper supportive and feels very stable and safe.
10185,229,32,8.0,2020-01-03,fit,The fit and comfort are a lot less bulky compared to the predecessor and pretty good overall.
10186,229,293,8.0,2020-01-03,fit,The materials stretch out a little to accommodate your feet nicely. I also liked the additional lockdown of the midfoot strap.
10187,229,45,8.0,2020-04-01,fit,"The fit is comfortable thanks to the soft heel pillows, but I experienced a little bit of heel slippage if I didn't tighten the laces enough."
10188,229,6,9.0,2020-01-14,fit,The lacing system and strap really pull down your feet and provide a very good fit.
10189,229,293,0.0,2020-01-03,outdoor,"The rubber is very, very soft, so definitely don't play outdoors in these."
10190,229,45,0.0,2020-04-01,outdoor,The rubber is very malleable and probably won't last very long outdoors.
10191,229,293,3,2020-01-03,width,Not super snug at first and the materials stretch out a little after a while.
10192,229,45,4,2020-04-01,width,You really need to tighten the laces or wear two pairs of socks to achieve a snug fit.
10193,229,6,3,2020-01-14,width,"A little snug for me as a slightly wide-footer, but the materials stretched out nicely to accommodate my feet."
10194,229,293,3,2020-01-03,size,Go true to size.
10195,229,45,3,2020-04-01,size,True to size.
10196,229,6,3,2020-01-14,size,As a slightly wide-footer I was perfectly fine going true to size as the materials stretch out a little.
10197,230,33,9.1,2020-01-14,expert_overall,Ten years later and the Nike Kobe 5 is still just as bad ass as it was before.
10198,230,32,9.0,2020-02-04,expert_overall,This shoe truly is an updated and improved version of the Kobe V. I really like what Nike did by taking all the good things from the OG and updating traction and cushioning.
10199,230,293,8.8,2020-02-04,expert_overall,"I really enjoyed playing in the Kobe 5 again! It takes a little time to break-in, but then you get a super lightweight, minimal, and super comfortable basketball shoe."
10200,230,522,8.8,2020-02-17,expert_overall,Nike improved the traction of the OG Kobe 5 and changed it up with the Zoom Turbo cushioning. I give it a first-team rating!
10201,230,7,8.4,2025-03-12,expert_overall,The Nike Kobe 5 Protro is one of my favourite shoes right now. The standout features are the traction and the support.
10202,230,6,8.2,2020-01-19,expert_overall,This is still a great performer! But $180 is a little steep for the tech you get.
10203,230,203,9.8,2024-04-17,user_overall,"I have only recently got the Kobe 5 proctor in the ‘undefeated’ colourway. The traction has taken a while to break in, and isn’t very loud and squeaky. Either way the traction, only after 8 hours of wearing it has broken in and provided a great stop hence doing snatches and other moves in my workouts. Cushion and every other quality if the shoe was perfect if not close to perfection. Overall an amazing shoe and an even better shoe for the representation of Kobe and his amazing impact in the game"
10204,230,358,9.4,2021-12-31,user_overall,"Perfect for people who want to feel speedy and springy. These are a visually stunning shoe that have been proven to perform at the highest levels. Traction is nuts, cushion feels fast and the materials, though plasticky, mold to your feet and contain you well. I'd buy these ten times over regardless of the namesake, but resell inflation makes it not worth your while. You can get equally good if not better with your money, but if you can go there price-wise then I recommend. These are nuts."
10205,230,94,9.4,2025-02-11,user_overall,"Kobe 5 is just a great shoe. Traction is really good for translucent, takes a little break in and doesn’t pick up much dust. Perfect cushion of bounce, comfort, and impact protection. Materials are supportive, premium, and comfy but do scuff and show wear quickly. Great support from carbon plate, heel counter, and fly wire. The fit is snug at first but after the break in you are good to go."
10206,230,503,9.4,2022-03-25,user_overall,Traction is an absolute beast. After having these for a while there is dust on the shoe but it still performed extremely well. The cushion was close to being a 10 but I have another shoe with better cushion. But the cushion is extremely nice. The insole was extremely squishy and the heel compressed very well. The cushion had very nice impact protection and court feel.
10207,230,71,8.5,2025-05-07,user_overall,Recently got the Kobe 5 year of the Mamba and after playing with them about a dozen of times I found them to be not very durable which is a shame with such an expensive shoe! Also the sole turned yellowish on me in some parts which is a mystery to me why and how that happened.
10208,230,33,9.0,2020-01-14,traction,The traction pattern was updated with a little more tread compared to the original Kobe 5. The rubber picks up some dust but it's still a very good and reliable setup.
10209,230,32,8.0,2020-02-04,traction,The traction needs a little to break-in and the tighter spaced rubber treads provide better grip but also attract more dust than in the OG.
10210,230,293,8.0,2020-02-04,traction,"The traction bites really hard on clean courts, but on dusty courts, I had to wipe pretty frequently."
10211,230,522,9.0,2020-02-17,traction,Nike changed the pattern on the outsole to create more points of contact and improve the traction compared to the OG.
10212,230,7,8.0,2025-03-12,traction,"The traction performs well after an initial 30-minute break-in period, but the outsole collects dust on dirtier floors."
10213,230,6,8.0,2020-01-19,traction,"On clean courts, you will stop on a dime, but on dustier courts, you will need to wipe from time to time."
10214,230,33,9.0,2020-01-14,cushion,The new Zoom Turbo in the forefoot keeps you low-to-the-ground while still offering a bit of impact protection and springy under-foot responsiveness. The Cushlon midsole feels bouncy and responsive but sometimes it's a little bit too soft for my liking.
10215,230,32,9.0,2020-02-04,cushion,The Nike Zoom Turbo in the forefoot feels very responsive and is a great improvement. The Cushlon midsole is super spongy and soft.
10216,230,293,9.0,2020-02-04,cushion,The Zoom Turbo in the forefoot feels really nice and the full-length Cushlon foam is super soft and comfortable.
10217,230,522,8.0,2020-02-17,cushion,"I couldn't really tell where the Zoom Turbo starts and where the foam ends. Overall, this cushioning feels like a wash compared to the OG setup."
10218,230,7,9.0,2025-03-12,cushion,The forefoot Zoom bag feels snappy. I enjoy how the ride feels.
10219,230,6,8.0,2020-01-19,cushion,"The full-length Cushlon midsole is very soft and plush in the heel and the Zoom Turbo in the forefoot gives you nice bounce, responsiveness, and court feel."
10220,230,33,9.0,2020-01-14,materials,The super-thin skin-fuse material is thin enough to flex and maneuver while being strong enough to keep you contained.
10221,230,32,8.0,2020-02-04,materials,The super lightweight construction is flexible and provides a ton of containment but the OG was not very durable.
10222,230,293,8.0,2020-02-04,materials,The fuse upper materials feel stiff at first but break-in quickly.
10223,230,522,8.0,2020-02-17,materials,The upper materials are thin and pliable but take two hours to break-in.
10224,230,7,7.5,2025-03-12,materials,The materials are stiff and require a break-in period.
10225,230,6,8.0,2020-01-19,materials,The materials give you great containment and durability and perform just well. But the materials feel a little outdated to modern textiles and knits.
10226,230,33,9.0,2020-01-14,support,The heel features one of the best heel counters of all-time while the midfoot utilizes a glass composite shank plate.
10227,230,32,9.0,2020-02-04,support,The lockdown is great - your foot is not moving! The flat base and lateral outrigger keep you safe on lateral moves and quick stops.
10228,230,293,10.0,2020-02-04,support,Support and lockdown are incredible thanks to the sharp outrigger and sturdy upper materials.
10229,230,522,9.0,2020-02-17,support,"Zero issues thanks to the great fit, stable heel counter, lateral outrigger."
10230,230,7,9.0,2025-03-12,support,"For me, the support on this shoe is great. I love the shank plate and the heel counter."
10231,230,6,9.0,2020-01-19,support,"No heel slippage, no side-to-side movement, thanks to the big outrigger and tight lacing system."
10232,230,33,9.5,2020-01-14,fit,Snug and secure. Wrapping my foot up like a glove.
10233,230,293,9.0,2020-02-04,fit,Almost a 1:1 fit after the break-in period.
10234,230,522,10.0,2020-02-17,fit,"The fit is fantastic out of the box with zero heel slip, no side-to-side movement, and no dead space anywhere. One of the best-fitting basketball shoes I've ever worn."
10235,230,7,8.5,2025-03-12,fit,The fit feels the same as the Kobe 6 Protro. It breaks in nicely but it takes time.
10236,230,6,8.0,2020-01-19,fit,The fit is really good but wide-footers should maybe go up half a size.
10237,230,293,100.0,2020-02-04,outdoor,The rubber is super hard and should work fine outdoors.
10238,230,293,2,2020-02-04,width,True to size was super narrow at first but stretched out after a while.
10239,230,522,2,2020-02-17,width,Go true to size if you like a super snug fit.
10240,230,7,2,2025-03-12,width,Go up half a size if you have wide feet.
10241,230,6,1,2020-01-19,width,Super narrow.
10242,230,293,3,2020-02-04,size,I went true to size which was perfect lengthwise.
10243,230,522,2,2020-02-17,size,The safe play is half a size up.
10244,230,7,2,2025-03-12,size,I had to go up half a size.
10245,230,6,3,2020-01-19,size,True to size.
10246,231,293,8.8,2020-02-04,expert_overall,I love the performance of the PG4. This is one of my favorite shoes to play in right now! Probably the most comfortable basketball shoe you can get right now.
10247,231,45,8.6,2020-03-18,expert_overall,"The cushioning is perfect, the traction is beastly, and material, fit, and support are all above-average. If you need new shoes, I recommend the PG4!"
10248,231,33,8.3,2020-02-04,expert_overall,"Overall, the Nike PG 4 was very solid, but not as well rounded as I would have liked. The cushion is super comfortable but the containment and support are lacking a little."
10249,231,522,8.2,2020-04-30,expert_overall,"The PG4 is a good solid shoe with no major flaws at a fair price, but it isn’t something that I’d say wow, I want to hoop in these today."
10250,231,32,8.0,2020-01-14,expert_overall,Traction and cushioning are really good but materials and especially support are a little disappointing.
10251,231,6,8.0,2020-02-04,expert_overall,"For $110, this is a really good shoe. I like the traction, the cushioning is amazing, and for a signature sneaker, the PG4 is super affordable!"
10252,231,446,8.5,2022-03-16,user_overall,"I’ve played with this shoe for a couple of months now and I can say they’re a great affordable option. Traction is great on clean courts but they do slip a bit on dusty surfaces. The cushion is definitely the best part of these shoes, it’s everything you could ever ask for. The only small weakness I could find were the materials, not that premium, but expected given the price. Outdoor use is fine with these, they are gonna get damaged over time but not destroyed. Overall, I recommend them a lot."
10253,231,497,9.4,2022-01-14,user_overall,"The Nike PG 4 was an amazing shoe! It is great for guards and forwards. It is an all-around shoe that has a bit of everything for everyone. The traction was pretty solid, but durability was a big issue. Do not use these outdoors. The cushion was absolutely amazing and it was very very soft! The support was okay with enough lateral coverage. The material was a little cheap, but it wasn’t too bad for the cheap price tag. This shoe was one of my favourites, and it is an amazing shoe for its price."
10254,231,620,9.4,2023-04-12,user_overall,I got my PG4s of the normal size I wear for basketball shoes(1 size bigger than my exact size) from StockX but it's kinda tight on my foot. So I would highly recommend you to get at least 1.5 size bigger than your precise size of your ev
10255,231,320,8.8,2022-04-18,user_overall,"Amazing Shoe, probably the best cushioning I’ve ever had. However, order 1/2 size up (heel cushioning pushes foot up) The outsole isn’t very grippy, but very durable despite soft rubber. I used it outside almost every day for 2 1/2 yrs, but it held up, with only a little wear and tear. If it gets dirty, is washable, so can be used for other activities. Great shoe, with great durability, cushioning, and price (if still available). Solid 9"
10256,231,355,9.4,2023-01-15,user_overall,"If there was a dream hoop shoe for me, it would be the PG 4. The traction is so dang amazing on both colorways I have (which is the Gatora"
10257,231,293,8.0,2020-02-04,traction,"The circle traction pattern doesn't seem very durable but works really well on clean courts. On dusty courts, you will need to wipe from time to time but the traction still performed very well."
10258,231,45,9.0,2020-03-18,traction,"Even though I played on dusty courts, the traction held up very well! Close to being a 10/10 traction."
10259,231,33,9.0,2020-02-04,traction,"Traction was reliable and consistent, even on the dirtiest courts."
10260,231,522,8.0,2020-04-30,traction,"The PG4 traction pattern performed well, but I thought the PG2 and PG3 were a little bit sharper."
10261,231,32,8.0,2020-01-14,traction,The traction is pretty solid giving you grip in all directions. The translucent parts of the outsole felt a little more slippy and you will have to wipe from time to time.
10262,231,6,8.0,2020-02-04,traction,The traction is really good on clean courts and still performs well on dirtier courts. Probably just below the top tier when it comes to traction.
10263,231,293,10.0,2020-02-04,cushion,"The Nike Air strobel brings the comfort level of this shoe to the maximum. The cushioning is super soft, but therefore, less responsive than the cushioning in the PG3. This is probably my favorite cushioning setup of all time!!"
10264,231,45,10.0,2020-03-18,cushion,"The full-length Air Strobel feels like pillows under your feet. It's comfortable, responsive, and I loved the impact protection. Perfection!"
10265,231,33,9.5,2020-02-04,cushion,The full-length Nike Air cushioning feels soft and pillowy under foot.
10266,231,522,8.0,2020-04-30,cushion,"The Airsole unit combined and soft foam feel comfortable but don’t have the spring of Zoom. It works fine and my feet never hurt, but I enjoy a little bit firmer setup more."
10267,231,32,10.0,2020-01-14,cushion,The cushioning is madly comfortable! The full-length Air is super soft and plush.
10268,231,6,9.0,2020-02-04,cushion,"The Air strobel unit is very plush and comfortable. You don't get the springy feeling you would get from a Zoom unit, but this cushioning setup is super soft and comfortable."
10269,231,293,9.0,2020-02-04,materials,"The materials are soft, thin, and ventilated. On-foot the materials feel fine, but they look a little cheap."
10270,231,45,8.0,2020-03-18,materials,The Mesh shroud and internal nylon bootie construction hug your feet and are really comfortable. The breathability could be a little better overall.
10271,231,33,9.0,2020-02-04,materials,Materials are pretty standard for today’s modern textile/knit builds.
10272,231,522,8.0,2020-04-30,materials,It’s mesh and synthetics and it works fine. No pinching Or anything
10273,231,32,7.0,2020-01-14,materials,"The quality of the synthetic and Mesh materials feels a little subpar. However, they are thin, flexible, and breathable and get the job done."
10274,231,6,8.0,2020-02-04,materials,The upper is made from Mesh which doesn't feel great to the touch but it gets the job done.
10275,231,293,8.0,2020-02-04,support,I didn't have any issues with lateral moves even though the upper isn't super strong and there is almost no outrigger.
10276,231,45,8.0,2020-03-18,support,"For a low-top, the containment is really good. The outrigger gives you lateral stability and the heel is locked in nicely too."
10277,231,33,7.0,2020-02-04,support,The shoe feels soft overall and doesn't provide as much torsional or lateral support as the previous PG models.
10278,231,522,8.0,2020-04-30,support,A very solid and wide base gives you plenty of support and stability.
10279,231,32,6.0,2020-01-14,support,The support and lockdown are below average: your feet are not contained well enough on lateral cuts and there is a little bit of heel slippage.
10280,231,6,7.0,2020-02-04,support,The support is the weakest part of the PG4. You can feel your foot slightly moving of the footbed on lateral cuts. I would recommend playing with the shroud zipped up as it improves support noticeably.
10281,231,45,8.0,2020-03-18,fit,The fit holds you tightly in-place and feels super comfortable.
10282,231,33,7.0,2020-02-04,fit,"After the break-in period, the PG4 fit comfortably but a little too sloppy for my liking."
10283,231,522,9.0,2020-04-30,fit,There is no movement inside the shoe or any heel slip thanks to a nice amount of padding.
10284,231,32,8.0,2020-01-14,fit,A very plush and comfortable fit.
10285,231,6,8.0,2020-02-04,fit,I didn't feel any pinching pain and the fit of the one-bootie upper was almost 1:1.
10286,231,293,0.0,2020-02-04,outdoor,Outdoor use is not recommended as the rubber is super soft.
10287,231,45,2,2020-03-18,width,If you go true to size the shoe feels really narrow and is hard to get on.
10288,231,522,2,2020-04-30,width,The insole is super thick and there's not a lot of room in the toe area.
10289,231,6,3,2020-02-04,width,The materials loosen up over time.
10290,231,45,2,2020-03-18,size,We recommend going up half a size.
10291,231,522,1,2020-04-30,size,Go up at least half a size as these run small.
10292,231,6,2,2020-02-04,size,I went up half a size and I was perfectly fine as a slightly wide footer.
10293,232,293,7.4,2020-01-14,expert_overall,"For $80 it's a good performer, but not as good as the Kyrie Flytrap 2."
10294,232,6,7.0,2020-02-04,expert_overall,The cushioning is rock hard and the materials feel cheap. I would only recommend these for outdoor use.
10295,232,621,6.6,2022-11-28,user_overall,"1st, the toe box is way too narrow & will give you Bunions. 2nd, the heel raise is so annoying, forces a heel strike, shortens your achilles/calves, and is really bad. 3rd, the toe spring is annoying/bad too. 4th, there’s way too much cushion/support. I can’t feel anything that I’m stepping/landing on in these & my feet probably got weaker from atrophy. The grip is fine but it wore out from 15 months of parkour. Even for basketball, I wouldn’t wear them. At least Naturathletics or Xero/unshod."
10296,232,575,7.5,2022-02-10,user_overall,"These shoes are a good option not the best if you´re looking for shoes with a good cushion, but the traction is too hard sometimes lol, I tripped my first time using these, everything else is pretty much decent, this shoe is good for outdoors and indoors just not the best cushion"
10297,232,622,9.0,2023-06-05,user_overall,Have had these versions of Kyries for the past 5 years and they have lasted me so long after extensive use and the grip and materials continue to stay solid. If they were still available I would 100% pick them up again.
10298,232,524,7.0,2022-03-22,user_overall,The traction was good after being broken in (which took about 3 months) but does pick up dust easily. The cushioning was terrible and stiff as a rock. Wouldn’t recommend this shoe to anyone.
10299,232,623,5.1,2022-06-13,user_overall,Terrible shoe for basketball with awful cushion and lateral support. Outdoor use is the only thing thats decent when it come to the flytrap 3
10300,232,293,8.0,2020-01-14,traction,"After the break-in period, the traction got pretty good but not as good as in the Flytrap 2."
10301,232,6,8.0,2020-02-04,traction,"The rubber took a little to break-in but after that, the traction was solid on clean courts. On dusty courts, you need to wipe frequently to avoid sliding out."
10302,232,293,5.0,2020-01-14,cushion,The cushioning is horrible. There is absolutely no compression or impact protection.
10303,232,6,5.0,2020-02-04,cushion,The cushioning is hard as a rock - a no go for me.
10304,232,293,8.0,2020-01-14,materials,The Mesh and synthetic leather upper materials are thin and conform nicely to your feet.
10305,232,6,6.0,2020-02-04,materials,The Mesh upper is thin and feels really flimsy and cheap. The Flytrap 3 is a budget shoe and it really shows.
10306,232,293,8.0,2020-01-14,support,The lateral containment is very good and the cushioning is super low-to-the-ground which offsets the rounded outsole on lateral cuts.
10307,232,6,8.0,2020-02-04,support,"No heel slippage, no side-to-side movement on the footbed, and I never felt unstable on lateral or linear movements."
10308,232,293,8.0,2020-01-14,fit,The fit was snug with no dead space at all.
10309,232,6,8.0,2020-02-04,fit,The fit was pretty good and will work best for narrow feet.
10310,232,293,100.0,2020-01-14,outdoor,You should be okay to play outdoors.
10311,232,6,100.0,2020-02-04,outdoor,The rubber is super hard and will work fine outdoors.
10312,232,6,1,2020-02-04,width,The Kyrie Flytrap 3 is super narrow.
10313,232,6,2,2020-02-04,size,Go up half a size unless you have very narrow feet.
10314,233,615,9.5,2020-02-29,expert_overall,Overall the Way of Wade 8 was fire! These are just a great hoop shoe and the traction was finally superb. These are a double thumbs up.
10315,233,33,9.2,2020-02-18,expert_overall,"Overall, the Way of Wade 8 surprised me and was a great shoe to play in. They are definitely expensive, but I feel like I got what I paid for in the materials and Carbon Fiber. If these sound interesting to you, I'd recommend trying them out and you might be pleasantly surprised."
10316,233,293,9.2,2020-03-18,expert_overall,"Overall, I fully enjoyed playing in this shoe and it will definitely be in my rotation. It is a very responsive shoe with great traction, cushion, and stability to back it up. The craftsmanship of the Way of Wade 8 is incredible."
10317,233,624,8.5,2022-07-22,user_overall,"The Way of  Wade 8 by Li-Ning was not as good as the reviews say. keep in mind that I may have gotten one with issues. The grip was not the best that I have felt. The materials felt quite cheap in my opinion, I personally would've gone with something like the PG6 if you were looking for the shoe in this sort of style."
10318,233,625,9.0,2023-11-29,user_overall,"Great stability and traction, cusion and ankle protection good as well. They are responsive, after broken in which does take some time. 9/10"
10319,233,626,9.0,2021-11-22,user_overall,A great shoe overall. There is room for more improvement in cushioning.

10322,233,615,9.0,2020-02-29,traction,"The one thing I was most excited about on the Way of Wade 8 was the traction. It was fire! No issues at all and I think they killed it with this traction. It didn't matter if it was a clean or dirty court, it just worked. These are A1."
10323,233,33,9.0,2020-02-18,traction,"I played in the Way of Wade 8 on several types of floors and was pleasantly surprised each time! Previous models have had issues with traction, but these did a great job on the hardwood. I only had issues when I stepped in some sweat which is expected."
10324,233,293,9.0,2020-03-18,traction,"The traction performed incredibly well on a clean court and these have a really nice squeak. The WOW 8 didn't perform that well on dust for me and wasn't too easy to wipe. Overall, traction was incredible just watch out if you're playing on dust."
10325,233,615,10.0,2020-02-29,cushion,This cushion setup is called BOOM and it performed exactly how it sounds! These are more responsive and slightly less plush than the Way of Wade 6. It feels great on foot and provides a soft and responsive setup.
10326,233,33,9.0,2020-02-18,cushion,These use BOOM cushion which is similar to Boost without being as soft. This cushion setup is great at absorbing impact similar to Nike Zoom Air which really impressed me. Outdoors they shined where the blacktop was very unforgiving and definitely held their own.
10327,233,293,10.0,2020-03-18,cushion,"They are using full-length BOOM cushioning here which has to be one of my favorite cushion technologies. It looks pretty similar to Boost, but this feels lighter and more comfortable. It is plush, soft, and a really nice bounce to it. There is also good impact protection and court feel. It had everything I wanted in a cushion setup and is incredible."
10328,233,615,9.0,2020-02-29,materials,"The upper was a super durable mesh which this is probably the nicest mesh I've seen on a shoe. It is durable and supportive, so I think that these will last you for a full season. They take a little bit of time to break in which I didn't have an issue with. Overall I think these materials are dope."
10329,233,33,9.0,2020-02-18,materials,"The main material used here is Cordura's Nylon with some TPU fuse panels for added durability. The material didn't stretch much which  overall made these a great build for basketball style moves. There was nice flexibility, but with strong support to back it up."
10330,233,293,9.0,2020-03-18,materials,"In the forefoot and most of the upper they are using a Cordura fabric which is known for its durability. It has a rugged, durable feel without being thick. It feels soft and supportive which conforms to your foot well. I was slightly disappointed they couldn't use the Boa lacing system here, but the traditional laces work well."
10331,233,615,10.0,2020-02-29,support,How can I put this... EXCEL-EN-TE! Looking at the support on these I can't complain about anything. The heel cup was made after a race car seat and I just felt locked in the whole time. The strap on these is also functional and works great.
10332,233,33,10.0,2020-02-18,support,The support on these is Hall of Fame level. They were very supportive without being too restrictive. Using EVA and TPU caging helps a lot with lateral cuts and changing direction. These also feature a Carbon Fiber shank which wasn't too much for me and broke in well.
10333,233,293,9.0,2020-03-18,support,The lateral containment was incredible and I had no doubts about it. The plastic coming up the side with the foam and the strap really lock you in. The lateral stability is great too with an outrigger and a wide base. There is good ankle support too because the materials around the area are very rigid. One thing I didn't like is how high the ankle piece comes up on the back.
10334,233,33,9.0,2020-02-18,fit,The lockdown here is great and very secure all the way around. I liked the traditional lacing system here as opposed to the Boa-style lacing which I find just adds unnecessary weight.
10335,233,293,9.0,2020-03-18,fit,"The fit in the forefoot area was a little snug at first but broke in well. One issue I had was a piece of the foam was rubbing the side of my foot, but I was able to loosen the laces and it fixed the issue. The strap on the front tightens your forefoot very well. Overall the fit was great after breaking in."
10336,233,293,100.0,2020-03-18,outdoor,These should be okay for outdoor use. The outsole material is pretty hard and thick.
10337,233,293,4,2020-03-18,size,These run a little long and I'd recommend going down half a size.
10338,234,365,8.3,2020-02-18,expert_overall,"It's not my favorite hoops shoe, but it might work for guards with wider feet who are looking for a very responsive shoe."
10339,234,293,7.6,2020-02-18,expert_overall,"I don't recommend the UA Spawn 2. Cushioning was really bad, traction wasn't good, and the fit didn't work for me at all. Even at $100, there are much better performers out there!"
10340,234,629,7.6,2023-01-29,user_overall,It was a very overall comfortable shoe but I experienced lots of slippage in the soles to the point where I just replaced them.
10341,234,432,8.0,2022-10-03,user_overall,"Actually not bad, they are very good for outdoor and they are just beautiful."

10344,234,365,9.5,2020-02-18,traction,Traction is easily the best aspect of the Spawn 2 as stopping power is great on all types of surfaces.
10345,234,293,7.0,2020-02-18,traction,"The traction takes a little time to break-in to become good. Unfortunately, the grip is a little worse and the rubber picks up more dust compared to last year's version of the UA Spawn."
10346,234,365,9.0,2020-02-18,cushion,"The Micro-G feels is lightweight, minimal, and feels very responsive with minimal lag time."
10347,234,293,6.0,2020-02-18,cushion,The full-length Micro-G cushioning feels super stiff with very little compression or bounce. Impact protection is not good at all.
10348,234,365,9.0,2020-02-18,materials,The neoprene-like upper materials flex very well and move with the foot nicely.
10349,234,293,9.0,2020-02-18,materials,"The upper Mesh and neoprene upper materials are soft, thin, and conform nicely to your feet. I also like the plush tongue and comfortable ankle padding."
10350,234,365,7.0,2020-02-18,support,I wish this shoe would feature stronger and more supportive upper materials and a wide base.
10351,234,293,9.0,2020-02-18,support,Lateral containment and stability are great.
10352,234,365,7.0,2020-02-18,fit,There was too much dead space in the forefoot and the materials are too stretchy to provide enough containment.
10353,234,293,7.0,2020-02-18,fit,"At first, the fit was pretty snug but the Mesh stretched out too much for my liking after playing in these shoes for a while."
10354,234,293,0.0,2020-02-18,outdoor,You shouldn't play outdoors in these as the rubber is very pliable.
10355,234,293,4,2020-02-18,width,The fit was regular in the beginning but the material stretches out easily over time.
10356,234,293,3,2020-02-18,size,Go true to size lengthwise.
10357,235,6,8.2,2020-02-20,expert_overall,"This is a great performer, especially for a budget model! I had a lot of fun playing in the Harden Stepback."
10358,235,293,7.8,2020-02-20,expert_overall,"For an $80 shoe, this is a pretty good performer! Other than the traction on dust and the firm cushioning, I enjoyed the Harden Stepback a lot."
10359,235,314,7.2,2023-04-26,user_overall,"Honestly I've been using this shoe for years now and it's ok. It's not amazing, but also not bad. The durability of the shoes (Both the uppers and the traction) is it's strongest point. It'll last you years, even without much care. The traction is ok, but I think it performs better outdoors. It isn't breathable at all as it heats up a lot. And the support and lockdown is ok with minimal heel slippage, but it is comfortable. I think it is a soild budget shoe, that clearly shows it's cost."
10360,235,632,6.9,2023-10-12,user_overall,"I thought the sneaker didnt have Good durability. Alter a long time of playing it had bad traction,  Despite that, The sneakers are Good for The price."
10361,235,72,7.0,2021-12-23,user_overall,"an OK shoe, not really good, and not really bad. Just average."
10362,235,633,7.4,2022-05-08,user_overall,"Pretty bad traction, besides that a good shoe for its price."
10363,235,634,9.4,2022-08-30,user_overall,Very reliable! Lasted 2 years for school basketball shoes.
10364,235,6,8.0,2020-02-20,traction,The traditional herringbone traction pattern is really nice on clean courts but collects dust easily on dirty courts.
10365,235,293,8.0,2020-02-20,traction,"The traction bites the floor really nicely on clean courts. On dusty courts, you need to wipe constantly."
10366,235,6,8.0,2020-02-20,cushion,The full-length Bounce cushioning offers great impact protection in the heel and feels more responsive in the forefoot.
10367,235,293,6.0,2020-02-20,cushion,The cushioning is caged along the whole foot which gives you great court feel but the impact protection is bad.
10368,235,6,8.0,2020-02-20,materials,The materials are nothing special but get the job done.
10369,235,293,8.0,2020-02-20,materials,The different synthetic and Mesh materials feel comfortable and get the job done.
10370,235,6,9.0,2020-02-20,support,The wide base offers a lot of stability for lateral cuts and I didn't have any heel slippage which is rare for me in Harden models.
10371,235,293,9.0,2020-02-20,support,Support and lockdown are really good thanks to the wide base and the raised midsole.
10372,235,6,8.0,2020-02-20,fit,There is a lot of padding in the heel and the lacing system works well.
10373,235,293,0.0,2020-02-20,outdoor,The soft rubber will probably not last for a long time outdoors.
10374,235,293,4,2020-02-20,width,The fit is slightly wide.
10375,235,293,4,2020-02-20,size,Go true to your Adidas size (which is a half size smaller than Nike)
10376,236,6,8.6,2019-12-18,expert_overall,"If you are only playing on clean courts, I can absolutely recommend the Dame 6 because it's a great performer. If you play on dusty courts be prepared to wipe or better stay away."
10377,236,293,8.4,2019-12-17,expert_overall,"The Dame 6 is probably my favorite shoe in the Dame series. The Lightstrike cushioning is super nice, traction is really good on clean courts and you get all that for a very affordable price!"
10378,236,45,8.2,2020-02-04,expert_overall,"The Dame 6 is super light, comfortable and provides good traction. Unfortunately, it suffers a little from sizing issues and slightly lacking lockdown."
10379,236,615,8.0,2019-12-26,expert_overall,"Overall, I'm a fan of the Dame 6 and I think it's worth $110. But the traction of the translucent outsole and the durability of the upper material could be better."
10380,236,2,8.0,2021-05-07,expert_overall,"The Adidas Dame 6 is a good option for the price. The Lightstrike cushion does a good job of balancing bounce with responsiveness and court feel. It feels quick to play in because it is lightweight, but keep in mind that the traction can be inconsistent on dirtier courts."
10381,236,522,7.6,2019-12-20,expert_overall,"Traction could be a little better and the tippy and unstable outsole might be a non-issue for a lot of players but is a no-go for my oft-injured ankles. Other than that, the Dame 6 plays very well in every category."
10382,236,33,6.6,2020-01-03,expert_overall,Traction and support should have been much better. Fit needs work and the materials are as cheap as they come. I can't recommend the Dame 6.
10383,236,221,6.4,2020-02-04,expert_overall,"I like the looks of the Dame 6, but it just doesn't play good. The Lightstrike foam worked well, but the rest of the shoe was average at best and the traction was legitimately bad."
10384,236,358,8.4,2021-12-31,user_overall,"This shoe is awesome fun to play in, though the materials haven't been the best. After about a year's worth of wear my laces snapped and the toecap split, but the sheer greatness of the cushion had me choosing it over other options regardless. They look slick as, and make you feel super athletic once you break them in. Traction is inconsistent, has some really good moments followed by some equally scary ones. Fit was strange but the materials will conform to your foot after wear."
10385,236,605,8.5,2023-01-26,user_overall,"Nice cushion,but durability of lightstrike concrete on this shoe is a terrible.Very nice and average shoe like 8/10"
10386,236,635,8.2,2022-10-20,user_overall,"Good shoe, not the best on dusty courts, cushion is THE BEST. everything else is average"

10389,236,6,7.0,2019-12-18,traction,"The full-length herringbone traction pattern is kinda disappointing. It works really well on clean courts, but picks up a lot of dust and is super annoying on your average court."
10390,236,293,9.0,2019-12-17,traction,"On clean courts, the traction is awesome. Unfortunately, the outsole picks up dust quickly and you will experience some slip-ups."
10391,236,45,8.0,2020-02-04,traction,The herringbone traction pattern made from translucent rubber grips the floor well but attracts a decent amount of dust.
10392,236,615,7.0,2019-12-26,traction,"You will have to wipe this shoe a lot! I was slipping and sliding more than I cared for. For the average consumer who doesn't play on freshly waxed NBA courts, this traction was okay at best."
10393,236,2,7.0,2021-05-07,traction,I have mixed feelings about the traction. You need to wipe often on dusty courts and I found myself sliding a bit. It does perform better on clean courts though.
10394,236,522,8.0,2019-12-20,traction,This set up is not the best ever but it is more than adequate on all surfaces.
10395,236,33,5.0,2020-01-03,traction,"The traction of the Dame 6 was simply awful for me. I had to wipe a lot, and it's not a quick wipe either!"
10396,236,221,5.0,2020-02-04,traction,"The traction is truly awful. I felt like playing in the mud with these on. This particular translucent rubber compound picks up a lot of dust, so be prepared to wipe, and wipe, and wipe some more."
10397,236,6,10.0,2019-12-18,cushion,The Lightstrike cushioning is super awesome and gives you a lot of impact protection in the heel and court feel and responsiveness in the forefoot.
10398,236,293,10.0,2019-12-17,cushion,The full-length Lightstrike cushioning is my favorite part of this shoe. It's soft and bouncy both in the forefoot and heel. But it's also responsive and provides a good court feel.
10399,236,45,9.0,2020-02-04,cushion,"The Lightstrike cushioning is light, provides responsiveness, impact protection and is super comfortable on-foot."
10400,236,615,10.0,2019-12-26,cushion,Lightstrike is even better than Bounce! Imagine a Bounce cushioning - just a little softer.
10401,236,2,9.0,2021-05-07,cushion,"The cushion in the Dame 6 is bouncy, and provides ample impact protection. It actually impressed me quite a bit compared to the Harden Vol. 4."
10402,236,522,8.0,2019-12-20,cushion,Overall I enjoy playing in Lightstrike cushioning but the lacking durability is a concern.
10403,236,33,9.0,2020-01-03,cushion,"The Lightstrike cushioning is not too thin. For a guard shoe, this was just right."
10404,236,221,8.0,2020-02-04,cushion,The Lightstrike foam has a good balance of responsiveness and impact protection which is perfect for a guard shoe.
10405,236,6,8.0,2019-12-18,materials,"The mix of mesh, nylon, and suede is just fine."
10406,236,293,7.0,2019-12-17,materials,The suede and mesh materials feel cheap but get the job done.
10407,236,45,9.0,2020-02-04,materials,The textile Mesh performs well and feels great on-foot and requires no break-in period. One of the lightest and most comfortable shoes I've ever played in.
10408,236,615,7.0,2019-12-26,materials,"I feel like the materials of this shoe were rushed. In the toe area, the mesh of the upper is coming off the outsole rubber after only a few weeks."
10409,236,2,8.0,2021-05-07,materials,"The upper is mostly made of mesh. In terms of performance, it does its job."
10410,236,522,7.0,2019-12-20,materials,The suede patches look below average to me and the rest of the shoe is just mesh made of different densities.
10411,236,33,5.0,2020-01-03,materials,The textile materials feel and play cheap. Durability is a real issue as my shoe is already falling apart.
10412,236,221,7.0,2020-02-04,materials,These materials are just cheap to be cheap and not very durable.
10413,236,6,9.0,2019-12-18,support,"No heel slippage, no side-to-side movements on the footbed, and no instabilities on lateral moves."
10414,236,293,8.0,2019-12-17,support,I felt laterally stable and my heel was locked down nicely.
10415,236,45,7.0,2020-02-04,support,"Unfortunately, the light and flexible upper materials don't provide as much lockdown as other more sturdy materials."
10416,236,2,8.0,2021-05-07,support,The shoe is very supportive with the layering of materials on the lateral side of the shoe. The heel counter and achilles pillows also feel nice around your ankle.
10417,236,522,6.0,2019-12-20,support,Ankle support is good but the stability is a no go for me. The outsole is heavily curved and rolls to the side way too easily.
10418,236,33,7.0,2020-01-03,support,The materials buckle easily and my heel wasn't properly locked in.
10419,236,221,6.0,2020-02-04,support,The materials are too flimsy to provide enough lockdown.
10420,236,6,9.0,2019-12-18,fit,The overall fit of the Dame 6 way really good.
10421,236,293,8.0,2019-12-17,fit,The fit was pretty good for me. The shoe is easy to get-on and easily laced.
10422,236,45,8.0,2020-02-04,fit,The fit feels A1.
10423,236,2,8.0,2021-05-07,fit,"They are a bit roomy, so when I went half a size down I had no issues with the fit."
10424,236,522,9.0,2019-12-20,fit,No heel slip or side-to-side movement out of the box thanks to a higher cut and a nice plush ankle collar.
10425,236,33,7.0,2020-01-03,fit,"Lockdown was okay, but nothing noteworthy."
10426,236,221,6.0,2020-02-04,fit,The fit is very disappointing.
10427,236,293,0.0,2019-12-17,outdoor,The rubber is pretty deep but also soft. Won't last very long outdoors.
10428,236,45,0.0,2020-02-04,outdoor,I wouldn't take these outdoors because the translucent rubber compound wears away quickly.
10429,236,293,3,2019-12-17,width,The width is around normal.
10430,236,45,4,2020-02-04,width,The fit was great wearing two pairs of socks.
10431,236,2,3,2021-05-07,width,"If you have wide feet, I would go true to size since there is a good amount of space in the toe box."
10432,236,522,3,2019-12-20,width,Regular.
10433,236,293,4,2019-12-17,size,Go down half a size from your normal size.
10434,236,45,4,2020-02-04,size,You can go down half a size or go true to size and wear two pairs of socks.
10435,236,2,4,2021-05-07,size,I would recommend half a size down.
10436,236,522,3,2019-12-20,size,Trueish to size!
10437,237,293,8.6,2019-12-26,expert_overall,"For $160, you get Nike's best tech: full-length Zoom Air, Flyknit materials and FlyEase lacing system."
10438,237,6,7.8,2019-12-26,expert_overall,"The cushioning and materials are great, but traction and fit were problematic for me. Overall, I couldn't enjoy playing in these shoes because they are just too narrow for my feet."
10439,237,516,6.8,2020-01-04,expert_overall,"These are nice shoes for casual wear, but don't wear these on-court!"
10440,237,293,8.0,2019-12-26,traction,"The nodule traction pattern, made from super-soft rubber, works well on clean courts and picks up minimal dust on dirty courts. On really hard cuts you will slide out sometimes."
10441,237,6,6.0,2019-12-26,traction,"The traction is consistent, but not great. The traction pattern doesn't really give you hard stops, instead, you will be sliding to a stop most of the time."
10442,237,516,5.0,2020-01-04,traction,"I am sooo disappointed in the traction, I couldn't get any grip at all!"
10443,237,293,10.0,2019-12-26,cushion,"The cushioning is my favorite part of this shoe. The Zoom Strobel board is very similar to the KD12 and feels very comfortable, bouncy, and provides great court feel."
10444,237,6,10.0,2019-12-26,cushion,"The full-length Zoom Strobel feels extremely nice. It's low-to-the-ground, bouncy, and probably my favorite cushioning setup right now."
10445,237,516,10.0,2020-01-04,cushion,The cushioning is A+ in my book!
10446,237,293,9.0,2019-12-26,materials,The Flyknit materials feel a little flimsy but they are soft and conform to your feet nicely after the break-in period.
10447,237,6,9.0,2019-12-26,materials,The Flyknit materials are super nice.
10448,237,516,7.0,2020-01-04,materials,The Flyknit upper is super comfortable but just not supportive at all for basketball.
10449,237,293,8.0,2019-12-26,support,"The upper materials are really supportive and provide a lot of lockdown in the midfoot. There is a little bit of heel slippage, especially while the shoes are not yet broken-in."
10450,237,6,8.0,2019-12-26,support,"There was some minor heel slippage on my right foot. Other than that, the support was just fine."
10451,237,516,5.0,2020-01-04,support,"I didn't feel supported at all in the Zoom UNVRS. On lateral cuts, I completely slid off the footbed."
10452,237,293,8.0,2019-12-26,fit,The FlyEase system works and makes it super-easy to put these shoes on.
10453,237,6,6.0,2019-12-26,fit,The FlyEase mechanism in the heel really dug-in to my Achilles which was very painful and the fit was too narrow for my slightly wide feet.
10454,237,293,0.0,2019-12-26,outdoor,The super-soft rubber probably won't last very long outdoors.
10455,237,6,1,2019-12-26,width,I'm a slightly wide-footer and this shoe is extremely narrow.
10456,237,6,3,2019-12-26,size,"Go true to size if you have narrow or regular feet. Otherwise, go up half a size."
10457,238,33,8.7,2019-10-30,expert_overall,"The Under Armour Curry 7 is a beast on-court.  Traction and support are awesome, materials work perfectly, and they fit me like a glove. Only the firm cushioning is slightly disappointing."
10458,238,293,8.4,2019-11-15,expert_overall,"The performance of the Under Armour Curry 7 is really nice, especially if you are looking for a quick, minimal low-top shoe. But for $140, the materials and the cushion technology feels a little underwhelming."
10459,238,45,8.4,2020-02-04,expert_overall,The traction is outstanding and everything else is perfectly good. Under Armour really needs to share the secret to their rubber compound!
10460,238,6,8.2,2019-11-21,expert_overall,This is a great performer with some slight problems: the materials don't feel worthy of a $140 signature model and the cushioning is very firm.
10461,238,522,8.0,2019-11-21,expert_overall,The Curry 7 is a solid all-around shoe with cushioning on the firmer side and some feedback/bounce.
10462,238,456,9.1,2022-01-13,user_overall,"I really enjoyed playing in the Curry 7. The traction was A tier and the materials great after some quick breaking in. The support was on point and I felt very quick in these! The cushion is somewhat lacking, but I actually enjoyed the experience and it felt extremely responsive! The Curry 7 is definitely worth the pickup!"
10463,238,192,8.7,2024-03-16,user_overall,"This was my first pair of signature shoes from my favorite player of all time. Though its materials may be questionable, its the traction, support, durability and court feel I care most about. I'll certainly miss wearing this model."
10464,238,567,8.0,2022-03-15,user_overall,The curry 7 is a shoe you either love or hate. The materials feel cheap and the traction was good except for super dusty courts! Wouldn’t recommend for a long season as they wouldn’t last
10465,238,638,9.0,2022-09-02,user_overall,"Very good shoe, holds up well on all fronts. More suited towards lighter and faster players. Traction is consistent, even on dust. Truly great shoe."
10466,238,639,8.4,2021-11-17,user_overall,I have had these shoes for about 3 months and the traction pattern is gone. It's actually just flat.
10467,238,33,9.0,2019-10-30,traction,The multidirectional herringbone traction pattern grips the floor quietly and doesn't require you to wipe no matter where you play.
10468,238,293,9.0,2019-11-15,traction,You get a really nice (and silent) bite and you get almost no dust pickup at all.
10469,238,45,10.0,2020-02-04,traction,The traction was perfect even though we played on some of the dustiest courts in the country.
10470,238,6,10.0,2019-11-21,traction,Traction is phenomenal on clean courts and dust pick up on dorty courts is minimal.
10471,238,522,9.0,2019-11-21,traction,Very minimal wiping and consistent grip makes me a happy camper!
10472,238,33,7.0,2019-10-30,cushion,"Unfortunately, the cushion feels much like it does on every other Curry signature shoe — lackluster and firm."
10473,238,293,7.0,2019-11-15,cushion,The blend of HOVR and Micro-G is super stiff and gives you a lot of court feel. There is zero compression or bounce and impact protection is just okay.
10474,238,45,8.0,2020-02-04,cushion,"The combination of HOVR and MicroG foam provides a mix of court feel, impact protection, and responsiveness."
10475,238,6,7.0,2019-11-21,cushion,"The cushioning is super firm which is great if you are looking for court feel and responsiveness. But if you are looking for a soft and bouncy cushioning, this is not it!"
10476,238,522,7.0,2019-11-21,cushion,"Overall, cushioning is okay. But if you are looking for a soft and bouncy ride you will be disappointed."
10477,238,33,9.0,2019-10-30,materials,The textile and synthetic materials work well on-court but don't really feel worthy for a Steph Curry signature model.
10478,238,293,8.0,2019-11-15,materials,"The quality of the materials feels a little bit cheap, especially for the $140 retail price. But the on-court performance is solid and the comfort is good after the break-in period."
10479,238,45,8.0,2020-02-04,materials,The materials need a little break-in time but they work perfectly well.
10480,238,6,7.0,2019-11-21,materials,"The materials are one of the letdowns of the shoe. The mesh doesn't feel premium and the TPU overlays feel super ""plasticky"". For $140, I expected much better materials."
10481,238,522,7.0,2019-11-21,materials,These are easily the least luxurious looking and feeling materials out the seven Curry signature shoes.
10482,238,33,9.5,2019-10-30,support,This might be the most supportive Curry since the Curry 1.
10483,238,293,9.0,2019-11-15,support,I felt laterally stable and my feet were contained nicely on the footbed.
10484,238,45,8.0,2020-02-04,support,"The internal heel counter, lateral outrigger, raised midsole, and overall fit combine for really nice support even if you don't wear an ankle brace like Steph Curry."
10485,238,6,9.0,2019-11-21,support,Support features are pretty standard and I didn't have any heel slippage or instabilities.
10486,238,522,9.0,2019-11-21,support,The Curry 7 is a very supportive shoe!
10487,238,33,9.0,2019-10-30,fit,The fit felt similar to the Curry Zero.3 and a little better than the Curry 6.
10488,238,293,9.0,2019-11-15,fit,The fit is incredible for me.
10489,238,45,8.0,2020-02-04,fit,The fit starts off a little stiff but gets better after the break-in period.
10490,238,6,8.0,2019-11-21,fit,"I had a little bit of bunching up in the forefoot but other than that, the fit is really nice and comfortable."
10491,238,522,8.0,2019-11-21,fit,Some slight break-in time is needed but then you get a comfortable and nicely conforming fit.
10492,238,293,50.0,2019-11-15,outdoor,The rubber is quite soft but the grooves are pretty deep. These should be solid outdoors but probably not the best choice overall.
10493,238,45,100.0,2020-02-04,outdoor,The solid rubber works well outdoors.
10494,238,6,2,2019-11-21,width,"If you have very wide feet, going up half a size might be a good idea."
10495,238,522,2,2019-11-21,width,The toe box is narrower than normal.
10496,238,293,3,2019-11-15,size,I went true to size.
10497,238,6,3,2019-11-21,size,I went true to size and I was perfectly fine.
10498,238,522,2,2019-11-21,size,I went with true to size but I could have probably gone up half a size.
10499,239,293,8.8,2019-11-03,expert_overall,"Puma really surprised me with the Puma Clyde Hardwood. For $120, I 100% recommend this shoe!"
10500,239,33,8.8,2019-11-13,expert_overall,PUMA really nailed it with the Clyde Hardwood. A nice blend of old school leather and modern performance with beastly traction and decent cushioning.
10501,239,2,8.6,2021-05-07,expert_overall,"The Puma Clyde Hardwood is a great shoe. It's low to the ground, responsive, and has amazing traction. The materials are nice, and they help to create a solid fit. The only thing I wished Puma did was uncage the foam a little more."
10502,239,640,7.4,2021-11-21,user_overall,Great show with great traction especially on good courts. I did get some nasty blisters though.

10507,239,293,9.0,2019-11-03,traction,"The bite on a clean court is amazing and stops on a dime with a nice little squeak. Picks up dust easily, but a quick wipe and you're good to go!"
10508,239,33,9.5,2019-11-13,traction,"On every other court, I played on I never had to wipe the soles at all."
10509,239,2,9.0,2021-05-07,traction,"The traction is multidirectional herringbone, and I love it. It's very tacky and really grips the court."
10510,239,293,8.0,2019-11-03,cushion,"Once the cushioning is broken in the foam is actually pretty soft even though the rubber is heavily caged. If you like a responsive and minimal cushioning setup, this is a great choice."
10511,239,33,7.0,2019-11-13,cushion,The cushioning is not horrible but it's as basic as it gets. ProFoam is a standard foam that offers a responsive ride that’s low to the ground.
10512,239,2,8.0,2021-05-07,cushion,I'm really impressed with the cushion. Impact protection becomes softer the more you play in them.
10513,239,293,9.0,2019-11-03,materials,The fully knitted material in the front is really soft and feels incredible. The leather and suede in the heel feel very premium.
10514,239,33,9.5,2019-11-13,materials,Textiles and synthetics in the forefoot and old-school genuine leather from the midfoot to the heel. I absolutely love the material setup.
10515,239,2,8.0,2021-05-07,materials,The upper is made up of mesh and leather. It performs well and feels nice on foot.
10516,239,293,9.0,2019-11-03,support,The caging on the lateral side contains your feet nicely and the wide base gives you a ton of stability.
10517,239,33,9.0,2019-11-13,support,The flat base and extensive TPU midsole cage provide all the stability and support you need.
10518,239,2,9.0,2021-05-07,support,The materials combined with the raised sidewalls on the cushion help to provide ample support.
10519,239,293,9.0,2019-11-03,fit,No toe space and comfortable textiles - the fit was really nice for me.
10520,239,33,9.0,2019-11-13,fit,There is nothing better than a nicely broken-in leather shoe.
10521,239,2,9.0,2021-05-07,fit,"There is a good amount of space in the forefoot, and the shoe fits great once you tighten the laces slightly."
10522,239,293,100.0,2019-11-03,outdoor,The durability of the rubber should be good.
10523,239,2,3,2021-05-07,width,The shoe is wide footer friendly.
10524,239,2,4,2021-05-07,size,I went half a size down with a regular shaped foot.
10525,240,33,9.2,2019-12-17,expert_overall,This is one of the best basketball shoes of 2019!
10526,240,6,8.8,2019-11-20,expert_overall,"This is a great performer. I would highly recommend picking up a pair, Kawhi Leonard and New Balance really knocked it out of the park!"
10527,240,293,8.6,2019-11-06,expert_overall,"Incredible! I really like the shoe, especially the super comfortable cushioning."
10528,240,522,8.0,2020-01-02,expert_overall,"I loved the traction and the fit is pretty good, but cushioning is too dense for my liking and containment is seriously lacking."

10530,240,643,9.0,2021-11-21,user_overall,"Best traction I've ever had in a basketball shoe hands down; it is great regardless the surface. Very stable and protective cushioning as well. The knit tongue and collar area also really helps create a snug and comfortable fit. My only complaint is that I wish the cushioning had a bit more bounce in it. The impact protection is good, but my feet do hurt after a couple hours of playtime."
10531,240,644,9.6,2022-03-29,user_overall,Good shoes. Very comfortable. Very good outdoors and indoors.

10534,240,33,10.0,2019-12-17,traction,"For me, this is the best traction I’ve used all year long."
10535,240,6,9.0,2019-11-20,traction,"The full-herringbone traction pattern is freaking amazing on clean courts. On dusty courts, you will need to wipe frequently."
10536,240,293,8.0,2019-11-06,traction,"On a clean court, you stop on a dime, but on dirty courts, the translucent rubber picks up dust like no other."
10537,240,522,9.0,2020-01-02,traction,Definitely one of the best traction set ups I’ve tried this year.
10538,240,33,9.0,2019-12-17,cushion,"The Fuel Cell setup is awesome and provides everything I'm looking for: court feel, stability and cushion."
10539,240,6,10.0,2019-11-20,cushion,"The full-length Fuel Cell is really, really nice. I think this is one of the best cushioning setups for guards as it gives your everything: good impact protection, a decent amount of bounce, responsiveness and court feel."
10540,240,293,10.0,2019-11-06,cushion,The full-length FuelCell cushioning is incredible and feels like a mellower version of Adidas' Boost. This is up there with my favorite cushioning setups.
10541,240,522,7.0,2020-01-02,cushion,The Fuelcell cushioning feels far denser than other premium foams and isn't very soft or springy.
10542,240,33,9.0,2019-12-17,materials,The textile upper is pretty standard for today’s modern basketball shoes but feels more durable than most textiles.
10543,240,6,9.0,2019-11-20,materials,The slightly rubber-coated textile upper feels pretty good.
10544,240,293,9.0,2019-11-06,materials,The plush upper materials feel soft and comfortable.
10545,240,522,9.0,2020-01-02,materials,Omn1s’ Fitweave reminds of Flyknit and Primeknit. It's really good-looking and is very soft to the touch.
10546,240,33,9.0,2019-12-17,support,"The standard support features — torsion shank, heel counter, and outrigger — all work really well together."
10547,240,6,7.0,2019-11-20,support,"There was no heel slippage and ankle support was fine, but I felt my foot sliding over the footbed occasionally."
10548,240,293,8.0,2019-11-06,support,"I felt the upper material on the lateral side stretch out a little when doing cuts.  Other than that, the wide base and materials around the ankle had me feeling safe and secure."
10549,240,522,7.0,2020-01-02,support,The woven upper material doesn't provide much lockdown and the heel counter feels pretty flimsy.
10550,240,33,9.0,2019-12-17,fit,Once I went down 1/2 size the lockdown was damn near perfect. From heel to toe and from medial to lateral side — just solid all around.
10551,240,6,9.0,2019-11-20,fit,There was no dead space in the toe box and the one-bootie upper hugged my feet nicely.
10552,240,293,8.0,2019-11-06,fit,"For my feet, the fit wasn't the best. It probably works best for wide and thick feet."
10553,240,522,8.0,2020-01-02,fit,Overall the fit is good. No issues here.
10554,240,293,100.0,2019-11-06,outdoor,"The rubber is really hard and the grooves are deep, you shouldn't have a problem playing outdoors."
10555,240,293,4,2019-11-06,width,There is a good amount of extra toe space.
10556,240,522,3,2020-01-02,width,I went standard width since and it was plenty of space width-wise even with my wide feet.
10557,240,6,4,2019-11-20,size,Going down half a size is the way to go!
10558,240,293,4,2019-11-06,size,I suggest going down half a size.
10559,240,522,4,2020-01-02,size,Go down half a size.
10560,241,33,9.1,2019-11-19,expert_overall,The Nike Kyrie 6 is a great shoe and an evolution of the Kyrie 5 with a few small improvements that are noticeable once you play in them.
10561,241,86,9.1,2019-11-27,expert_overall,"If you liked the Kyrie 4 or 5, you are going to love the Kyrie 6!"
10562,241,6,9.0,2019-11-28,expert_overall,"For $130, I would highly recommend getting a pair of Kyrie 6's! These are one of the best performers of the year!"
10563,241,293,8.8,2019-11-28,expert_overall,"I really liked the Kyrie 6, this shoe feels and plays like a Kyrie. The only downsides are the slight bulkiness and the traction on dusty courts."
10564,241,522,8.8,2020-04-07,expert_overall,The Kyrie 6 is one of the best all-around shoes I’ve played in for a long time. It reminds me of the Hyperdunk line as it will work for every player type.
10565,241,2,8.6,2021-05-07,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie 6 is an impressive performance shoe. It feels quick and provides great responsiveness. The cushion is bouncy in the forefoot while still feeling low to the ground, and the traction is amazing. There really aren't many weaknesses in the Kyrie 6."
10566,241,45,8.0,2019-11-20,expert_overall,We really appreciate the great traction and support and good cushioning. But fit and materials show some room for improvement.
10567,241,584,8.6,2022-03-10,user_overall,One of the best shoe I hav
10568,241,647,9.3,2022-12-10,user_overall,I like the fact that this shoe had great traction even on a dusty floor.  I really didnt hate anything about this shoe other than the strap getting clingy to the shoe laces.  Even on dusty floors it didnt pick up any dust on the sole.  This shoe could be use for anyone but mainly guards or quick bigs.  But this shoe really surprised me and it will be in my rotation.
10569,241,361,8.4,2022-01-23,user_overall,"Kyrie six is a pretty good performer for me, there’s a few minor cons to it but in my opinion, the pros in my opinion make them easy to ignore. The sizing was a little tricky, but going up half a size for me was good. I wouldn’t recommend this shoe for wide footers, if you really want them I recommend trying them on for they’re pretty narrow."
10570,241,136,9.0,2022-06-20,user_overall,"One of the best shoes I’ve ever played in. I love how it has an extra protection in the front-inside part, which will be very helpful  when you slide the back foot to stop on a dime after a crossover. Nice court feel and traction. Worst thing for me is probably the durability of the shoe, but it’s just OK."
10571,241,648,9.0,2021-10-24,user_overall,"Very good shoe for point guards, that are shifty and have a playstyle inspired by Kyrie Irving, really amazing traction with good cushion and solid support, really recommend for quick guards that like to run on fastbreaks and breake some ankles on offense."
10572,241,33,9.5,2019-11-19,traction,The traction pattern has you covered in all directions and is so tacky that I never had to wipe.
10573,241,86,9.5,2019-11-27,traction,"The traction of the Kyrie 5 was already good, but this traction is a major upgrade and has you covered no matter where or in which direction you plant your feet."
10574,241,6,9.0,2019-11-28,traction,"The multi-angle traction pattern performs freaking amazing on clean courts. On dusty courts, you will need a slight wipe from time to time. I'd rate this traction pattern #2 in the Kyrie line."
10575,241,293,8.0,2019-11-28,traction,"The traction takes a few days to break in but then you get an incredible stop on clean courts. On dusty courts, you pick up dust quickly and lose a lot of traction. The outsole is also pretty hard to wipe."
10576,241,522,9.0,2020-04-07,traction,Traction works well on every surface with minimal wiping!
10577,241,2,9.0,2021-05-07,traction,The traction was amazing and needed no break-in time. The compound is very tacky and performed great even on dusty courts.
10578,241,45,9.0,2019-11-20,traction,The super-deep grooves provide great traction on clean and even dusty courts.
10579,241,33,9.0,2019-11-19,cushion,The Nike Zoom Turbo in the forefoot and injected Phylon in the midfoot provide just enough bounce without sacrificing court feel or responsiveness.
10580,241,86,9.0,2019-11-27,cushion,"The Nike Zoom Turbo gives you smooth transitions, low ride, and responsive feedback."
10581,241,6,9.0,2019-11-28,cushion,The Nike Zoom Turbo was more pronounced than in the Kyrie 5 which I really liked. Definitely the best cushioning setup in the Kyrie line so far.
10582,241,293,9.0,2019-11-28,cushion,The Phylon feels a little softer than we are used to from other Kyrie shoes. The Nike Zoom Turbo in the forefoot feels really nice and bouncy and gives you a lot of court feel.
10583,241,522,9.0,2020-04-07,cushion,"Not too soft, not too hard, a good bit of bounce, and feedback make this a great shoe for any position."
10584,241,2,9.0,2021-05-07,cushion,Zoom Turbo in the forefoot is very prominent. The Phylon in the heel area was also adjusted to feel more comfortable. The setup is low to the ground and responsive.
10585,241,45,8.0,2019-11-20,cushion,The forefoot Nike Zoom Turbo feels great but I'd wish there was another Zoom unit in the heel.
10586,241,33,9.0,2019-11-19,materials,I like the textiles in the forefoot but I really love the soft genuine leather in the heel.
10587,241,86,9.0,2019-11-27,materials,The midfoot strap and extra leather along the midsole give it a 90s old school basketball vibe.
10588,241,6,9.0,2019-11-28,materials,I am really happy with the quality of the materials used in the Kyrie 6.
10589,241,293,9.0,2019-11-28,materials,"The mesh material is very supportive, soft and comfortable. Probably the best materials of the Kyrie line."
10590,241,522,8.0,2020-04-07,materials,Nothing ultra-fancy here but it works great.
10591,241,2,8.0,2021-05-07,materials,"Ballistic mesh is used on the upper. It's comfortable straight out of the box, but it does not stretch performance-wise. This means the sizing and fit remain consistent over time."
10592,241,45,7.0,2019-11-20,materials,The leather ob the black colorway is nice but other colorways have a synthetic material in the heel that doesn't feel nice on foot.
10593,241,33,9.0,2019-11-19,support,Support in the Kyrie 6 is pretty standard.
10594,241,86,9.0,2019-11-27,support,"360-degree traction, soft midsole, proper lockdown, an extra padded interior, and your foot sits directly on the footbed without any slippage."
10595,241,6,9.0,2019-11-28,support,"I never had any support issues with a Kyrie model, and the Kyrie 6 is no different."
10596,241,293,9.0,2019-11-28,support,Strong materials and lateral caging keep your feet locked down.
10597,241,522,9.0,2020-04-07,support,This is not a minimal-feeling shoe but the stability and support are excellent!
10598,241,2,9.0,2021-05-07,support,The midfoot strap works to keep your midfoot locked down.
10599,241,45,9.0,2019-11-20,support,This is one of the most supportive shoes for guards. You really feel 100% locked down when you lace them up.
10600,241,33,9.0,2019-11-19,fit,Lockdown was great and the lacing system worked well. I didn't feel like the straps did anything for me.
10601,241,86,9.0,2019-11-27,fit,"I couldn't find a size 13.5 so I went with a 13 and after the break-in period, the shoe still felt tight but it was bearable to the point of being able to play aggressively and not feel worrisome."
10602,241,6,9.0,2019-11-28,fit,No dead space in the forefoot and the upper hug your feet really nicely.
10603,241,293,9.0,2019-11-28,fit,"For me, the fit was perfect as it was snug and tight."
10604,241,522,9.0,2020-04-07,fit,"No heel slip, no side to side movement, and no break-in period."
10605,241,2,8.0,2021-05-07,fit,I had no issues with the fit.
10606,241,45,7.0,2019-11-20,fit,The shoe starts off really tight but once the shoe breaks in the fit feels okay.
10607,241,6,0.0,2019-11-28,outdoor,I wouldn't recommend outdoor use.
10608,241,45,50.0,2019-11-20,outdoor,I'd take them outdoors because the rubber grooves are thick and deep.
10609,241,6,2,2019-11-28,width,Slightly snug.
10610,241,293,2,2019-11-28,width,Really tight in the toe area.
10611,241,522,2,2020-04-07,width,There is a lot of padding which made the shoe feel half a size smaller.
10612,241,2,2,2021-05-07,width,People with wide feet may want to go half a size up.
10613,241,45,1,2019-11-20,width,"Really, really tight out of the box."
10614,241,6,2,2019-11-28,size,Runs a little small.
10615,241,293,2,2019-11-28,size,"I went true to size, but if you have wide feet consider going up half a size."
10616,241,522,2,2020-04-07,size,I've made do with true to size but these are definitely half a size short in length.
10617,241,2,3,2021-05-07,size,I went true to size and had no problems.
10618,241,45,3,2019-11-20,size,True to size.

10622,242,6,9.0,2019-11-06,expert_overall,This is the best performing Jordan model in the last few years - definitely worth the $180 price tag! This shoe is super fun to play in and should work for big guys as well as guards.
10623,242,649,9.0,2019-12-17,expert_overall,The AJ 34 is a great all-around shoe that’s easy to recommend for anyone willing to pay its $180 price tag.
10624,242,2,9.0,2021-05-07,expert_overall,"I really liked the Jordan34. It's one of the best Jordan's in the signature line. The forefoot is bouncy, but remains responsive. They did a very good job with materials that are not only lightweight, but also supportive."

Had to go half size up as its a bid narrow on the toebox . I have 34,35 and 38 and maybe I give it a slight edge over both 35 and 38 as it fits me very well, allows me to move freely, and are very comfy and my feet are not as tired as before. Very springy and comfy cunshioning. Definitely a steal as I found the last one online.  For sure, I recommend it . Very good shoe."

XDR is super hard but the grooves and thin and far apart, some dust pickup. materials are thin. support is everything u need, double knot the laces tho cause the lockdown is better. quite a lot of dead space in the shoe, so when your running and turning around you can roll out"
10630,242,447,9.9,2022-02-03,user_overall,"The Air Jordan 34 is a true evolution of what the flight plate and unlocked zoom air tech originated from in the Air Jordan 28. Although the eclipse plate has a break-in period and the forefoot, bottom loaded unlocked zoom air is a bit muted; this shoe is catered to almost any position and foot type. This one of my favorite Air Jordan’s from the 2010 era as this and the Air Jordan 36 have the preferences I love in a basketball shoe"
10631,242,551,8.8,2021-10-25,user_overall,"The shoe is too good. The traction and cushion is amazing. However every once in a while, I found my self slipping. The materials and light and basic but the eyelet holes liked to rip on me. Not v"
10632,242,527,8.4,2022-11-08,user_overall,"I have loved the bouncy feeling when I put them on, makes me feel like I fly. Materials are pretty breathable, yet not the most comfy fit on top of the foot. Traction is great indoors. My main issue with the shoe is the interior stitched lining across the top of the toe box. It has given me blisters on my pinky toe every time I play in them. A great shoe for limited minutes, or not a crazy explosive playing style."
10633,242,33,9.5,2019-09-19,traction,Give it a little break-in time and the herringbone traction pattern will provide a stop-on-a-dime type of grip.
10634,242,45,9.0,2019-11-13,traction,The AJ34 has low-to-zero dust collection grips the floor really well.
10635,242,293,9.0,2019-09-26,traction,"The traction is really good on clean courts. On dusty courts, you just need a slight wipe occasionally."
10636,242,6,10.0,2019-11-06,traction,"The traction is amazing, especially after the break-in period. I didn't really experience any issues even on dusty courts. Probably the best traction on a Jordan model in a long time."
10637,242,649,9.0,2019-12-17,traction,The traction pattern sticks to a tried and true herringbone-based design which offers a secure and reassuring grip.
10638,242,2,9.0,2021-05-07,traction,"After breaking them in, the traction improves a lot. They became grippier the more I played in them."
10639,242,176,9.5,2019-11-16,traction,"On four different courts, dirty and clean, the 34 was sticky stuck."
10640,242,522,9.0,2019-10-18,traction,"The thin, flexible, and slightly modified herringbone traction pattern works well on all floor conditions."
10641,242,221,9.0,2019-11-16,traction,"I would give the tacky rubber and the herringbone traction pattern and A-. On some courts, I had to wipe from time to time, but usually, I was able to stop on a dime!"
10642,242,33,10.0,2019-09-19,cushion,This is the best Zoom Air experience I've ever had! The 10mm unit in the forefoot is springy and responsive and the 14mm Hex Zoom in the heel provides a lot of impact protection.
10643,242,45,10.0,2019-11-13,cushion,"The supersized unlocked Zoom bags in the forefoot and the heel provide you with great responsiveness, court feel, and impact protection."
10644,242,293,9.0,2019-09-26,cushion,The cushioning feels incredible! The entire forefoot feels super bouncy and the heel-to-toe transition is nice and smooth. Heel compression and court feel could have been a little better.
10645,242,6,10.0,2019-11-06,cushion,The Zoom unit in the forefoot is super nice: very bouncy and feels awesome.
10646,242,649,9.0,2019-12-17,cushion,The Zoom bags combined with the Eclipse plate is a top-notch system that nails the court feel-to-impact protection ratio.
10647,242,2,10.0,2021-05-07,cushion,There is a large Zoom unit in the forefoot complimented by Jordan brands eclipse plate to allow the cushion to expand that feels amazing. It's very responsive and extremely bouncy.
10648,242,176,9.5,2019-11-16,cushion,This is the best unlocked Zoom experience since the AJ28.
10649,242,522,9.0,2019-10-18,cushion,"The Zoom cushioning isn't as plush as in other shoes, but if you want a very well-balanced and fun overall set up, you’ll really like these."
10650,242,221,10.0,2019-11-16,cushion,The huge forefoot Zoom unit feels super springy. This is in the top-3 cushion setups that I've ever used!
10651,242,33,9.0,2019-09-19,materials,"The materials are not exactly premium, but they are lightweight, flexible and breathable."
10652,242,45,9.0,2019-11-13,materials,The overall Mesh construction is super breathable and lightweight but still feels supportive enough for a performance basketball shoe.
10653,242,293,9.0,2019-09-26,materials,The materials are lightweight and super breathable but don't feel very premium in-hand.
10654,242,6,8.0,2019-11-06,materials,The full Mesh upper doesn't feel very premium but works without a flaw and is super lightweight.
10655,242,2,8.0,2021-05-07,materials,"The materials will vary depending on the colorway, but the mesh is durable and doesn't stretch much after wear."
10656,242,176,7.0,2019-11-16,materials,"The materials are nice and get the job done, but they are nothing special."
10657,242,522,8.0,2019-10-18,materials,The upper materials look cheap but play fine.  It's strong and flexible but looks somehow unfinished to me.
10658,242,221,8.0,2019-11-16,materials,The synthetic upper is very well ventilated and super lightweight. But some players might look for a more sturdy upper.
10659,242,33,9.5,2019-09-19,support,"The large heel counter provides exceptional lockdown and the Eclipse plate gives you just enough torsional rigidity. Even though this is the lightest Air Jordan so far, it's also one of the more supportive"
10660,242,45,8.0,2019-11-13,support,The support features are pretty standard but they come together really nicely with the great lacing system.
10661,242,293,9.0,2019-09-26,support,"There is no slippage on lateral cuts or in the heel. Overall, support is incredible!"
10662,242,6,9.0,2019-11-06,support,"No heel slippage, no side-to-side movement on the footbed, and no lateral or linear instabilities. This shoe has you covered!"
10663,242,649,9.0,2019-12-17,support,Top-tier heel lockdown while not restricting your movements.
10664,242,2,9.0,2021-05-07,support,The materials do a good job of providing extra support all around the shoe. The TPU plate also is great for stability. One of the best support systems offered on the market.
10665,242,176,9.0,2019-11-16,support,Great lockdown and no side-to-side sliding off of the footbed.
10666,242,522,9.0,2019-10-18,support,The Eclipse plate in the midfoot and the flat and wide base provide a ton of support and stability. The higher cut doesn't add much because the material is really thin and flexible.
10667,242,221,8.0,2019-11-16,support,Your foot sits pretty high on the eclipse plate and the upper materials is very thin and could be a little more supportive.
10668,242,33,9.0,2019-09-19,fit,The traditional lacing system allows you to adjust the fit to your feet easily.
10669,242,45,10.0,2019-11-13,fit,The fit was perfect! The lacing system really conforms to your feet and the elastic padded tongue is super comfortable.
10670,242,6,8.0,2019-11-06,fit,"Overall the fit is really good, but there is some dead space in the toe box area, especially if you really crank down the laces in the forefoot."
10671,242,649,9.0,2019-12-17,fit,"Once laced, the AJ34 has the perfect balance of support and flexibility, while still being thin and unobtrusive."
10672,242,2,9.0,2021-05-07,fit,"The fit is awesome and like the support, is one of the best available."
10673,242,176,9.0,2019-11-16,fit,"After a few wears, the upper feels like an extension of your foot."
10674,242,45,50.0,2019-11-13,outdoor,The grooves aren't super deep and won't last forever.
10675,242,293,50.0,2019-09-26,outdoor,"Probably not the best option for outdoor use, but occasional use should be okay."
10676,242,45,3,2019-11-13,width,Regular.
10677,242,293,2,2019-09-26,width,Pretty snug in the toe area but conforms nicely to wider feet.
10678,242,6,3,2019-11-06,width,I didn't have any problems as a slightly wide-footer.
10679,242,2,3,2021-05-07,width,"If you have a wide foot, you may want to go half a size up."
10680,242,522,2,2019-10-18,width,The shape of your toes will determine if you need to go a half size up.
10681,242,45,3,2019-11-13,size,Go true to size.
10682,242,293,4,2019-09-26,size,"Runs a little long. You can go down half a size if you have narrow feet, go true to size if you have regular to wide feet."
10683,242,6,3,2019-11-06,size,"Go true to size, even if you have slightly wide feet."
10684,242,2,3,2021-05-07,size,I went true to size as a regular footer.
10685,242,522,3,2019-10-18,size,I had my normal finger width of space at the toe box with true to size.
10686,243,6,9.0,2019-10-06,expert_overall,The Lebron 17 is an awesome shoe! Strongly recommended if you are looking for the best cushioning setup available and you can afford the steep $200 retail price.
10687,243,33,9.0,2019-10-11,expert_overall,"If it wasn't for the inconsistent traction I would have really enjoyed the Lebron 17. I liked everything, loved some things, but disliked the traction."
10688,243,293,8.8,2019-10-13,expert_overall,"The Lebron 17 is a great shoe - one of our favorite Lebrons. Insane impact protection, incredible traction - there's really nothing to complain about."
10689,243,45,8.8,2019-11-06,expert_overall,This might be the best shoe in the Lebron series!
10690,243,2,8.8,2021-05-07,expert_overall,The Nike LeBron 17 are very fun to play in. The combination of the traction and cushion was beastly. It is an impressive shoe 17 models into the LeBron signature lineup.
10691,243,221,7.6,2020-03-18,expert_overall,"The Lebron 17's just aren't going to be for everyone. How high you sit off of the ground is really jarring, but over time I did start to appreciate the Knitposite upper and the cushioning system that is pretty explosive. The Lebron 17 features the largest Air unit ever to be in a basketball sneaker, so if that caters to your playing styles I'd say check these out."
10692,243,587,9.2,2022-08-10,user_overall,"This shoe performs great on an indoor court and has superb cushioning and a great fit which allows for an extremely comfortable experience. If used exclusively on an indoor court there will be minimal wear, however, if used on an outdoor court for extended periods of time the sole will start to decay.I recommend this shoe for any larger players due to the size and weight of it and probably advise smaller players to stay away from it because it may be hard to do complicated and fast paced handles"
10693,243,497,8.3,2022-01-14,user_overall,"The Nike LeBron 17 is a solid shoe for forwards and bigs. It fits best for big post players. The traction is solid with a bit of slippage. The cushion was great, with good bounce and impact protection. The support was good, but I would constantly roll my ankle due to the lack of an outrigger and because of the high footbed. My foot would also slide out of the footbed. Ankle support was great, but my ankle was bothered at times. The material wasn’t too breathable but the quality was great!"
10694,243,266,9.2,2023-09-01,user_overall,"Translucent rubber grips great, definitely upper ""A"" Ti"
10695,243,456,7.7,2022-01-16,user_overall,"The traction was average and not durable at all! The cushion was probably the best part of the shoe, however I felt a little unstable on the huge air unit in the heel… I liked the materials and they are quality and all, but they were very heavy and played hot… Overall, as a guard I did not like the Lebron 17, but I could see how a post might like them…"
10696,243,433,7.2,2023-05-16,user_overall,Pros: really good looking. The upper is made of premium materials. HUGE air units provide a lot
10697,243,6,8.0,2019-10-06,traction,"On clean courts, I didn't have any issues. On dusty courts, you will need to wipe from time to time. Overall, I was really happy with the traction."
10698,243,33,7.0,2019-10-11,traction,"No matter the court, I just could never get any reliable coverage."
10699,243,293,10.0,2019-10-13,traction,The traction on the translucent pair was amazing from the getgo. The black solid rubber didn't perform as well. Dust pickup is minimal and the durability of the rubber should be good.
10700,243,45,8.0,2019-11-06,traction,The traction didn't blow me away but it did its job.
10701,243,2,8.0,2021-05-07,traction,"Performance-wise, the traction was grippy. It doesn't pick up must dust either. I had no issues with the traction."
10702,243,221,6.0,2020-03-18,traction,"The outsole for the Lebron 17 is a recipe for disaster because the traction pattern is tight, compact, and flat. I was surprised initially that the traction was really responsive, but over time the traction proved that it couldn't keep up. I had multiple instances where I was slipping and sliding no matter how many times I wiped."
10703,243,6,10.0,2019-10-06,cushion,The Lebron 17 has so much cushioning - it's crazy. Heel-to-toe transition is surprisingly good!
10704,243,33,10.0,2019-10-11,cushion,You literally feel as if you’re running around on Air. Maybe the best impact protection ever but court feel is non-existent.
10705,243,293,9.0,2019-10-13,cushion,"Even though Air Max isn't our favorite setup, the cushioning of the Lebron 17 is really nice. Impact protection is great, there's a good amount of bounce, but the court feel is lacking."
10706,243,45,9.0,2019-11-06,cushion,The huge Air Max unit in the heel and the two Zoom units in the forefoot provide crazy impact protection.
10707,243,2,10.0,2021-05-07,cushion,"Two Zoom pods in the forefoot and an Air Max bubble in the rear, I was really impressed with the cushion in the LeBron 17. It's one of the softest and plush setups on the market."
10708,243,221,9.0,2020-03-18,cushion,"The large Air Max unit in the heel couples with forefoot Max Zoom Air is a very explosive setup that is the definition of maximum cushioning. If court feel is what you're looking for these aren't gonna be it, but if you wanna have a little extra pep in your step with maximum impact protection it doesn't get any better."
10709,243,6,10.0,2019-10-06,materials,The knit upper materials are extremely nice! They feel really comfortable and provide a ton of containment.
10710,243,33,9.5,2019-10-11,materials,The Knitposite upper materials have that nice broken-in feeling fresh out the box while still offering great containment and support.
10711,243,293,9.0,2019-10-13,materials,"The materials are top-notch, really thick, and comfortable. Ventilation is non-existent, you are going to sweat in these!"
10712,243,45,9.0,2019-11-06,materials,"Knitposite material is really strong and supportive, unfortunately it's also really hot."
10713,243,2,9.0,2021-05-07,materials,The Battleknit upper really works. It feels very supportive and comfortable.
10714,243,221,8.0,2020-03-18,materials,The materials on the Lebron 17 are balanced and work well. The mid foot and the heel have Knitposite which is basically glue over a knitted material that does a fantastic job at adding more support and rigidity. The forefoot doesn't have Knitposite and is much more soft.
10715,243,6,9.0,2019-10-06,support,"No heel slippage, no side-to-side movement on the footbed, and the outriggers in the forefoot and heel provide more stability on lateral cuts than previous Lebron models."
10716,243,33,9.0,2019-10-11,support,The LeBron 17 shows that maximum cushion setups can also offer stability and support.
10717,243,293,8.0,2019-10-13,support,"No issues with lateral containment or heel slippage. Since the cushioning is really high, I felt a little unstable on lateral movements."
10718,243,45,9.0,2019-11-06,support,"The extended outrigger gives you lateral stability, the TPU barrier prevents side-to-side movements, and the heel counter keeps your feet locked down."
10719,243,2,9.0,2021-05-07,support,"The upper does an excellent job of providing support for your foot, even though LeBrons are known for being high off the ground."
10720,243,221,7.0,2020-03-18,support,"I didn't personally run into any major issues with the support system, but one thing is that it feels like you will roll your ankle in these. Nike put the largest Air unit to ever be in a basketball sneaker in the Lebron 17, so your foot is extremely high off the ground. The lateral outrigger and upper did a decent job from keeping my foot from sliding off of the footbed though."
10721,243,6,8.0,2019-10-06,fit,"There's a little bit of dead space in the toe box, other than that, the fit is really nice."
10722,243,33,9.5,2019-10-11,fit,"For my feet, the fit and lockdown were fantastic."
10723,243,293,8.0,2019-10-13,fit,The fit was rather roomy and I would have liked a little less space in the toe box. The lacing system is really annoying.
10724,243,45,9.0,2019-11-06,fit,The materials conform to your feet nicely and the lacing system works perfectly.
10725,243,2,8.0,2021-05-07,fit,"Since there isn't much stretch in the shoe after breaking in, I went down half a size to get more support from the upper hugging my foot."
10726,243,221,8.0,2020-03-18,fit,"The fit is pretty solid - the mid foot is great, the forefoot is awesome, and the heel lockdown is fantastic. I do have a problem with lacing system though because Nike used a huge overlay on the tongue that makes the laces go underneath it, so it was really hard to adjust."
10727,243,293,50.0,2019-10-13,outdoor,Playing outdoors should be fine.
10728,243,45,0.0,2019-11-06,outdoor,This shoe should not be played outdoors as the rubber will not last very long.
10729,243,293,4,2019-10-13,width,The fit is wide-foot-friendly.
10730,243,45,3,2019-11-06,width,The width of the shoe is regular and should fit everybody.
10731,243,293,3,2019-10-13,size,Go true to size.
10732,243,45,3,2019-11-06,size,True to size.
10733,244,365,9.2,2019-10-10,expert_overall,"The Harden Vol. 4 is fast, controlled, and has been a personal joy to play in. In my personal experience, this is a top performer!"
10734,244,176,9.1,2019-12-20,expert_overall,"The Harden Vol. 4 is a nice shoe - the traction is good on most surfaces, Lightstrike works but isn’t overly bouncy or plush, and fit and support are good. But overall,  I can't help but feel the Harden Vol.4 took a step back from the Vol.3."
10735,244,293,8.8,2019-10-06,expert_overall,The Adidas Harden Vol. 4 is a really good performer! A perfect shoe for guards looking for a low-to-the-ground and supportive basketball shoe.
10736,244,522,8.8,2019-11-03,expert_overall,"I think this is the best Harden so far! Outstanding traction when clean, great fit right out of the box, very stable and $10 cheaper than the V3."
10737,244,33,8.7,2019-10-10,expert_overall,I loved everything about the Harden 4 except the Lightstrike cushioning which was a little too soft and the elastic band in the midfoot which felt a little too tight and snug.
10738,244,45,8.6,2019-11-18,expert_overall,"I am not a low-top fan, but this is the best low-top I've played in a long time!"
10739,244,2,8.6,2021-05-07,expert_overall,"The Adidas Harden Vol. 4 is a great performer. Adidas used something other than Boost for the first time in a Harden shoe, and the Lightstrike actually felt good. It's lighter than Boost but still felt bouncy. Combined with its consistent traction and solid fit, the Harden Vol. 4 doesn't disappoint."
10740,244,6,8.4,2019-11-19,expert_overall,"I really enjoyed playing in the Harden Vol. 4. If you are not looking for a ton of impact protection, this is a great performer!"
10741,244,320,9.0,2023-05-01,user_overall,"This is one of my favorite hoop shoes of all time. The traction is good, with hard, thick grooves that should hold up outdoors. The support is good, despite the pointless strap, and the tpu counter locks my heel in. The materials are very soft and comfy, but they sacrifice some breathability. Finally, the fully exposed Lightstrike is the best part of the shoe. It is soft & plush, but also responsive. However, it bottoms out very quickly. Still a must have shoe, that’s essentially a Adidas Kobe."
10742,244,650,9.5,2022-03-20,user_overall,"At the beginning the midfoot band chokes your foot, but after a week or two it breaks it in. Perfect for outdoor, very durable also for toe drags. After a year of playing the knit started tearing off, but it's fine. The outsole started to wear out after two months of intensive outdoor use (from 3 to 5 hours every day). So I recommend the outdoor use for this shoe. Great look by the way, one of the best in harden's line"
10743,244,396,8.4,2021-11-09,user_overall,"Reporting on Chinese New Year colorway which might be significantly different. Super premium upper materials, less padding inside. Played in them once, noticed that Lightstrike feels different comparing to Next Level; not that thick, not that responsive, on a softer side. I wear 11.5 and those shoes were really long for me. Presented them to my friend who wears 13 and it was a perfect fit for him (yikes, Adidas!)"
10744,244,504,8.2,2022-01-05,user_overall,"The harden vol. 4 was a great shoe for me. The traction was amazing, the cushion was great. Also the break in period is at most only maybe 3 pick ups games and its broke in. The laces at first come undone often but fine after a while. I don't know if the colorway had anything to do with it but after 4 months of main playing the shoe the translucent outsole peeled off a inch or so under the shoe..."
10745,244,480,8.4,2021-11-25,user_overall,"The traction on colorways with the translucent outsole was super squeaky and had an insane bite, but the colorways with the solid rubber outsole were inconsistent and picked up dust easily. The lightstrike in the heel was very soft, yet firm in the forefoot (a little too firm sometimes). The materials were okay, and the support was there."
10746,244,365,9.5,2019-10-10,traction,Traction on the Harden Vol. 4 is crazy. I rarely had to wipe at all.
10747,244,176,9.0,2019-12-20,traction,"The traction is not a dead stop, break-your-own-ankles grip, but more of a smooth stop and release."
10748,244,293,8.0,2019-10-06,traction,"Really good bite on clean courts, but the traction pattern picks up dust quickly."
10749,244,522,9.0,2019-11-03,traction,The traction is excellent when clean or freshly wiped and still good enough on dusty courts.
10750,244,33,9.0,2019-10-10,traction,The traction pattern doesn't look impressive but just works. On really bad floors I just wiped every-so-often and I was on my way.
10751,244,45,8.0,2019-11-18,traction,"The traction sucks the court nicely but needs wiping on dusty courts. Fortunately, this is a wipe-friendly shoe."
10752,244,2,9.0,2021-05-07,traction,"Traction needs a light wipe every now and then, but it performs consistently well on all court conditions. Even with the wiping, it still gripped the dustier courts."
10753,244,6,9.0,2019-11-19,traction,"On clean courts, the traction is awesome. On dusty courts, you will just need to wipe from time to time, and you're good to go. For some reason, the traction was much better on the translucent rubber version."
10754,244,365,9.5,2019-10-10,cushion,The Lightstrike cushioning feels leaps and bounds better than most foams I've experienced in basketball shoes.
10755,244,176,9.0,2019-12-20,cushion,The Lightstrike heel foam is thick and soft in the heel and thin and stiff in the forefoot.
10756,244,293,9.0,2019-10-06,cushion,"The Lightstrike cushioning provides amazing court feel, a slight bounce, and good impact protection."
10757,244,522,9.0,2019-11-03,cushion,The Lightstrike cushioning is a very comfortable foam that plays low-to-the-ground.
10758,244,33,7.0,2019-10-10,cushion,The new Lightstrike cushioning feels a little too soft for me.
10759,244,45,9.0,2019-11-18,cushion,I loved the Lightstrike cushioning! A lot of foam in the heel for impact protection and a little less foam in the forefoot for more responsiveness and court feel.
10760,244,2,9.0,2021-05-07,cushion,"For the first time in a Harden shoe, the cushion is not Boost. I like the newly implemented Lightstrike. It feels like a marriage of Boost and Bounce. It has the bounciness of Boost and the responsiveness of Bounce."
10761,244,6,8.0,2019-11-19,cushion,"You get a nice chunk of Lightstrike cushioning in the heel, in the forefoot I would have liked a little more cushioning. If you like court feel and responsiveness, this shoe has you covered."
10762,244,365,9.0,2019-10-10,materials,The Primeknit upper and synthetic overlays worked extremely well for me personally.
10763,244,176,9.5,2019-12-20,materials,"The materials of this colorway (SKU F97187) feel crazy premium for a modern basketball shoe,"
10764,244,293,9.0,2019-10-06,materials,"The upper materials are soft, comfortable, but not super supportive."
10765,244,522,8.0,2019-11-03,materials,"Nothing offensive or outstanding about the materials, pretty much par for the price."
10766,244,33,9.0,2019-10-10,materials,Break-in time is quick and painless.
10767,244,45,9.0,2019-11-18,materials,"Suede, mesh, leather, and elastic synthetics, and they all do their thing in the most amazing way! Arguably the most comfortable Harden shoe I've played in."
10768,244,2,9.0,2021-05-07,materials,"The upper is mostly made up of synthetic materials, but they perform very nicely."
10769,244,6,9.0,2019-11-19,materials,The full-textile upper materials feel premium and much-improved from the Harden 3.
10770,244,365,9.0,2019-10-10,support,"The wide base, low profile and strong caging provide a ton of support."
10771,244,176,9.0,2019-12-20,support,"Support is good thanks to a wide base, stiff midfoot, raised lateral sidewalls, and strong heel counter."
10772,244,293,9.0,2019-10-06,support,"Great lockdown, very good lateral containment, and the low-to-the-ground and wide base provides a ton of stability."
10773,244,522,9.0,2019-11-03,support,The very wide base is great for stability and safety.
10774,244,33,9.5,2019-10-10,support,The low-to-the-ground setup really gradles your foot and the lacing system locks you in tightly.
10775,244,45,8.0,2019-11-18,support,"The support comes from the wide lateral outrigger, the great overall fit, and lockdown of the lacing system, and the internal TPU counter. For a low-top, this is a very supportive shoe."
10776,244,2,8.0,2021-05-07,support,The shoe is very supportive and well contained. I had no issues with support.
10777,244,6,8.0,2019-11-19,support,I didn't have any heel slippage or side-to-side movements on the footbed and the torsional rigidity was good.
10778,244,365,9.0,2019-10-10,fit,Exceptional midfoot lockdown and no movement in the front.
10779,244,176,9.0,2019-12-20,fit,
10780,244,293,9.0,2019-10-06,fit,The shoe is super easy to get on and comfortable to play-in.
10781,244,522,9.0,2019-11-03,fit,Zero heel slip or overall movement inside of the shoe.
10782,244,33,9.0,2019-10-10,fit,The elastic band area led to cramps in my feet during the first wear but it's gotten much better since then.
10783,244,45,9.0,2019-11-18,fit,It's a great-fitting shoe!
10784,244,2,8.0,2021-05-07,fit,The Harden Vol. 4 fits great if you get the right size. It feels like it's hugging your foot.
10785,244,6,8.0,2019-11-19,fit,"There was some pain in the forefoot in the beginning, but after the initial break-in, the fit got really good."
10786,244,293,50.0,2019-10-06,outdoor,The rubber is pretty thick and hard.
10787,244,45,100.0,2019-11-18,outdoor,I would definitely take them outdoors.
10788,244,293,3,2019-10-06,width,It starts off slightly narrow in the beginning but breaks in nicely.
10789,244,522,2,2019-11-03,width,The shoe fits very snugly and due to all the padding.
10790,244,2,4,2021-05-07,width,Wide-footers should be good to go true to size.
10791,244,6,2,2019-11-19,width,A little bit narrow in the forefoot around the pinkie toe.
10792,244,293,3,2019-10-06,size,Go true to your Adidas size.
10793,244,522,4,2019-11-03,size,They run a tad bit long.
10794,244,45,3,2019-11-18,size,Treu to size.
10795,244,2,4,2021-05-07,size,"I have a regular shaped foot, and half a size down was good for me."
10796,244,6,4,2019-11-19,size,Runs a little bit long.
10797,245,33,8.2,2019-12-17,expert_overall,"The D Rose 10 is much better than the D Rose 9 and will make any Derrick Rose fan happy. But if you are looking for the best bang-for-the buck shoes, there are much better options out there."
10798,245,6,8.0,2019-10-10,expert_overall,"Me personally, for $140, I wouldn't pick these up because there are much better performers in the same price range."
10799,245,293,7.6,2019-10-21,expert_overall,$140 for budget tech - I don't think the D Rose 10 is a good deal.  The only thing I really liked about these shoes is the cushioning. I won't be playing a lot in the D Rose 10.
10800,245,558,8.8,2022-02-18,user_overall,"I liked the design, color, and materials. I recommend players that like comfort and forwards. The one I bought though wasn't full leather which was disappointing but in the end it is a really great shoe to have on a clean court."
10801,245,33,7.0,2019-12-17,traction,The herringbone and radial pattern are so tightly spaced that even the smallest amount of dust will accumulate.
10802,245,6,8.0,2019-10-10,traction,The traction is really nice on clean courts. On dusty courts you will have the occasional slip up because the outsole attracts a lot of dust.
10803,245,293,7.0,2019-10-21,traction,"The traction is really good on clean courts, but on dusty courts, I couldn't wipe hard enough to get good traction."
10804,245,33,9.0,2019-12-17,cushion,"The Bounce cushioning feels less plush than we are used to, but it still gives you a good balance of cushion and court feel."
10805,245,6,9.0,2019-10-10,cushion,I really enjoyed the Bounce cushioning that provides a lot of bounce and impact protection in the heel and more court feel in the forefoot.
10806,245,293,10.0,2019-10-21,cushion,The full-length Bounce cushioning is incredibly soft and comfortable. This is one of my favorite cushioning setups!
10807,245,33,9.0,2019-12-17,materials,This full-grain leather makes for a really premium-feeling shoe straight out the box along with a fairly fast break-in period.
10808,245,6,8.0,2019-10-10,materials,The old-school (synthetic?) leather upper feels really nice but is a little heavy and not very well ventilated.
10809,245,293,7.0,2019-10-21,materials,"The upper looks like it's where Adidas cut costs. On foot, it feels pretty nice, but the lather is pretty heavy and thick compared to other modern performance materials."
10810,245,33,9.0,2019-12-17,support,The support is just enough to keep you safe and secure while playing.
10811,245,6,8.0,2019-10-10,support,"No heel slippage, no side-to-side movement on the footbed and the Bounce cushioning acts as a lateral outrigger."
10812,245,293,8.0,2019-10-21,support,Very wide base and a solid amount of ankle protection.
10813,245,33,7.0,2019-12-17,fit,The material stretches out after a few wears and the midsole doesn't provide as much lockdown as I would have liked.
10814,245,6,7.0,2019-10-10,fit,The tongue did fold over itself occasionally and there was some dead space in the forefoot.
10815,245,293,6.0,2019-10-21,fit,"The fit was very long, slightly wide and very uncomfortable around the Achilles."
10816,245,293,0.0,2019-10-21,outdoor,The rubber is soft so I guess the durability wouldn't be the best outdoors.
10817,245,293,4,2019-10-21,width,Pretty wide.
10818,245,6,5,2019-10-10,size,"Go down half a size if you have slightly wide feet. If your feet are narrow, you might be able to go down a full size."
10819,245,293,5,2019-10-21,size,"Really, really long! Go down half a size from your Adidas size."
10820,246,33,9.2,2019-10-24,expert_overall,"The ANTA KT signature line is very consistent, similar to Nike's Kobe signature line. Even with changing aesthetics, the performance of the shoe remains very similar. The KT5's highlights are traction and cushioning, but overall stability and fit are great as well. If you like these I would definitely recommend them as they should work great for any position or style of play."
10821,246,2,8.6,2021-05-07,expert_overall,"For the price, the Anta KT5 is a great performing sneaker. It offers quite the bang for your buck with excellent cushion and traction. The materials are also comfortable and help provide solid support."
10822,246,293,8.5,2019-10-10,expert_overall,For $130 you're getting good materials and a comfortable signature shoe with the Anta KT 5 that is a very good overall performer. There are no real weaknesses and I really enjoyed playing in it!

10826,246,33,9.5,2019-10-24,traction,The multi-directional fingerprint traction pattern works for any style of play and it doesn't matter which way you plant your foot because the traction is there.
10827,246,2,9.0,2021-05-07,traction,There's no break-in time needed. It grips both clean and dusty courts.
10828,246,293,9.0,2019-10-10,traction,"The fingerprint traction is reminiscent of the KT 3 and 4 and has a really good stop on a clean court. They pick up a little dust, but a slight wipe and you should be good to go. Overall really good traction and almost top tier."
10829,246,33,9.5,2019-10-24,cushion,The smooth and stable A-Flash foam cushion has a good balance of court feel and impact protection and should be able to cater to most types of players.
10830,246,2,9.0,2021-05-07,cushion,The Anta KT5 has full-length A-Flash foam in the midsole and it feels more plush than the foam used in the KT4. It is both responsive and bouncy.
10831,246,293,8.0,2019-10-10,cushion,"The cushioning is full-length Flash Foam that has a good amount of heel compression and feels plush, but not crazy bouncy. The forefoot is pretty dead, but there is good court feel because it is low to the ground. Overall a really good cushion setup that is comfortable and responsive."
10832,246,33,9.0,2019-10-24,materials,"The knit starts off slightly firm and crispy because there is a lot of glue that adds strength and support. After breaking in, materials retain their strength but feel much more natural."
10833,246,2,8.0,2021-05-07,materials,"The upper features a textile mesh. It feels comfortable out of the box, needs no break-in time, and doesn't stretch much over time. On the downside, the shroud is purely aesthetic and adds a bit of weight to the shoe."
10834,246,293,8.0,2019-10-10,materials,"The knit upper is pretty soft, thick, and conforms to your foot well. There is a shroud that covers the laces, but it doesn't do much besides hold your laces in place. One thing we didn't like it that this shoe definitely lacks ventilation and is very hot to play in. Overall these materials are really nice considering the $130 price tag."
10835,246,33,9.0,2019-10-24,support,"The support on the KT5 was solid with a good outrigger, internal heel counter, flat base, and really good torsional shank. The external heel counter is made of rubber it is more decorative than it is functional."
10836,246,2,9.0,2021-05-07,support,"The outsole rises up the sides of the shoe to help the upper in providing stability to the shoe. When fully laced, my ankle also feels very protected."
10837,246,293,9.0,2019-10-10,support,The support on the KT 5 is very nice and has good lateral containment from caging in the toe and mid foot. There is an internal TPU counter so we felt no heel slippage and you feel really locked down into the shoe. These also have good ankle protection because of the overall height.
10838,246,33,9.0,2019-10-24,fit,"The KT5 feels near perfect on-foot, the lockdown was solid and the traditional lacing works well. The collar height was a bit too tall for me and felt restrictive and cumbersome at times."
10839,246,2,8.0,2021-05-07,fit,It fits similarly to the KT4 with the materials accommodating your feet nicely.
10840,246,2,50.0,2021-05-07,outdoor,"The fingerprint pattern has thick rubber, so it should be ok outdoors."
10841,246,293,100.0,2019-10-10,outdoor,Durability on the thick rubber seems really good and you're definitely gonna be able to play in these outdoors.
10842,246,2,3,2021-05-07,width,This shoe is wide-footer friendly.
10843,246,293,3,2019-10-10,width,If you have a wide foot true to size should be good for you.
10844,246,2,4,2021-05-07,size,It runs a little bit big. I would go half a size down if you have a regular shaped foot.
10845,246,293,4,2019-10-10,size,These run a little long so I'd recommend going down half a size.
10846,247,293,8.0,2019-10-11,expert_overall,"The Lebron Witness 4 is a very solid performer - especially for $100. If the traction was a little better, this would be a complete banger!"
10847,247,6,7.6,2019-10-11,expert_overall,"For a $100 you get a decent performer, but even at this price range there are much better shoes out there. I didn't like the cushioning and had some issues with the traction - I can't really recommend these."
10848,247,350,8.9,2023-04-08,user_overall,The shoe is very good the traction was insane and i didn't slip at all on dusty courts it picks up but can be easily removed cushion was hard on the heel but the rest was perfect it has alot of support specialy for me who has ankle problems it held it well overall good shoe for it's price even tho I bought it overpriced in saudi
10849,247,258,8.0,2023-10-28,user_overall,So I've been hearing a lot of bad reviews about these. They aren't that bad. Traction takes break in time. Materials feel cheap. However the support is great as well as durability. For the price it is not bad.
10850,247,433,7.6,2023-05-16,user_overall,"Pros: very cheap Air shoe, with good support and okay traction. Serves me w"
10851,247,653,8.8,2022-11-07,user_overall,"Got them for 70 dollars at a Nike Shop, and I've had them for multiple years. Play really well with my wide feet."
10852,247,604,7.4,2024-04-10,user_overall,"It’s not that good of a shoe , I wouldn’t recommend it ,there are better shoes when your on a budget"
10853,247,293,8.0,2019-10-11,traction,The black outsole doesn't bite crazy hard and picks up some dust. Overall the traction is not amazing but definitely doable.
10854,247,6,7.0,2019-10-11,traction,The traction in the forefoot was just fine. When planting the whole foot on lateral cuts I felt the heel sliding out at times.
10855,247,293,9.0,2019-10-11,cushion,"Heel-to-toe transition is pretty smooth, the Phylon in the heel has a nice compression and the Zoom unit in the forefoot is pretty bouncy."
10856,247,6,7.0,2019-10-11,cushion,The foam in the heel is pretty stiff and I couldn't feel the Zoom units in the forefoot like I did in the Lebron 17.
10857,247,293,7.0,2019-10-11,materials,The upper is made from a pretty crappy-looking Mesh material. Comfort and on-foot performance  is solid
10858,247,6,8.0,2019-10-11,materials,The materials are definitely not premium and feel cheapish in-hand. But the materials get the job done - I didn't have any issues on-foot.
10859,247,293,8.0,2019-10-11,support,Even though upper is a little flimsy I didn't have any issues on lateral cuts.
10860,247,6,8.0,2019-10-11,support,I didn't have any heel slippage or side-to-side movements on the footbed.
10861,247,293,8.0,2019-10-11,fit,Super easy to get on.
10862,247,6,8.0,2019-10-11,fit,"The one-bootie upper might make it difficult for wide-footers to get into the shoe and I experienced a little bit of dead space in the toe box. Other than that, the fit was solid."
10863,247,6,1,2019-10-11,width,As a slightly wide-footer the shoe fit very snug which caused some pinching pain.
10864,247,6,4,2019-10-11,size,Runs slightly long.
10865,248,365,9.0,2019-11-27,expert_overall,The Jumpman 2020 offers signature-worthy performance for a much lower price.
10866,248,293,8.4,2019-11-27,expert_overall,"For $110, this is a really good performer - highly recommended! Just watch out if you are playing a lot on really dusty courts."
10867,248,6,8.2,2019-11-27,expert_overall,"For $110, this is a really nice performance basketball shoe! The traction is solid on clean courts and the cushioning was surprisingly good."

10869,248,402,8.6,2021-11-22,user_overall,"Jordan Jumpman 2020's traction is only good on clean courts. If you play on dusty or outdoor courts, I don't recommend these. Cushioning is awesome with a large forefoot zoom unit and soft foam at the heel. Zoom unit feels really bouncy while foam gives you impact protection. Fit and Support are above average. Materials are not that good but also not that bad. Overally, Jordan Jumpman 2020 is a great choice for affordable price."

10873,248,365,9.0,2019-11-27,traction,The traditional herringbone traction pattern has been super reliable indoors and outdoors.
10874,248,293,8.0,2019-11-27,traction,"The traction is really squeaky and stops really well on clean courts. On dusty courts, I experienced some sliding, especially on linear movements while lateral movements were fine."
10875,248,6,8.0,2019-11-27,traction,"On clean courts, you get a super aggressive bite. On dusty courts, you tend to slide a little bit especially if you let too much dust accumulate on the outsole."
10876,248,365,9.0,2019-11-27,cushion,I had a great experience with transition and response of the forefoot Zoom in the Jumpman 2020.
10877,248,293,10.0,2019-11-27,cushion,The cushioning is definitely the highlight of this shoe. The Phylon in the heel is soft and provides a ton of impact protection and the Zoom in the forefoot gives you a really nice bounce.
10878,248,6,9.0,2019-11-27,cushion,The Phylon foam in the heel is really nice and soft and the forefoot Zoom is not overly bouncy but gives you great court feel and responsiveness.
10879,248,365,9.0,2019-11-27,materials,"The mesh material feels a bit cheap but it's lightweight, durable and supportive."
10880,248,293,8.0,2019-11-27,materials,The upper feels like a really flimsy mesh in-hand but on-foot the materials feel pretty thin and comfortable.
10881,248,6,8.0,2019-11-27,materials,The full-mesh build doesn't feel super premium but it gets the job done!
10882,248,365,9.0,2019-11-27,support,I particularly enjoyed the cabling of the lacing system that keeps your feet nicely on the footbed.
10883,248,293,8.0,2019-11-27,support,"I was stable on lateral movements, and there was no heel slippage."
10884,248,6,8.0,2019-11-27,support,"No heel slippage, no side-to-side movement on the footbed and no instabilities on lateral movement."
10885,248,365,9.0,2019-11-27,fit,The fit of the Jumpman 2020 feels forgiving while still being able to tighten things down.

10893,249,33,9.2,2019-08-22,expert_overall,The Nike Zoom Rize is an outstanding shoe that works for all types of players.
10894,249,2,9.0,2021-05-07,expert_overall,"Overall, the Nike Zoom Rize is a great performer that is definitely worth the price. You get a very nice cushion setup, amazing traction, and solid support."
10895,249,6,8.8,2019-08-23,expert_overall,I would highly recommend the Nike Zoom Rize. I really loved the traction and especially the cushioning - this is the best implementation of Zoom and Phylon ever!
10896,249,293,8.4,2019-08-22,expert_overall,"I really enjoyed playing in the Nike Zoom Rize because of the good traction and amazing cushioning. This shoe will work very well for big guys, but for my style of play, the court feel could have been a little better and the shoe was a little too bulky."
10897,249,588,9.7,2022-03-12,user_overall,"These are some of my favorite shoes to play in. Great balance in the heel cushioning with a very springy forefoot zoom. Traction takes a bit to break in but once it does it’s superb. I had some rubbing sometimes in the heel, but had to mess around with the lacing a bit and there wasn’t a problem. These are really good outdoors too, but they don’t last as long as I would like."
10898,249,429,8.8,2022-01-18,user_overall,"This shoe surprised me. This shoe is great at everything. This is one of the most versatile shoes I have ever had. Tacky grip, pillowy cushion setup, reliable support, great fit, and soft materials, this shoe is worth your money. It is a little bit heavy, so guards beware, but overall amazing shoe"
10899,249,517,9.8,2022-10-06,user_overall,"These are the best basketball shoes I've ever had. Great traction, great fit, good support, very durable. I've had them for 3 years (!!!) and the shoes are still in a good shape except the pattern at the bottom has worn out now. I would definitely buy them again"
10900,249,658,9.4,2022-07-09,user_overall,"These are perfect for big men and players who like high top shoes and good ankle support, these are good performers indoors and outdoors. Highly recommend"
10901,249,406,9.0,2021-11-16,user_overall,Amazing shoe. The zoom air cushioning is amazing and I like how they added the grip at the inner side of the shoe.
10902,249,33,9.5,2019-08-22,traction,"Very good groove spacing, and just the right amount of tread depth."
10903,249,2,9.0,2021-05-07,traction,The traction surprised me by performing much better than anticipated. It was gripping well on dirtier courts.
10904,249,6,9.0,2019-08-23,traction,"After the break-in period, the traction got really, really good, even on dustier courts."
10905,249,293,8.0,2019-08-22,traction,"Really, really good on clean courts, okay on dusty courts, but you will need to wipe."
10906,249,33,9.5,2019-08-22,cushion,The 10mm Zoom unit feels like a trampoline under your feet.
10907,249,2,9.0,2021-05-07,cushion,There is a Zoom unit in the forefoot area that is encased in an injected Phylon carrier. The shoe becomes bouncier over time as the cushion breaks in. As always Zoom provides plenty of impact protection.
10908,249,6,9.0,2019-08-23,cushion,The giant Nike Zoom unit in the forefoot is super bouncy but you do lose a little bit of court feel.
10909,249,293,9.0,2019-08-22,cushion,The forefoot Zoom unit reminds me of the Lebron 16 - super bouncy but court feel is not great. The foam in the heel feels great and the heel-to-toe transition is good too.
10910,249,33,9.0,2019-08-22,materials,"The Mesh and synthetic materials are strong, durable, and break-in nicely."
10911,249,2,9.0,2021-05-07,materials,An engineered mesh upper provides good durability.
10912,249,6,9.0,2019-08-23,materials,The materials feel a little crispy in the beginning but get softer quickly.
10913,249,293,8.0,2019-08-22,materials,The materials started off a little stiff but loosened up quickly.
10914,249,33,9.0,2019-08-22,support,"The wide base, supportive upper, and lacing system provide all the support you need."
10915,249,2,9.0,2021-05-07,support,The upper is very supportive from the forefoot all the way back to the ankle area. The lateral outrigger and wide base of the outsole also do a great job of providing stability.
10916,249,6,8.0,2019-08-23,support,"No heel slippage, great lockdown, but I experienced slight movements on the footbed on super hard cuts."
10917,249,293,8.0,2019-08-22,support,The materials are very supportive but lateral support in the forefoot could be better.
10918,249,33,9.0,2019-08-22,fit,Really easy to customize your fit by loosening up laces in specific areas.
10919,249,2,9.0,2021-05-07,fit,The fit is nice and offers plenty of room for you to make adjustments.
10920,249,6,9.0,2019-08-23,fit,The lacing system really hugs your feet and provides a great 1:1 fit
10921,249,293,9.0,2019-08-22,fit,The fit is incredible for my slightly narrow feet.
10922,249,2,100.0,2021-05-07,outdoor,"Even though I didn't have the XDR outsole, it is still a thick rubber outsole. It should be good for outdoors."
10923,249,293,50.0,2019-08-22,outdoor,Deep grooves and hard rubber - outdoor use should be adequate.
10924,249,2,2,2021-05-07,width,It is a bit narrow in the forefoot area.
10925,249,6,2,2019-08-23,width,"A little snug in the beginning but as a slightly wide-footer, I had no issues at all after the break-in period."
10926,249,293,2,2019-08-22,width,Slightly snug fit.

10930,250,33,8.7,2019-09-12,expert_overall,"I enjoyed the Kobe AD NXT FastFit much more than I expected. The shape of the outsole is more traditional compared to the Kobe AD NXT 360, the traction durability is better, and the Fast Fit system improves upon the AJ 33."
10931,250,32,8.5,2019-09-04,expert_overall,"You are getting nice materials, futuristic tech, comfort, and great lockdown. But $200 is just too expensive."
10932,250,293,8.4,2019-09-06,expert_overall,"For $200, the Kobe AD NXT FastFit is a pass. It's a nice shoe to play in and looks really, really good, but the performance isn't worth $200."

10937,250,33,9.5,2019-09-12,traction,Traction is aggressive and works well even on dusty courts thanks to the wide grooves of the traction pattern.
10938,250,32,9.0,2019-09-04,traction,The traction is really good on clean courts and is more durable than the Kobe AD NXT 360.
10939,250,293,9.0,2019-09-06,traction,"The fully-translucent nub traction pattern. On a clean court, the grip is amazing. On dusty courts,  you will need to wipe but the traction is still good."
10940,250,6,10.0,2019-09-12,traction,The traction is freakin amazing - you will stop on a dime!
10941,250,33,9.0,2019-09-12,cushion,"The full-length React drop-in midsole is a little firmer and more responsive than the setup of the Kobe AD NXT 360, but there was still more than enough impact protection."
10942,250,32,8.0,2019-09-04,cushion,"The cushioning gives you a spongy, squishy and comfortable feeling but I would have like a more responsive and bouncy setup."
10943,250,293,8.0,2019-09-06,cushion,"You are low-to-the-ground and the court feel is great. Impact protection could be better, especially in the forefoot. Overall, I would have liked a little more bounce."
10944,250,6,8.0,2019-09-12,cushion,"The cushion is a nice blend between court feel and impact protection, but not as comfortable as in the Kobe AD NXT 360."
10945,250,33,7.0,2019-09-12,materials,The spandex overlay is super minimal and made me be a bit hesitant to go full-speed at first.
10946,250,32,8.0,2019-09-04,materials,"The Quad Fit Mesh upper is really thin, stretchy and breathable, and looks super futuristic. The padding around the ankle is thick and comfortable."
10947,250,293,8.0,2019-09-06,materials,"The materials are super thin and minimal,  but for $200 I would have expected more premium materials."
10948,250,6,8.0,2019-09-12,materials,"The materials are really light, thin, and feel great on-foot."
10949,250,33,9.0,2019-09-12,support,The support was a pleasant surprise and worked really well considering the minimal build.
10950,250,32,7.0,2019-09-04,support,"Overall, I was a little bummed out by the support."
10951,250,293,9.0,2019-09-06,support,No issues with lateral containment and ankle support is good.
10952,250,6,7.0,2019-09-12,support,"Overall the support is pretty good. There is no heel slippage, but the bite of the traction is so good that I experienced some lateral sliding on the footbed."
10953,250,33,9.0,2019-09-12,fit,"The Fast Fit system worked perfectly for me, much better than in the Air Jordan 33."
10954,250,32,9.0,2019-09-04,fit,A simple pull of the FastFit system will lock down your entire foot.
10955,250,293,8.0,2019-09-06,fit,The strap around the ankle area is not very comfortable and the FastFit system works well but doesn't tighten the forefoot as much as the midfoot.
10956,250,6,9.0,2019-09-12,fit,"The FastFit system really works, and the materials conform nicely to your foot."
10957,250,293,0.0,2019-09-06,outdoor,I wouldn't recommend playing outdoors.
10958,250,293,1,2019-09-06,width,"This is the most narrow shoe I have ever worn, but the materials stretch and soften up easily."

10961,251,6,7.6,2019-09-04,expert_overall,$180 is a huge price for an average performer like that. The traction is just too bad - I can't recommend the Nike AlphaDunk.
10962,251,32,7.5,2019-09-16,expert_overall,The Nike AlphaDunk is not a good performance basketball shoe! This shoe is way too bulky and the traction is horrible. I can only recommend this shoe to slow and heavy big guys.
10963,251,293,7.4,2019-09-04,expert_overall,"No! Don't get it! Especially for $180, this is a no go. The traction was just horrible and I don't like the aesthetics either."
10964,251,659,7.8,2022-11-08,user_overall,"In conclusion, pretty good shoe, it's definitely NOT for outdoors especially rough ones. Picks up pretty a lot of dust you need to clean it often. It's very bulky and chunky so It's probably not for shifty players, more for big men. overall 7.8/10"
10965,251,6,5.0,2019-09-04,traction,I've played over two weeks in the AlphaDunk and the traction is just really bad and picks up a lot of dust.
10966,251,32,5.0,2019-09-16,traction,The traction is worse than horrible! I really didn't want to play in these because I was afraid of hurting myself.
10967,251,293,5.0,2019-09-04,traction,"On clean courts the traction is good but I experienced a little bit of sliding on straight movements. On dusty courts, this shoe sucks!"
10968,251,6,8.0,2019-09-04,cushion,"The cushion is really nice and bouncy, but you lose a little bit of court feel. If you are looking for impact protection, this shoe has you covered!"
10969,251,32,8.0,2019-09-16,cushion,Double-stacked Zoom in the heel and a huge Zoom Air unit in the forefoot. I would have preferred more court feel and heel-to-toe transition.
10970,251,293,9.0,2019-09-04,cushion,"The extremely large forefoot Zoom unit is super bouncy and feels really comfortable. Great impact protection, okay responsiveness, but you don't get a lot of court feel."
10971,251,6,8.0,2019-09-04,materials,The upper material is comparable to the Battleknit of the Lebron 16. The upper is TPU-coated which delivers a lot of support but feels a little rough.
10972,251,32,8.0,2019-09-16,materials,The Flyknit upper material feels a little harder and plasticky than the Battleknit from the Lebron 16.  On-foot the materials are comfortable and supportive.
10973,251,293,8.0,2019-09-04,materials,"I don't like the way the ""bubbly"" Flyknit looks and feels in-hand, but it's soft and conforms nicely to your feet."
10974,251,6,9.0,2019-09-04,support,"The support is just fine: no heel slippage, no side-to-side movements on the footbed, and a ton of torsional rigidity and stability."
10975,251,32,8.0,2019-09-16,support,"Lockdown and support are great, but mobility and stability were not good at all for me. It was just too bulky for me."
10976,251,293,8.0,2019-09-04,support,"Good ankle support and lockdown, but I did feel my foot hitting the outside material on lateral movements."
10977,251,6,8.0,2019-09-04,fit,"The fit is pretty good, but the shoe can be a little tough to get on."
10978,251,293,7.0,2019-09-04,fit,"The fit was pretty roomy in the midfoot and the lacing system didn't allow me to lace it more tightly. Other than that, the fit was good."
10979,251,293,3,2019-09-04,width,Not crazy wide or narrow.
10980,251,293,3,2019-09-04,size,Go true to size.

Amazing traction on clean surfaces. Pretty stable, despite what haters say. These would be nice shoes, but the fit has ruined it all. Blood on my ankles thanks to stiff collar walls and blisters on the Achilles area. Too much pain and life is too short for that.

11033,254,293,5.0,2019-08-15,traction,This rubber slides like crazy! It's not great on clean courts and it gets really bad on dusty courts.
11034,254,45,8.0,2019-10-24,traction,The racetrack-type herringbone traction pattern provides a lot of grip on clean courts but collects a little bit of dust on dirty courts.
11035,254,6,6.0,2019-08-15,traction,"The traction is really inconsistent and even on super clean courts, you don't stop on a dime."
11036,254,365,9.0,2019-08-15,cushion,"Court feel, comfort, and flexibility  - I expected nothing less from Bounce."
11037,254,293,9.0,2019-08-15,cushion,"Court feel is incredible, heel compression is nice, and there is a good bounce throughout the whole outsole."
11038,254,45,9.0,2019-10-24,cushion,"The Bounce cushioning provides court feel, responsiveness, and comfort."
11039,254,6,8.0,2019-08-15,cushion,The Bounce cushioning is a great blend of impact protection and court feel.
11040,254,365,9.0,2019-08-15,materials,The strong textile provides a lot of containment but takes a while to break-in and get comfortable.
11041,254,293,8.0,2019-08-15,materials,Materials feel cheap in-hand but conform nicely to your feet.
11042,254,45,6.0,2019-10-24,materials,"The materials are breathable and flexible. Unfortunately, the materials are way too soft and don't provide enough containment and support for performance basketball shoes."
11043,254,6,7.0,2019-08-15,materials,The materials don't feel premium at all and don't look great either.
11044,254,365,9.0,2019-08-15,support,"Wide base, low profile, and internal heel counter will keep you from sliding off the footbed."
11045,254,293,9.0,2019-08-15,support,"Lateral containment was really good, you feel low-to-the-ground and laterally stable on cuts."
11046,254,45,7.0,2019-10-24,support,The materials are too flexible to feel safe and stable (even though I never experienced issues with the support).
11047,254,6,8.0,2019-08-15,support,I didn't have any heel slippage and no side-to-side movement on the footbed.
11048,254,365,7.0,2019-08-15,fit,I didn't like the massive amount of dead space in the toebox.
11049,254,293,7.0,2019-08-15,fit,Fit wasn't very good for me -  the upper didn't provide a lot of lockdown and there was a lot of dead space in the toe box.
11050,254,45,7.0,2019-10-24,fit,The materials feel nice and snug around the foot.
11051,254,6,7.0,2019-08-15,fit,"A little bit of dead space in the toe box. Overall, the fit isn't terrible."
11052,254,45,100.0,2019-10-24,outdoor,The solid rubber means that you are good to go outdoors.
11053,254,293,2,2019-08-15,width,Pretty snug.
11054,254,45,2,2019-10-24,width,Really snug around the heel and forefoot.
11055,254,6,3,2019-08-15,width,Slightly narrow in the midfoot but a little wide in the forefoot.
11056,254,45,3,2019-10-24,size,True to size.
11057,254,6,4,2019-08-15,size,At least a half size big.
11058,255,365,9.1,2019-10-11,expert_overall,"The Jordan Zoom Zero Gravity is a fast, lightweight, low-top performer at a very affordable price!"
11059,255,6,8.0,2019-08-24,expert_overall,For $100 you get a solid performance hoop shoe. The Zoom Zero Gravity features great traction and solid materials - the only downside is the firm cushioning.

11061,255,365,9.5,2019-10-11,traction,It took a while to ever feel the need to wipe - no matter the surface.
11062,255,6,9.0,2019-08-24,traction,"The traction is really, really nice. Even on dusty courts, I didn't have any issues."
11063,255,365,9.0,2019-10-11,cushion,"The top-loaded Zoom unit in the forefoot and the Phylon midsole provide decent court feel, response, and a bit of impact protection."
11064,255,6,7.0,2019-08-24,cushion,I couldn't feel the Zoom unit in the forefoot very much and the bounce was very minimal. Impact protection comes from the Phylon midsole and it's not great - after playing for hours my feet felt more fatigued than in other shoes.
11065,255,365,9.0,2019-10-11,materials,The basic textiles and synthetics require minimal break-in time and check all the boxes performance-wise but they definitely don't look premium.
11066,255,6,8.0,2019-08-24,materials,The almost full-Mesh upper materials are pretty decent and get the job done. They could feel a little more premium though.
11067,255,365,9.0,2019-10-11,support,The base is rather narrow but I didn't have any issues with lateral stability. The heel counter eliminated any potential heel movement.
11068,255,6,8.0,2019-08-24,support,"The heel counter prevents any heel slippage and the caging in the forefoot kept me from sliding on the footbed. Lateral stability was surprisingly good, considering the rounded outsole that doesn't really have any outriggers."
11069,255,365,9.0,2019-10-11,fit,"I got a snug 1 to 1 fit, perfectly good lockdown, and great Zoom placement underfoot."
11070,255,6,3,2019-08-24,size,Got true to size.
11071,256,32,8.5,2019-07-09,expert_overall,The Zoom Freak 1 is a solid first signature sneaker for Giannis Antetokounmpo. Support and lockdown are great but cushioning and traction feel pretty standard and the quality of the upper materials could be better.
11072,256,293,8.2,2019-07-13,expert_overall,"I enjoyed the Zoom Freak 1, but the cushioning and traction could be better. Unfortunately, this shoe is one tier below the top-performers and, at $120, a little too expensive for what you get."
11073,256,221,8.0,2019-07-02,expert_overall,"A solid on-court performer. I' give it a B performance-wise, because there are better shoes out there that give you more bang-for-the-buck."
11074,256,45,8.0,2019-08-18,expert_overall,The Nike Zoom Freak 1 has definitely a place in my sneaker rotation because it is super comfortable to play in.
11075,256,33,7.8,2019-07-10,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom Freak 1 is a good shoe, but not a great one. Court feel and one-to-one fit are great, but impact protection and traction are disappointing."
11076,256,522,7.8,2019-07-18,expert_overall,The Freak 1 does nothing outstandingly well but that’s okay because it does everything well enough.
11077,256,2,7.8,2021-05-07,expert_overall,"The Nike Zoom Freak 1 is a very low-to-the-ground sneaker. It's lightweight and provides a good amount of court feel, but the cushion could have been better in the forefoot area of the shoe."
11078,256,6,7.5,2019-07-26,expert_overall,"If you like Kobe models - you are probably going to enjoy the Zoom Freak 1. But for $120, there are better performers out there."
11079,256,214,8.6,2023-04-02,user_overall,"Depending on what you value in a shoe, you will love these or hate them. The support, lockdown, and court-feel are fanatic. These wrap around and support your feet as well any shoe I have ever played in. You feel secure and connected to the court. The design and materials are well thought out, and every single color-way tells a story. The cushioning and traction are where the shoe divides people. The cushioning in the forefoot provides great court-feel, but very little bounce/impact protection."
11080,256,472,7.0,2024-01-07,user_overall,"The translucent outsole didn't really work out for me; I was slipping on some plays. I definitely would've preferred a rubber outsole. Cushioning was okay; I would've preferred a forefoot zoom unit instead of a heel zoom unit. Materials were average, although they were comfortable. However I do tend to find a lot of moisture from my feet after games after wearing them so breathability is n"
11081,256,258,8.6,2023-09-09,user_overall,Very inconsistent shoe. Starting from traction which was not that great. I don't know if it was the colorway but the uppers ripped after a month. Good looking shoe though.
11082,256,668,9.0,2023-03-27,user_overall,The durability on this shoe was amazing. I hooped every time I hooped in these for almost 2 years and I usually play 5 times a week (min was 3 a week).
11083,256,439,8.0,2023-05-16,user_overall,A very good shoe that kinda reminds me of a pair of kds.It would fit better if you have long narrow feet.There are some nice colorways to
11084,256,32,8.0,2019-07-09,traction,"The traction is not the greatest, but it's not bad either. The outsole attracts a lot of dust. Overall, traction is solid, especially on clean courts."
11085,256,293,7.0,2019-07-13,traction,"Once there is a little dust, you will be wiping very, very often! Also, the dust is really hard to wipe off the translucent rubber part of the outsole."
11086,256,221,8.0,2019-07-02,traction,The traction feels really solid and tacky. The translucent rubber gripped just as well as the solid rubber parts of the outsole.
11087,256,45,7.0,2019-08-18,traction,The translucent rubber parts of the outsole attract a lot of dust. If you don't wipe you're going to slip.
11088,256,33,7.0,2019-07-10,traction,"The traction was very inconsistent, sometimes it was REALLY good, other times I had to wipe my outsoles a lot."
11089,256,522,8.0,2019-07-18,traction,I was pleased that they stuck pretty well after the break-in period.
11090,256,2,8.0,2021-05-07,traction,"On a clean court, the traction grips nicely. It does pick up dust on the transparent part of the traction though."
11091,256,6,7.0,2019-07-26,traction,"The traction wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Worked well on clean courts, but on dusty courts you will not stop on a dime and slide just a little bit before you come to a stop."
11092,256,32,8.0,2019-07-09,cushion,The double-stacked Zoom in the heel is nice and the Phylon midsole is really responsive.
11093,256,293,7.0,2019-07-13,cushion,"You feel very low-to-the-ground, that's about it."
11094,256,221,7.0,2019-07-02,cushion,The double-stacked Zoom in the heel feels plush and comfortable. But why is there no cushioning in the forefoot? The Phylon in the forefoot is okay but just can't compare to the heel.
11095,256,45,7.0,2019-08-18,cushion,"The double-stacked Zoom unit surrounded by a very soft Phylon carrier in the heel does its job, but we would have preferred it to be in the forefoot."
11096,256,33,7.0,2019-07-10,cushion,No cushioning in the forefoot and double-stacked Zoom Air in the heel. Great court feel but not a well-balanced cushioning setup.
11097,256,522,7.0,2019-07-18,cushion,Cushioning is not ultra bouncy or exciting to play in.
11098,256,2,7.0,2021-05-07,cushion,The double-stacked Zoom in the heel makes impact protection solid. The Phylon in the forefoot is soft but could have been better. I wish they added an additional cushion to the forefoot.
11099,256,6,8.0,2019-07-26,cushion,"The cushioning feels very familiar from the Kobe signature line. The Phylon in the forefoot is not super hard and provides a little bit of comfort and impact protection, the Zoom unit in the heel feels nice."
11100,256,32,7.0,2019-07-09,materials,The quality of the materials feels a little below average. Feels pretty standard for a first signature shoe and gets the job done.
11101,256,293,8.0,2019-07-13,materials,"Materials are not super high-quality, but they look great and feel very comfortable."
11102,256,45,9.0,2019-08-18,materials,"Breathable, lightweight and really flexible. There is almost zero break-in time and the materials are very durable."
11103,256,33,7.0,2019-07-10,materials,"The materials are not premium, but require no break-in time and are very durable."
11104,256,522,7.0,2019-07-18,materials,"If you are looking fir premium-feeling or looking materials, this is not your shoe."
11105,256,2,8.0,2021-05-07,materials,A honeycomb-style mesh primarily makes up the upper. It's easily broken in.
11106,256,6,7.0,2019-07-26,materials,"The Mesh upper feels really rough and hard but breaks-in after a while. Overall, I think Giannis deserves better materials."
11107,256,32,9.0,2019-07-09,support,Lockdown works extremely well - my feet were not moving at all!
11108,256,293,10.0,2019-07-13,support,Support and lockdown are amazing.
11109,256,45,8.0,2019-08-18,support,Feels like a Kobe with more support - perfect for an explosive player like Giannis.
11110,256,33,9.0,2019-07-10,support,The midsole sculpt keeps your foot on the footbed and the flat base and small outrigger provide lateral stability.
11111,256,522,8.0,2019-07-18,support,The heel counter and fit are so good that they feel supportive - but the omission of a midfoot shank could be a no-no for some.
11112,256,2,8.0,2021-05-07,support,The shoe offers solid lateral containment due to the wing material found on the side of the shoe. The heel support and ankle lockdown are well cushioned and supportive.
11113,256,6,8.0,2019-07-26,support,"No side-to-side movement, no heel slippage, and a wide and stable base."
11114,256,32,8.0,2019-07-09,fit,"Once you tighten up the shoe, you're good to go. Not super comfortable, but not painful either."
11115,256,293,9.0,2019-07-13,fit,Fits like a glove!
11116,256,221,9.0,2019-07-02,fit,The soft upper and padding feel super comfortable.
11117,256,45,9.0,2019-08-18,fit,The Nike Zoom Freak 1 feels really nice on-foot.
11118,256,33,9.0,2019-07-10,fit,"The Zoom Freak 1 started off really tight, but after breaking them in they fit like a glove."
11119,256,522,9.0,2019-07-18,fit,"Overall I had the right amount of toe space, zero side to side movement and an awesome heel fit."
11120,256,293,50.0,2019-07-13,outdoor,"Thick and deep grooves, should work decently well outdoors."
11121,256,2,0.0,2021-05-07,outdoor,I wouldn't recommend these for outdoor use.
11122,256,293,2,2019-07-13,width,The fit is snug.
11123,256,522,3,2019-07-18,width,The shoe isn’t ultra-narrow.
11124,256,6,2,2019-07-26,width,A little bit narrow in the forefoot.
11125,256,293,3,2019-07-13,size,I went true to size and it fits like a glove.
11126,256,45,3,2019-08-18,size,Go true to size.
11127,256,522,3,2019-07-18,size,True to size.
11128,256,2,3,2021-05-07,size,I would go true to your size unless you've played in Kobes. Use your Kobe size.
11129,256,6,3,2019-07-26,size,Runs true to size.
11130,257,32,9.0,2019-07-20,expert_overall,"I am pretty satisfied with the performance of the DON issue #1. My favorite aspects are the traction, the super-responsive cushioning and the awesome price point of $100."
11131,257,33,8.7,2019-07-21,expert_overall,I actually loved the D.O.N. Issue 1 with the exception of the traction.
11132,257,221,8.5,2019-09-09,expert_overall,"At $99, this shoe provides a ton of performance! I'd say this is the best under $100 sneaker currently on the market. The DON issue 1 is a very versatile shoe and should work for all players!"
11133,257,293,8.2,2019-07-09,expert_overall,I didn't like the DON Issue 1 too much. It's heavy and chunky and the traction is too inconsistent.
11134,257,2,8.2,2021-05-07,expert_overall,"The Adidas DON Issue #1 is a great shoe for anyone who is looking for a quick, responsive and supportive performer. It has plenty of court feel and the traction was consistent. My only gripe is that they could've made the cushion a bit bouncier."
11135,257,6,8.0,2019-07-23,expert_overall,"I will keep this shoe because of the good-looking Spiderman collaboration but I think there are better performers, even at $100."
11136,257,45,8.0,2019-08-15,expert_overall,The DON Issue 1 is a very comfortable and supportive shoe that works perfectly for explosive basketball players.

11138,257,294,7.5,2023-10-13,user_overall,"The first pair of Adidas that I had, I can't say much about it since I wore it two sizes larger than I used to because it was my first pair of Adidas, the cushioning and traction didn't give me problems but due to the poor fit that I did sprain my ankle once or twice, the durability for outdoors is good although the upper materials were damaged in several areas. Despite the low shaft, I recommend it for any position and type of court, at the time you could get it for 37 euros, which was crazy co"
11139,257,317,9.2,2021-12-24,user_overall,"My experience with this shoe has been amazing. It is durable, the traction is still there after years of usage on outdoors and indoors courts. The cushion isn't otherworldly but they get the job done really well, they provide great court feel and some impact protection. The fit is really great. I also really like the way it looks and this colorway glows in the dark, so pretty dope."
11140,257,480,7.8,2021-11-23,user_overall,"I wouldn't recommend this shoe, mainly because the traction was really bad, even on clean courts. Everything else about this shoe is alright."
11141,257,670,7.4,2022-01-18,user_overall,"Traction is overall the only issue, but even after two years and lots of use, the traction does not seem improved."
11142,257,32,9.0,2019-07-20,traction,"The traction is superb and grips the floor really, really well. It's also really squeaky!"
11143,257,33,7.0,2019-07-21,traction,"Even though everybody else seems to love the traction, I just had too much slipping."
11144,257,221,7.0,2019-09-09,traction,"The web-herringbone pattern and the soft rubber should provide great traction, but the traction pattern is rather shallow and dense which led to some slipping and sliding on dustier courts. If you play on dusty courts, you will have to wipe a lot."
11145,257,293,7.0,2019-07-09,traction,The traction is fine but a little inconsistent - even on clean courts.
11146,257,2,8.0,2021-05-07,traction,"Traction gripped well in moist and dusty conditions. The grip is there, but isn't too drastic."
11147,257,6,7.0,2019-07-23,traction,"The traction of the DON Issue #1 was really inconsistent. Often times, I was sliding a little when trying to stop -  herringbone shouldn't do that!"
11148,257,45,7.0,2019-08-15,traction,"The traction did its thing, but the herringbone pattern will require some wiping on dustier courts."
11149,257,32,9.0,2019-07-20,cushion,"Super bouncy, responsive and you still get court feel."
11150,257,33,9.0,2019-07-21,cushion,I found the D.O.N. Issue 1 to be one of the most comfortable iterations of Bounce I’ve experienced.
11151,257,221,10.0,2019-09-09,cushion,"The full-length Bounce insole is hands-down my favorite feature of this sneaker. In my opinion, this is the most versatile cushioning on the market: it's responsive, comfortable and provides court feel and impact protection."
11152,257,293,8.0,2019-07-09,cushion,"Court feel is great, impact protection is good, but you don't get a lot of bounce."
11153,257,2,8.0,2021-05-07,cushion,"Court feel and responsiveness are awesome with the full-length Bounce cushion. It had decent impact protection, but could've felt bouncier."
11154,257,6,8.0,2019-07-23,cushion,A lot of court feel and responsiveness but only decent impact protection. Works best for guards looking for a responsive shoe.
11155,257,45,8.0,2019-08-15,cushion,"The thick cushioning is really plush and bouncy, but also a little bulky."
11156,257,32,8.0,2019-07-20,materials,"The materials aren't bad, but the breathability is problematic."
11157,257,33,9.0,2019-07-21,materials,I found the textile and mesh build to be perfectly fine.
11158,257,221,8.0,2019-09-09,materials,The materials are fine but not spectacular.
11159,257,293,9.0,2019-07-09,materials,The mesh upper materials feel really premium.
11160,257,2,8.0,2021-05-07,materials,It's made up of a mesh upper that looks and feels durable. I didn't feel a lot of stretching in the upper. Performed nicely.
11161,257,6,9.0,2019-07-23,materials,"Materials feel really good in-hand and on-foot, especially for this price."
11162,257,45,8.0,2019-08-15,materials,"Breathable, flexible and lightweight Mesh."
11163,257,32,8.0,2019-07-20,support,Very wide base provides a lot of stability and the heavily padded Achilles pillows keep your feet locked down.
11164,257,33,9.5,2019-07-21,support,"Support, like in many of Adidas’ current basketball line, is very good."
11165,257,221,9.0,2019-09-09,support,The base is absolutely massive and provides a lot of stability. The thick padding on the inner lining really locks your feet into place and prevents heel slippage and lateral sliding.
11166,257,293,8.0,2019-07-09,support,Lateral containment is great but the heel slippage is pretty bad in the beginning.
11167,257,2,9.0,2021-05-07,support,The ample pillows around the heel area coupled with a solid lacing setup provide excellent support around the back of your foot. There is also a wide base and decent outrigger that provides solid stability.
11168,257,6,8.0,2019-07-23,support,"The support was perfectly fine. No side-to-side movement, forefoot containment was good, but I had a little bit of heel slippage during the break-in period."
11169,257,45,9.0,2019-08-15,support,"The insane double outrigger, internal TPU heel counter, the lacing system, and ankle padding deliver a lot of support and stability."

11174,257,6,8.0,2019-07-23,fit,The materials hugged my feet nicely.
11175,257,45,8.0,2019-08-15,fit,The padding around the ankle is very comfortable and helps with support & lockdown.
11176,257,293,2,2019-07-09,width,Really snug in the toe area.
11177,257,2,4,2021-05-07,width,"It is fairly wide shoe, so you may be able to go true to size if your feet are wide. I would still suggest trying them on first."
11178,257,6,2,2019-07-23,width,A little bit narrow in the forefoot.

11181,257,2,3,2021-05-07,size,I would suggest going down half a size if you have a regular shaped foot.
11182,257,6,4,2019-07-23,size,I would recommend going down half a size.
11183,257,45,3,2019-08-15,size,True to size.
11184,258,6,9.0,2019-07-31,expert_overall,"For only $90, this is an amazing performer! A minimal shoe for players who like court feel over impact protection."
11185,258,293,8.8,2019-07-13,expert_overall,"Great performer! I would not change anything about this shoe, besides the traction."
11186,258,671,9.0,2021-11-24,user_overall,"A great choice for players who want great traction, but don't care too much about impact protection. The cushion isn't the worst, it's just pretty hard and responsive. The materials are pretty high quality, but not super breathable. The rubber is really hard which makes it good for outdoor use, but the lack of cushioning might be a problem for some players. This shoe is probably the best for guards, and shifty players in general. Overall, it's a solid performer at a good price."
11187,258,455,9.2,2022-02-09,user_overall,"Possibly my favourite shoe of all time. I am relatively small, standing at 5’8 and 69KG, and these worked like a charm. Incredible traction on any surface, superb support and immaculate comfort. At the beginning they sucked, but over 2-4 hours, the materials broke in and moulded to my feet incredibly well. The Micro G softened up over a 3 hour session, and wow were they incredible. For any guard, 10/10 would recommend."
11188,258,483,8.6,2021-11-08,user_overall,"Very nice shoe, wouldn’t change anything, except the cushioning. Traction has a good bite, and would definitely use for outdoor use."

11190,258,673,9.2,2022-04-18,user_overall,"Brilliant shoe, however lack of impact protection so will take some getting use to."
11191,258,6,10.0,2019-07-31,traction,The combination of rubber compound and herringbone pattern provides amazing traction - I really couldn't believe it!
11192,258,293,9.0,2019-07-13,traction,Really good bite on clean courts and dust is not an issue - I don't think I wiped once!
11193,258,6,8.0,2019-07-31,cushion,"This is the firmest Micro-G cushioning I have ever experienced. Pure responsiveness, but very minimal bounciness or impact protection."
11194,258,293,7.0,2019-07-13,cushion,Court feel is very good. But the cushioning is super firm which means no bounce and very little impact protection.
11195,258,6,9.0,2019-07-31,materials,"The synthetic leather upper feels soft, breaks in very nicely and provides a great 1:1 fit."
11196,258,293,9.0,2019-07-13,materials,"The synthetic leather is super soft and breaks-in nicely. The upper is very thin, supportive, and feels great on foot."
11197,258,6,9.0,2019-07-31,support,"No heel slippage whatsoever, no side-to-side movement in the forefoot, and the lateral outrigger provides stability."
11198,258,293,9.0,2019-07-13,support,"Lateral containment is great, you're low to the ground, and the outrigger will provide additional stability on cuts."
11199,258,6,9.0,2019-07-31,fit,"A really good 1:1 fit, no dead space and great lockdown."

11203,259,33,9.0,2019-08-08,expert_overall,The Under Armour HOVR Havoc 2 is another solid basketball shoe with traction that's built Ford tough and cushioning that's a little firm but kept me stable and made me feel faster than I really am.
11204,259,293,8.6,2019-07-13,expert_overall,The HOVR Havoc 2 is a good performer but a step down from top-tier performers. I liked almost everything about this shoe but the traction was a little too inconsistent for me.
11205,259,6,8.6,2019-07-31,expert_overall,"Except for the occasional slip out, the HOVR Havoc 2 is a very good performer. But I think that you can find better-performing sneakers at $120."
11206,259,169,9.8,2023-11-06,user_overall,Keep these indoors amazing cushion traction solid amazing curved shape easy to shoot easy to run plus felt so comfortable while playing. I regret taking these outside :(

11208,259,33,9.0,2019-08-08,traction,Once the outsole broke-in the grip was great.
11209,259,293,8.0,2019-07-13,traction,"Traction is solid, especially on clean courts. But on dusty courts, I sometimes slipped out on step backs and crossovers."
11210,259,6,7.0,2019-07-31,traction,"Regardless of which court I played on, I experienced occasional slips on hard cuts."
11211,259,33,9.0,2019-08-08,cushion,I found the HOVR to be on the firmer side. The setup provides a lot of stability and court feel but there is not a lot of impact protection.
11212,259,293,8.0,2019-07-13,cushion,Court feel is nice and impact protection is solid - nothing spectacular here.
11213,259,6,9.0,2019-07-31,cushion,Really good impact protection without sacrificing too much court feel or responsiveness. I can play hours in these shoes and my legs never feel dead.
11214,259,33,9.0,2019-08-08,materials,The micro-molded mesh molds around your feet for a perfect 1:1 fit.

11217,259,33,9.0,2019-08-08,support,Support is solid.
11218,259,293,9.0,2019-07-13,support,"Lateral support is very good thanks to the caging of the outsole, ankle support is solid, and I felt stable overall thanks to the low and wide base."
11219,259,6,9.0,2019-07-31,support,"I didn't have any heel slippage, no side-to-side movements on the footbed, and the HOVR cushioning forms an outrigger that provided lateral stability."
11220,259,33,9.0,2019-08-08,fit,The build. last and lacing system do a great job.
11221,259,293,9.0,2019-07-13,fit,Fits really well like every Under Armour for me.
11222,259,6,9.0,2019-07-31,fit,No dead space and great 1:1 fit for my feet.
11223,259,293,100.0,2019-07-13,outdoor,"Strong, strong rubber with very deep grooves which will work very well outdoors."
11224,259,293,2,2019-07-13,width,Nice and snug fit.
11225,259,6,2,2019-07-31,width,"For a slightly wide-footer like me, this shoe felt pretty tight in the forefoot."

11227,259,6,3,2019-07-31,size,Going true to size works perfectly well.
11228,260,33,9.1,2019-08-03,expert_overall,The Lebron Soldier 13 performs well in every category - on hardwood and blacktop!
11229,260,6,9.0,2019-07-18,expert_overall,"For a pretty solid price of $140, you get awesome cushioning, great traction, great fit, and great materials. The straps also work really well on this version of the Lebron Solider and don't come undone like on previous models."
11230,260,45,8.8,2019-09-12,expert_overall,This is one of the best-reviewed shoes in the history of our Youtube channel!
11231,260,2,8.8,2021-05-07,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron Soldier 13 features one of the best traction setups to go with the plush cushioning. The materials get the job done. Support and lockdown perform well, with the only complaint being that the lateral containment could be a tad bit better."
11232,260,293,8.3,2019-07-21,expert_overall,I enjoyed playing in the Lebron Soldier 13 - it's a good performer. But cushioning could have been better and the $140 price tag is pretty expensive.
11233,260,576,9.6,2022-02-07,user_overall,"Better than soldier 14, have more protection for ankle.. suitable for bigman, slightly heavy but very safety shoes…"

11240,260,45,9.0,2019-09-12,traction,"The traction pattern held up extremely well, even on very dusty courts."
11241,260,2,10.0,2021-05-07,traction,There is full-length herringbone that grips hard. It's one of the best tractions on a shoe this year.
11242,260,293,9.0,2019-07-21,traction,After breaking the rubber in the traction is really nice and works well even on dusty courts.
11243,260,33,9.0,2019-08-03,cushion,"The cushion is raised off the floor quite a bit and the bottom-loaded Zoom units provide a lot of impact protection but I missed the ""springy"" feeling you often get from Zoom."
11244,260,6,8.0,2019-07-18,cushion,The Phylon midsole with Zoom units in the heel and forefoot provides a lot of impact protection and a light bounce.
11245,260,45,9.0,2019-09-12,cushion,The forefoot and heel Zoom units provide a great mix of impact protection and court feel. The heel to toe transition is also really good.
11246,260,2,9.0,2021-05-07,cushion,The injected Phylon in the Soldier 13 is plush. The softness allows you to get the most out of the Zoom units in the shoe.
11247,260,293,7.0,2019-07-21,cushion,"For a Lebron Soldier the court feel is actually pretty good, but overall the cushioning feels lacklustre. Impact protection isn't great and you don't get a lot of bounce either."
11248,260,33,9.0,2019-08-03,materials,"Nothing really special, or premium, but it works."
11249,260,6,9.0,2019-07-18,materials,"The materials are very durable, supportive, and comfortable. Unfortunately, ventilation is lacking."
11250,260,45,8.0,2019-09-12,materials,The supportive materials feel fantastic on-foot but they are not breathable at all. The break-in period is short.
11251,260,2,8.0,2021-05-07,materials,The upper is primarily made up of ripstop material. It is lightweight and performs on foot.
11252,260,293,9.0,2019-07-21,materials,"The upper materials is super durable, looks good and feels comfortable on-foot and in-hand."
11253,260,33,9.0,2019-08-03,support,"The support relies on the great fit, but a beefier outrigger would have been welcome."
11254,260,6,9.0,2019-07-18,support,No side-to-side movement on the footbed and no instabilities on lateral movements.
11255,260,45,10.0,2019-09-12,support,The straps are super supportive and hold down your feet on all movements.
11256,260,2,9.0,2021-05-07,support,The strap system locks your foot into the footbed. Your ankle is also secure in this system.
11257,260,293,8.0,2019-07-21,support,Support and lockdown are great but the outrigger could have been bigger.
11258,260,33,9.0,2019-08-03,fit,Lockdown was good it despite being a laceless shoe.
11259,260,6,9.0,2019-07-18,fit,The straps do a great job of locking you in and I got a great 1:1 fit.
11260,260,45,8.0,2019-09-12,fit,"The straps were pinching my feet a little bit and there was a little bit of heel slippage in the beginning. After the breakin period, the fit was fine."
11261,260,2,8.0,2021-05-07,fit,The fit is more customizable than I thought it would be. The strap system allows you to adjust the fit based on your needs.
11262,260,45,100.0,2019-09-12,outdoor,The hard rubber and deep grooves held up really well outdoors.
11263,260,2,100.0,2021-05-07,outdoor,The rubber compound is thick and durable.
11264,260,293,50.0,2019-07-21,outdoor,Outdoor use should be okay because the rubber is really deep.
11265,260,6,1,2019-07-18,width,"Really snug, especially in the forefoot."
11266,260,293,2,2019-07-21,width,Fits real snug.
11267,260,6,3,2019-07-18,size,"Lengthwise, it's perfectly fine going true to size."
11268,260,45,2,2019-09-12,size,Go half a size up.
11269,260,2,3,2021-05-07,size,Go true to your regular size unless you have a wide foot. Then you might want to consider going half a size up.
11270,260,293,3,2019-07-21,size,Go true to size.
11271,261,293,8.8,2019-06-11,expert_overall,Get them! The Converse All Star Pro BB is freaking awesome.
11272,261,33,8.3,2019-06-11,expert_overall,The Converse All Star Pro BB is a really good basketball shoe. I especially liked the one-to-one fit and the lightweight feel but the traction and the insole lining could be improved.
11273,261,6,8.0,2019-08-22,expert_overall,"For $140, I would not recommend the Converse Pro BB just because of the inconsistent traction."
11274,261,45,7.6,2020-04-01,expert_overall,"The traction and cushioning are A1, but the fit and support are a real lockdown. Wear double socks and an ankle brace and you will have a lot of fun."
11275,261,617,8.3,2022-02-12,user_overall,I love the show for support and traction but I can’t wear it for very long at a time. The top of insole kind of rubs off if you play in these a lot but once it’s all off the shoe works great.
11276,261,635,6.2,2022-10-19,user_overall,"Very tight, blisters every time i wear them for long periods of time. Cushion is incredibly stiff. Materials feel cheap and there seems to be optimal support. Traction is very good."

11278,261,293,9.0,2019-06-11,traction,"Traction is insanely nice and has a really good bite on a clean court. On dusty courts, it picks up a lot of dust but requires only a light wipe to be good again."
11279,261,33,7.0,2019-06-11,traction,The traction is awesome at times but overall rather inconsistent.
11280,261,6,6.0,2019-08-22,traction,The traction of full-translucent rubber is very inconsistent and picks up a lot of dust.
11281,261,45,9.0,2020-04-01,traction,"The semi-translucent outsole was durable, grippy and dust collection was minimal."
11282,261,293,8.0,2019-06-11,cushion,"The React insole is nice and responsive, but I would have like a little more bounce comparable to the Kobe AD NXT 360."
11283,261,33,9.0,2019-06-11,cushion,The full-length React drop-in midsole felt smooth and offered a slight bounce when brand new.
11284,261,6,8.0,2019-08-22,cushion,"The full-length React drop-in insole feels a lot stiffer than I am used to from React cushioning.  You get a slight bounce, some impact protection but a lot of court feel and responsiveness."
11285,261,45,10.0,2020-04-01,cushion,"The full-length drop-in React insole is great. 10/10 court feel, 10/10 responsiveness, 10/10 comfort!"
11286,261,293,9.0,2019-06-11,materials,"The materials are really thin, minimal and really comfortable."
11287,261,33,7.0,2019-06-11,materials,The mix of mesh and canvas make for a very minimal basketball shoe with barely enough support for gameplay.
11288,261,6,9.0,2019-08-22,materials,"The full-Mesh upper feels similar to the Kobe AD NXT 360 and is very thin, light, and breathable."
11289,261,45,7.0,2020-04-01,materials,The Nike quad-fit materials are nothing spectacular. Very lightweight and breathable but just not very supportive.
11290,261,293,9.0,2019-06-11,support,Support and lockdown are great.
11291,261,33,9.0,2019-06-11,support,"Support feels very minimal, similar to the Kobe AD NXT 360"
11292,261,6,8.0,2019-08-22,support,"The base is decently wide, and even without an outrigger, I had no problems with lateral stability. The heel counter prevented any heel slippage and the containment as very good thanks to the great fit."
11293,261,45,6.0,2020-04-01,support,The minimalistic shoe just doesn't offer enough support for basketball gameplay.
11294,261,33,9.5,2019-06-11,fit,"The textiles, canvas and super thin TPU overlays move really nicely with your feet."
11295,261,6,9.0,2019-08-22,fit,"The fit is really, really good."
11296,261,45,6.0,2020-04-01,fit,We experienced a lot of heel slippage and a lot of rubbing in the toe box. The tongue also kept moving to the side and you had to readjust all the time.
11297,261,293,50.0,2019-06-11,outdoor,The traction is durable enough for occasional outdoor use.
11298,261,6,2,2019-08-22,width,The fit is rather snug.
11299,261,6,3,2019-08-22,size,Runs true to size.
11300,262,33,9.1,2019-06-20,expert_overall,The CP3 12 is a no-nonsense type of shoe that offers a lot of performance for it’s $100 price point. I'm pleasantly surprised!
11301,262,293,8.6,2019-06-12,expert_overall,This is a top-tier performer with premium materials at a great retail price of only $100!

11307,262,33,9.0,2019-06-20,cushion,The forefoot Zoom Air and lightweight Phylon midsole felt just right.
11308,262,293,9.0,2019-06-12,cushion,The Phylon midsole feels super comfortable but the forefoot Zoom isn't as bouncy as I would have hoped.
11309,262,6,8.0,2019-07-18,cushion,"The Zoom unit in the forefoot is bouncy and responsive, the Phylon midsole is rather firm overall."
11310,262,33,9.0,2019-06-20,materials,Flyknit is usually reserved for much more expensive shoes!
11311,262,293,9.0,2019-06-12,materials,One of the nicest Flyknit materials I have felt in a long time. The synthetic suede on the medial side and in the heel isn't great though.
11312,262,6,9.0,2019-07-18,materials,The Flyknit is super-nice!
11313,262,33,9.0,2019-06-20,support,The support gets the job done.

11315,262,6,8.0,2019-07-18,support,"No heel slippage, my ankles felt secure and the wide base provides stability on lateral cuts."
11316,262,33,9.0,2019-06-20,fit,Once I was laced up I just had fun and played.
11317,262,293,8.0,2019-06-12,fit,The fit of the flexible Flyknit upper feels great but the customizable lacing system feels a bit gimmicky.

11319,262,293,100.0,2019-06-12,outdoor,This looks like a great outdoor traction pattern.
11320,262,293,2,2019-06-12,width,The width is slightly narrow.

11324,263,33,9.0,2019-06-20,expert_overall,"If you want a fairly light, low and fast shoe without any weaknesses then the Kyrie Low 2 is a great choice!"
11325,263,365,8.6,2019-07-11,expert_overall,The Kyrie Low 2 ticks all the boxes for me. My favorite Kyrie I have played in so far!
11326,263,45,8.6,2019-07-26,expert_overall,"A supportive low-top, with great traction and good cushioning - it's all I ever wanted!"
11327,263,293,8.4,2019-06-20,expert_overall,"For only $110, get them! This is probably the best Kyrie model out there right now. The only thing that should have been better, is the stiff and uncomfortable cushioning."
11328,263,6,8.4,2019-07-26,expert_overall,"For $110, this is an absolute steal. Traction is the most important thing in a basketball shoe for me, and the traction of the Kyrie Low 2 is absolutely money!"
11329,263,678,9.2,2022-10-09,user_overall,"Amazing shoe for any guard/forward with any play style and had for many years still been one of my favourites. If the cushioning was improved it'll be one of the best hoop shoes ever, trying to put a drop-in midsole in these bad boys asap."
11330,263,361,8.4,2022-01-23,user_overall,"The Kyrie low 2 is a perfect shoe for the small and quick players. If you need top-notch traction and good support with a low to the ground cushion, this is a perfect shoe for you!"
11331,263,567,9.2,2022-03-15,user_overall,These shoes have been amazing to play in! The traction was great on dust courts and the materials kept up great after 1 year of wear! Definitely recommend for guards!

11334,263,33,9.0,2019-06-20,traction,You will love how they grip the floor!
11335,263,365,9.0,2019-07-11,traction,"Performance is silent, but solid. No bark, but real bite."
11336,263,45,10.0,2019-07-26,traction,The traction is literally perfect!
11337,263,293,9.0,2019-06-20,traction,"Very, very good bite! You will stop on a dime on clean courts. On dusty courts, you will need to wipe frequently"
11338,263,6,9.0,2019-07-26,traction,The traction is awesome!
11339,263,33,9.0,2019-06-20,cushion,The heel and forefoot rectangular Zoom Air units feel a little bouncier and softer than the Kyrie Low 1 which is a good thing!
11340,263,365,7.0,2019-07-11,cushion,The cushioning was probably the least favorite part of the Kyrie Low 2.
11341,263,45,8.0,2019-07-26,cushion,Probably the best-cushioned Kyrie shoe. The forefoot and heel Zoom units are low-to-the-ground and very responsive but don't provide a huge amount of impact protection.
11342,263,293,6.0,2019-06-20,cushion,"I really tried to break them in, but I couldn't feel the Zoom units in the heel and forefoot and the Phylon is super stiff."
11343,263,6,8.0,2019-07-26,cushion,"I'm a little disappointed because I couldn't feel the Zoom unit in the heel. Overall, the cushioning provides great court feel and a slight bounce, but impact protection isn't great."
11344,263,33,9.0,2019-06-20,materials,"The textiles are soft, flexible, and sturdy enough to provide good support."
11345,263,365,9.0,2019-07-11,materials,"No break-in time required, supportive, flexible, and durable."
11346,263,45,8.0,2019-07-26,materials,"The materials are flexible but supportive, and durable enough for outdoor use. Ventilation is a problem though."
11347,263,293,9.0,2019-06-20,materials,"For $110, the materials feel really premium and comfortable."
11348,263,6,9.0,2019-07-26,materials,"The textile upper material is surprisingly premium, conforms nicely to your feet and provides good lockdown."
11349,263,33,9.0,2019-06-20,support,"The platform is less-rounded than other Kyries and therefore more stable. The heel counter could be a little stronger, but the good fit and the rubber wrap on the lateral side do a good job to lock you onto the footbed."
11350,263,365,9.0,2019-07-11,support,This is a darn stable low top!
11351,263,45,9.0,2019-07-26,support,"Exaggerated lateral outrigger, huge heel counter and great lacing system."
11352,263,293,9.0,2019-06-20,support,Support and lateral containment are awesome.
11353,263,6,8.0,2019-07-26,support,"Heel counter, mid-foot plate, and a pretty wide base -  no support problems at all!"
11354,263,33,9.0,2019-06-20,fit,Great lockdown in the forefoot but I had to adjust a little bit to get the rear section the way I want.
11355,263,365,9.0,2019-07-11,fit,The Kyrie Low 2 is near perfect for my feet.
11356,263,45,8.0,2019-07-26,fit,The Kyrie Low 2 is a great-fitting shoe thanks to the adaptive lacing system.
11357,263,293,9.0,2019-06-20,fit,The fit is super snug which I really like.  The lacing system works well and the Kyrie 2 Low is super easy to get on.
11358,263,6,8.0,2019-07-26,fit,I felt perfectly comfortable after a short break-in.
11359,263,45,100.0,2019-07-26,outdoor,Durable enough to play outdoors.
11360,263,293,0.0,2019-06-20,outdoor,The soft and pliable rubber will not last very long outdoors.
11361,263,6,0.0,2019-07-26,outdoor,Definitely don't take these outdoors because the nubs will probably not last very long.
11362,263,45,2,2019-07-26,width,The fit is a little narrow so if you have wide feet go up half a size.
11363,263,293,1,2019-06-20,width,It's a very tight fit!
11364,263,6,2,2019-07-26,width,"A little bit narrow in the forefoot, but even as a slightly wide-footer I had no problem going true to size."
11365,263,293,3,2019-06-20,size,Lengthwise was good for me.
11366,263,6,3,2019-07-26,size,Runs true to size.
11367,264,293,7.6,2019-04-12,expert_overall,"The Mamba Focus is really cheap and the performance is okay, but there are much better shoes even at similarly low prices (Nike PG3, Kyrie Flytrap 2)."
11368,264,6,7.3,2019-04-12,expert_overall,"I wouldn't recommend the Kobe Mamba Focus. The traction isn't good, impact protection is very minimal, and the fit was really uncomfortable for my wide feet."
11369,264,214,7.4,2023-04-02,user_overall,"This is a budget model for a reason, but is by no means a bad shoe. While the cushioning does little to keep your feet fresh, the court-feel is good. The outsole is very stiff out of the box, and collects dust easily. Support in these shoes is good. I felt locked down, and there is a nice outrigger at the forefoot. While this shoe is only equipped with the “gum stick” forefoot zoom air unit, I found it surprisingly easy to get vertical in these shoes. Replacing the stock insole helps a lot."
11370,264,361,7.6,2022-01-23,user_overall,Overall the Mamba Focus is a decent performer. The traction gets the job done but it was a little inconsistent for me on dust. The cushion is a responsive set up with a low profile feel to it which is good for players who don’t need very much impact protection. But if anything else you can find much better performers at the same price if not even lower.
11371,264,680,8.8,2021-11-21,user_overall,Pretty good shoe. It's a Kobe shoe so it's really good for being shifty on the court. Also has nice spring to it even after use. Overall a comfortable shoe that's excellent for indoor basketball.
11372,264,439,7.4,2023-05-16,user_overall,This shoe is more like a boot than a basketball shoes.There are some cheaper basketball shoes that you can get that are bettrt
11373,264,681,8.4,2021-11-22,user_overall,"Pretty good shoe, good luck finding some for a good price tho."
11374,264,293,7.0,2019-04-12,traction,"Traction did get a little better over time, but overall it was a little disappointing. Doesn't pick up a lot of dust."
11375,264,6,7.0,2019-04-12,traction,"The traction was really, really bad at first, and even after breaking in it never got really good."
11376,264,293,7.0,2019-04-12,cushion,The heel is made of super-hard Phylon which provides good court feel but impact protection is not good. The Zoom bag in the forefoot gives you a little bit of bounce.
11377,264,6,7.0,2019-04-12,cushion,"The cushioning is very minimal which makes you feel very quick, but I just need more impact protection in a basketball shoe."
11378,264,293,8.0,2019-04-12,materials,"Materials are very lightweight, feel cheap and flimsy in-hand, but are really comfortable on-foot."
11379,264,6,8.0,2019-04-12,materials,"Considering the price, I really like the aesthetics and performance of the materials."
11380,264,293,8.0,2019-04-12,support,"Heel counter, big outrigger, and lateral support from the Nike swoosh."
11381,264,293,8.0,2019-04-12,fit,It's not the most comfortable shoe but overall the fit is okay.
11382,264,6,7.0,2019-04-12,fit,"Very uncomfortable as a wide-footer. Other than that, the materials are pretty comfortable."
11383,264,6,100.0,2019-04-12,outdoor,Outdoors should be pretty good because of the hard rubber.
11384,264,6,1,2019-04-12,width,"Runs really narrow, if you are a wide-footer stay away from this shoe."
11385,264,6,4,2019-04-12,size,Runs a little long.
11386,265,33,9.2,2019-05-08,expert_overall,The Nike KD 12 is just an all-around good shoe that should cater to most players needs.
11387,265,615,9.2,2019-05-08,expert_overall,"When they’re this nice, you might want to buy ’em twice. I can't stop playing in my KD 12's!"
11388,265,6,9.0,2019-04-18,expert_overall,This is the best performer of this year so far! A huge step up from the disappointing previous KD models.
11389,265,32,9.0,2019-05-08,expert_overall,The cushioning alone is worth the $150! But I would have preferred a little more premium materials.
11390,265,522,8.6,2019-04-18,expert_overall,"The directly-underfoot Zoom set up makes the KD 12 feel fun and exciting. Other than that, this shoe does everything well from A-Z."
11391,265,293,8.4,2019-04-18,expert_overall,"They fixed a lot of things that I didn't like in the predecessor KD11. The cushioning is amazing, materials are solid, fit and support are great! The only downside is the inconsistent traction of the translucent rubber on dusty courts."
11392,265,45,8.4,2019-06-11,expert_overall,This shoe is not a joke! You never felt anything like this full-length Zoom cushioning system and there is finally solid support in a KD shoe.
11393,265,361,9.0,2022-01-23,user_overall,"The KD 12 is a very good all around performer! The traction picked up dust pretty fast, but if anything it got the job done well. The cushion with the Full Length Zoom Stroble is absolutely amazing! It provides both a plush and responsive feel which is perfect for all players. I definitely recommend this shoe to all players!"
11394,265,682,9.0,2022-10-25,user_overall,"I just upgraded from these to the KD15s, I have played in the 15s for months and the 12 is a better shoe in my opinion. They feel much more bouncier and the cushion seems more present during wears. Your feet feel locked down much more than in the 15s. The more I wore this shoe the better it got."
11395,265,683,9.8,2022-12-14,user_overall,"KD 12 is one of the best KDs ever made, the traction is great, especially the cushion and support, these two will add more points to this KD. So I think its fair to give it a 9.8, lost 0.2 on durability."
11396,265,638,8.5,2022-09-02,user_overall,"More of a narrow shoe, go up half a size if you have a wider foot. Traction is there, but is susceptible to dust. Cushion is great, can't ask for a better setup."
11397,265,684,9.4,2022-11-26,user_overall,"Other than the fact that it does pick up some dust, it’s a very overall shoe with no significant weaknesses other than maybe the durability"
11398,265,33,9.0,2019-05-08,traction,The rubber compound used has been nothing short of consistent!
11399,265,615,9.0,2019-05-08,traction,The traction on the KD 12 was super solid. I did have to wipe a bit when dust was present.
11400,265,6,10.0,2019-04-18,traction,The multidirectional lines remind me of fingerprints. This is probably the best performing traction so far this year for me!
11401,265,32,9.0,2019-05-08,traction,I'm a big fan of the traction pattern and the soft rubber.
11402,265,522,9.0,2019-04-18,traction,"The microgrooves do a good job and it's really easy to brush off dirt and dust. Not the best traction, but far better than average."
11403,265,293,8.0,2019-04-18,traction,"On a clean court, the traction is super nice. On a dusty court, I slipped out a few times."
11404,265,45,9.0,2019-06-11,traction,"The ""razorblade"" traction pattern was an absolute joy to play in."
11405,265,33,10.0,2019-05-08,cushion,"This is not only Zoom Air done right, but it’s probably my favorite iteration of the cushion and only solidified my stance on Zoom Air being my favorite cushion of all time."
11406,265,615,10.0,2019-05-08,cushion,The only thing between you and the Air unit is an insole - it's amazing!
11407,265,6,10.0,2019-04-18,cushion,The KD 12 takes full-length Zoom to the next level!
11408,265,32,10.0,2019-05-08,cushion,Your feet have never been so close to Zoom Air! This is one of the best cushioning setups I ever played in. They are super bouncy -  I was able to dunk with a partially torn hamstring in these!
11409,265,522,10.0,2019-04-18,cushion,"The cushioning feels like full-length Zoom should feel. Well, well, well, done Nike!"
11410,265,293,9.0,2019-04-18,cushion,"Your feet sit directly on the segmented Zoom unit which feels great. Court feel is medium, impact protection is great, and you get a lot of bounce."
11411,265,45,10.0,2019-06-11,cushion,This is the best Zoom cushioning I have ever felt under my foot!
11412,265,33,9.0,2019-05-08,materials,"Textiles, screen mesh, and Fuse. Nothing to write home about, but gets the job done!"
11413,265,615,9.0,2019-05-08,materials,The mesh upper with some fuse overlays feels nice and padded.
11414,265,6,8.0,2019-04-18,materials,The materials don't feel the most premium but they get the job done!
11415,265,32,8.0,2019-05-08,materials,"The materials don't look premium, but they do perform well."
11416,265,522,8.0,2019-04-18,materials,The quad-axial Flywire is a nice blend of strength and flexibility. If you want your material to look and feel expensive then you might be a bit disappointed.
11417,265,293,8.0,2019-04-18,materials,The materials are nothing special but get the job done.
11418,265,45,7.0,2019-06-11,materials,I got really used to the Flyknit of previous KD models -  I am a bit disappointed by the textile Mesh used in this version of the KD.
11419,265,33,9.0,2019-05-08,support,"Overall, the support for the KD 12 is very good but I would have preferred a slightly wider base."
11420,265,615,9.0,2019-05-08,support,Support gets an A+ in my book.
11421,265,6,8.0,2019-04-18,support,"No side-to-side movements on the footbed, no heel slippage, and no instabilities."
11422,265,32,8.0,2019-05-08,support,The support features feel pretty standard and do a solid job!
11423,265,522,8.0,2019-04-18,support,No issues at all with support and stability.
11424,265,293,9.0,2019-04-18,support,The foam comes up on the sides to really cage you in and there is no heel slippage thanks to the internal heel counter.
11425,265,45,8.0,2019-06-11,support,The quad-axial Flywire provides a ton of lockdown and support. Much better than previous KD's!
11426,265,33,9.0,2019-05-08,fit,I felt snug and secure when playing in the KD 12 at all times.
11427,265,615,9.0,2019-05-08,fit,"The fit is rather snug, but it won't cut off your circulation."
11428,265,522,8.0,2019-04-18,fit,The simple semi-traditional set up just works.
11429,265,293,8.0,2019-04-18,fit,The fit felt really good.
11430,265,45,8.0,2019-06-11,fit,The Flywire is comfortable and the lacing system works really well.
11431,265,293,50.0,2019-04-18,outdoor,The rubber is pretty hard and the grooves are deep - outdoor use should be okay.
11432,265,45,0.0,2019-06-11,outdoor,The traction pattern is wearing away quickly - don't play them outdoors!
11433,265,6,3,2019-04-18,width,I have a semi-wide foot and I didn't have any problems.
11434,265,522,2,2019-04-18,width,Wide footers will want to go up half a size.
11435,265,293,2,2019-04-18,width,Slightly narrow in the toe area.
11436,265,45,2,2019-06-11,width,Regular to narrow-fitting
11437,265,6,3,2019-04-18,size,The KD 12 runs true to size.
11438,265,522,3,2019-04-18,size,Length is true to size.
11439,265,293,3,2019-04-18,size,"Runs true to size, unlike previous KD models."
11440,265,45,3,2019-06-11,size,Stay true-to-size.
11441,266,45,8.8,2019-06-11,expert_overall,Insane traction and amazing cushioning -  this shoe is an absolute madness!
11442,266,365,8.6,2019-04-06,expert_overall,"No matter what position or style you play, you won't be disappointed with the Adidas Pro Bounce Madness!"
11443,266,293,8.4,2019-04-06,expert_overall,I really like the casual look and the performance on clean courts. Just make sure you don't play on dusty courts with these.
11444,266,6,8.2,2019-04-06,expert_overall,The Pro Bounce is a solid shoe but the traction just didn't do it for me on dusty courts.
11445,266,45,10.0,2019-06-11,traction,The bit of the herringbone traction pattern is amazing and dust collection is minimal.
11446,266,365,9.0,2019-04-06,traction,The traction was reliable on all courts I played on - even some pretty slick ones.
11447,266,293,7.0,2019-04-06,traction,The traction works well on clean courts but it's a bit slippery on dusty courts.
11448,266,6,7.0,2019-04-06,traction,"The traction felt inconsistent. On clean courts, linear movements are good but I did have a few minor slip-ups on lateral cuts. On dirty courts, you will have to wipe constantly."
11449,266,45,9.0,2019-06-11,cushion,"The Bounce cushioning got it all: court feel, response, and impact protection!"
11450,266,365,9.0,2019-04-06,cushion,Full-length Bounce was on point from day one!
11451,266,293,9.0,2019-04-06,cushion,I really like the full-length Bounce cushioning!
11452,266,6,9.0,2019-04-06,cushion,I'm a big fan of the Bounce cushioning as it provides a great mix of impact protection and court feel.
11453,266,45,8.0,2019-06-11,materials,"Breathable, flexible, lightweight, and comfortable. We are just a little disappointed that there is no forged fiber this year."
11454,266,365,7.0,2019-04-06,materials,Nearly 100 percent mesh with minimal fuse and synthetic suede overlays. Doesn't feel or look premium but I like it.
11455,266,293,8.0,2019-04-06,materials,The full-length textile Mesh feels good in-hand and is very comfortable on-foot.
11456,266,6,9.0,2019-04-06,materials,The full-mesh upper is implemented nicely and provides the containment you need. The materials are probably one of the best feature of this shoe.
11457,266,45,9.0,2019-06-11,support,"The TPU barriers on both sides provide great stability on lateral cuts, and the lockdown of the heel counter and lacing system are top-notch."
11458,266,365,9.0,2019-04-06,support,"The stable and wide base, massive outriggers and TPU overlays on the side provide excellent support."
11459,266,293,9.0,2019-04-06,support,No issues whatsoever!
11460,266,6,8.0,2019-04-06,support,"For some reason, on my right foot, I did experience a little bit of heel slip. The forefoot lockdown was good and there was no side-to-side movement thanks to the TPU barriers on the sides."
11461,266,45,8.0,2019-06-11,fit,"The lacing system is really basic, but get's the job done!"
11462,266,365,9.0,2019-04-06,fit,The traditional lacing system lets you customize the fit to your feet and midfoot / heel lockdown are excellent.
11463,266,293,9.0,2019-04-06,fit,The fit is really good for me - super cozy!
11464,266,6,8.0,2019-04-06,fit,"Overall, the fit is pretty nice but the materials in the toebox bunched up a little bit on my pair."
11465,266,45,100.0,2019-06-11,outdoor,The Pro Bounce Madness performs very well outdoors.

11474,267,33,9.0,2019-02-23,expert_overall,"I hated the PG3 after my first few hours in them. However, I’m glad I stuck with them as by the end of the week I was just excited to lace them up for another few hours of pick-up runs"
11475,267,45,8.6,2019-03-07,expert_overall,Easily the best PG sneaker so far! This is one of my favorite Nike shoes in a long time.
11476,267,522,8.6,2019-03-19,expert_overall,The PG3 gives you everything you want in a low top for a lower-than-average price. I have zero complaints!
11477,267,76,9.0,2023-06-17,user_overall,"responsive as hell. traction looks like it picks up dust but it doesn’t effect it. forefoot zoom is bouncy and foam is as soft as cushlon, a lot better than other shoes with the same tech. wings on the side and half bootie is comfy while still having rediculous lockdown "
11478,267,685,8.6,2022-04-03,user_overall,"I wore these for awhile and I really liked them, the traction was good no matter where I played. I liked this color way especially, but I think most of the color ways looked kind of basic. It was a little smaller that I’d thought it would be but it still felt good on my normal size, so I would ultimately say that you can get your normal size just expect it to be tight at first. Also takes a minute to break in"
11479,267,686,8.4,2022-02-22,user_overall,"This was my first ""pro"" basketball shoe, so I can't really compare, but It's a good shoe just out of the box. The only thing I can point out is the materials though. It's a really stiff material and it doesnt break in quickly."
11480,267,687,9.2,2023-08-11,user_overall,One of the most complete shoes of all time. Great cushioning in the forefoot and the heel. Moon traction pattern is elite. Support and lockdown with the lacing is secure. GOAT shoe and a must buy.
11481,267,688,8.8,2022-05-11,user_overall,"I had the NASA (orange) PG3 colorway. Ran hoops in these for a solid 2 years. Great fit, and didn’t require any break-in period. Solid traction. Phenomenal indoor shoe."

11483,267,293,9.0,2019-02-01,traction,"The circle traction pattern is soo nice!  On a clean court, you are sticking like glue and even dusty courts are not a big issue."
11484,267,32,9.0,2019-02-11,traction,"The ""moon crater"" traction pattern has you covered in every direction."
11485,267,33,9.0,2019-02-23,traction,"Traction started out really poor, but now they are super consistent and require almost no wiping."
11486,267,45,9.0,2019-03-07,traction,"Wow, did we stick to the court!"
11487,267,522,9.0,2019-03-19,traction,"Soft rubber, multi-directional coverage, and nice depth allow the traction to do its job."
11488,267,365,9.0,2019-02-11,cushion,"The Zoom Air unit in the front is responsive and bouncy, the Phylon in the heel is comfortable enough so I didn't have issues playing for hours."

11492,267,45,9.0,2019-03-07,cushion,"We got court feel, comfort, response, and durability. And who doesn't like forefoot Zoom?"
11493,267,522,9.0,2019-03-19,cushion,Big forefoot Zoom sits in a slightly softer and bouncier foam carrier.
11494,267,365,9.0,2019-02-11,materials,"The materials don't scream ""signature sneaker"" but they function exactly how I would like them to."

11496,267,32,7.0,2019-02-11,materials,"The mesh material on the upper is pretty rough and feels ""plasticky"". Overall, the materials feel pretty cheap and are a downgrade compared to previous models."

11498,267,45,8.0,2019-03-07,materials,The break-in period was minimal and the materials feel really good.
11499,267,522,8.0,2019-03-19,materials,Nike has made the materials a little less premium since the PG 1.

11502,267,32,8.0,2019-02-11,support,"The forefoot wings, internal heel counter, and ankle collar provide a lot of support and containment."
11503,267,33,9.0,2019-02-23,support,I would have liked a slightly wider base and an outrigger but I never encountered any issues.
11504,267,45,8.0,2019-03-07,support,"The support comes from 3 things: internal heel counter, the lockdown of the lacing system and sturdy materials, and the lateral outrigger that provides a lot of stability."
11505,267,522,8.0,2019-03-19,support,Zero issues overall with support and stability on the PG3.
11506,267,365,9.5,2019-02-11,fit,"After a little break-in time, the fit was near perfect for me."

11518,268,32,9.5,2019-02-23,expert_overall,"I promise you will not get disappointed if you pick the Dame 5. If the cushioning was a little softer and the traction a little better on dusty courts, this shoe might have received the first ever perfect rating from me."
11519,268,176,9.0,2019-02-23,expert_overall,This is the best Dame shoe yet and that is saying a lot! The Dame 5 combines the best categories of the previous models and gives us a shoe that any player can wear and feel strong.
11520,268,33,8.9,2020-04-26,expert_overall,"The Dame 5 is solid all the way around: great traction, great cushion, superior lockdown, wonderful support, and stability."
11521,268,6,8.8,2019-02-23,expert_overall,"At $115, the Dame 5 is a very good performance basketball shoe. The traction took a while to break in, but other than that, everything about this shoe is really nice."
11522,268,45,8.8,2019-03-07,expert_overall,The Adidas Dame 5 is an incredible shoe. The Bounce cushioning is absolutely amazing and the herringbone traction pattern is close to perfect.
11523,268,522,8.6,2019-02-23,expert_overall,"Get the basics down and you have a great shoe. Thank you Adidas and Dame! This is the best Dame ever, as Adidas finally found the right combo of everything, especially traction."
11524,268,293,8.0,2019-02-23,expert_overall,"I really enjoyed playing in the Dame 5 on clean courts. The cushion is pretty damn nice, materials are nice, fit is good and it's also very supportive. This is a solid performer at a very fair price. Just make sure you don't get the translucent rubber versions if you plan to play on dusty courts."
11525,268,689,9.0,2021-11-04,user_overall,"I've had them for almost 4 months now, and I got them with the pure intention of playing outside basketball. They've held up perfectly. Not a single scratch, and I've played under some rough conditions.  The shoes require some wiping in case you play on sandy courts, but otherwise the traction is great. There is some dead space in the front of the shoe, but once you get used to it, it's actually very comfortable and makes the shoes"
11526,268,396,8.8,2021-11-09,user_overall,"The first performance basketball shoes I have acquired being a more or less concsious consumer. Pros include stepping comfort, nice balance between impact protection and court feel and of course the PILLOW PARADISE inside the sneaker. Being a heavy wing type of player I prefer laterally stable shoes with above average impact protection, and Dame 5 deliver that. Impact protection is not sufficient on the outdoor surfaces though. Questionable grip for translucent outsoles."
11527,268,136,8.3,2022-06-20,user_overall,"I was very disappointed with them. I came from the best shoe I ever had (dame 4) and decided to try the next chapter on the dame series, but oh my. Materials were kind of cheap and the traction was worst than the 4s. Ankle support was good tho. First try I used them outside, and some of the materials from the top broke because of my change of directions. Decent performer but disappointing knowing the previous Dame 4. It’s not even a good-looking shoe."
11528,268,643,8.4,2021-11-21,user_overall,"Phenomenal support with and wide base and stable cushioning. The traction on dusty indoor courts is not great, so I ultimately began using these as my go-to outdoor shoes and they have been amazing for that. The rubber grips surfaced, concrete, and asphalt outdoor courts really well."

11530,268,32,9.0,2019-02-23,traction,"The traction on the Dame 5 is money! It's squeaky, it's got the grip and it let's you stop on a dime. On dusty courts, there are slight slipping problems."
11531,268,176,10.0,2019-02-23,traction,The fairly wide and deep herringbone pattern grips on every move and lets me accelerate quickly with no slips.
11532,268,33,9.0,2020-04-26,traction,The herringbone traction is thick and widely spaced apart. It worked well on all courts and picked up very little dust.
11533,268,6,8.0,2019-02-23,traction,"Adidas is sticking to traditional herringbone traction pattern. The traction takes a little time to break in and can be problematic on dusty courts. On clean courts, you will be stopping on a dime!"
11534,268,45,9.0,2019-03-07,traction,"Multi-directional herringbone with thick and wide grooves. If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
11535,268,522,9.0,2019-02-23,traction,The traction worked great when clean or freshly wiped with some occasional wiping on dusty floors.
11536,268,293,7.0,2019-02-23,traction,"On clean courts, you have a really, really nice stop! But on dusty courts it is horrible. The colorways with translucent rubber pick up dust like crazy."
11537,268,32,9.0,2019-02-23,cushion,"Full-length Bounce cushioning feels low-to-the-ground, responsive and springy. I would have liked a little more cushioning in the forefoot though."
11538,268,176,9.5,2019-02-23,cushion,"The Bounce cushioning is thick, bouncy, quick and responsive. I especially love the smooth heel-to-toe transition."
11539,268,33,9.0,2020-04-26,cushion,I absolutely love the ride that thicker Bounce cushioning of the Dame 5 provides.
11540,268,6,9.0,2019-02-23,cushion,I really like the Bounce cushioning because it provides a lot of court feel and responsiveness while also providing good impact protection.
11541,268,45,9.0,2019-03-07,cushion,"The Bounce cushioning is our favorite part of the Dame 5. Response, comfort, durability, it's all taken care off."
11542,268,522,8.0,2019-02-23,cushion,The cushioning is a nice blend of court feel and impact protection.
11543,268,293,8.0,2019-02-23,cushion,"Court feel is really good, the heel has a nice bounce and the heel-to-toe transition is great. Overall, this is a nice combination of responsiveness and impact protection that should work well, especially for guards."
11544,268,32,9.0,2019-02-23,materials,The materials are nice and soft and feel great on your feet.
11545,268,176,7.0,2019-02-23,materials,I am not a big fan of the felt/suede material.
11546,268,33,7.0,2020-04-26,materials,There are Mesh and leather colorways but the materials don't exactly feel premium on either one. They perform without any problems though.
11547,268,6,8.0,2019-02-23,materials,"The performance of the materials works fine, but I am not a fan of how the felt material used on my colorway looks and feels."
11548,268,45,9.0,2019-03-07,materials,"Materials are soft, breathable, flexible and comfortable. Everything you want out of basketball shoe materials!"
11549,268,522,8.0,2019-02-23,materials,Mesh and some suede or synthetic suede. Not bad I guess if you’re looking for value.
11550,268,293,8.0,2019-02-23,materials,"Overall, the materials feel nice on-foot but don't exactly look or feel premium."
11551,268,32,9.0,2019-02-23,support,"The support on the Dame 5 is great thanks to the wide base, Achilles pillows and TPU caging on the lateral side."
11552,268,176,9.0,2019-02-23,support,The support is based primarily on the lacing system and the TPU lateral support wing.
11553,268,33,10.0,2020-04-26,support,"The lockdown is amazing, and your feet sit deep in the midsole of the wide base which gives you unmatched stability."
11554,268,6,10.0,2019-02-23,support,"I think the support in the Dame 5 is phenomenal! No side-to-side movement, no heel slippage, and your feet are sitting slightly inside the Bounce cushioning which provides great containment."
11555,268,45,8.0,2019-03-07,support,"With soft and flexible materials like in the Dame, support can't be a 10/10. But the internal heel counter, wide base, and lateral TPU overlay keep you on the footbed and prevent any heel slippage or sliding."
11556,268,522,9.0,2019-02-23,support,Stability is excellent with a low to the ground set up and very wide outsole.
11557,268,293,9.0,2019-02-23,support,"The TPU caging on the lateral side keeps you on the footbed, the lateral outrigger keeps you stable, and several Achilles pillows make sure that there is no heel slip."
11558,268,32,10.0,2019-02-23,fit,These shoes are insanely comfortable!
11559,268,176,9.5,2019-02-23,fit,Probably the best-fitting Dame shoe so far. The materials are soft and comfortable and the lacing system does a great job locking down your feet.
11560,268,33,9.5,2020-04-26,fit,The lacing system and internal padding give you an amazing lockdown.
11561,268,6,9.0,2019-02-23,fit,"Your foot is locked down perfectly by the lacing system, but there is a little bit of dead space in the toe box."
11562,268,45,9.0,2019-03-07,fit,"The fit is snug, secure and soft. What more do you want?"
11563,268,522,9.0,2019-02-23,fit,"No heel slip, side to side movement, or banging of the toes."
11564,268,293,8.0,2019-02-23,fit,The fit is pretty nice except a little bit of dead space in the toe box.
11565,268,45,100.0,2019-03-07,outdoor,Outdoors - you will be good to go!
11566,268,293,100.0,2019-02-23,outdoor,The rubber is pretty hard and thick and I didn't experience any fraying - so outdoors should be good.
11567,268,6,3,2019-02-23,width,Slight wide-footers can go down half a size like everybody else. If you have very wide feet then stay true to size.
11568,268,293,2,2019-02-23,width,The fit is a little bit on the narrow side.
11569,268,6,4,2019-02-23,size,Go down half a size.
11570,268,45,3,2019-03-07,size,True to size.
11571,268,522,5,2019-02-23,size,These run long so I’d advise half a size down for everyone but the maybe widest of wide footers.
11572,268,293,5,2019-02-23,size,"The Dame 5 runs super long. Go down half a size, if you have narrow feet you could even go down a full size."
11573,269,293,8.8,2019-02-23,expert_overall,"This is a solid, solid performer, especially at the price of $110. The traction is excellent, the cushioning is soft, and the materials are pretty nice and comfortable."
11574,269,33,8.8,2019-02-23,expert_overall,"The traction on this shoe is absolutely awesome and the Micro G cushioning feels really good. Unfortunately, the fit wasn't perfect for my feet."
11575,269,6,8.8,2019-03-12,expert_overall,"For $110 you really can't go wrong with the Anatomix Spawn Low. It doesn't have the big-name brand attached, and the looks might not be amazing, but the performance is top notch!"
11576,269,176,8.8,2019-04-06,expert_overall,"If you are looking for a low, fast, cushioned ride that will draw some attention for the looks and colors, the Anatomix Spawn is it."
11577,269,522,8.4,2019-03-07,expert_overall,"Even though this shoe has very little in common with its predecessors, it performs very well all around with excellent traction and a pretty good fit if you ignore the bubbles in the forefoot. I prefer these over the Curry 6 when it comes to performance."
11578,269,45,8.2,2019-04-06,expert_overall,"This is my favorite Under Armour shoe so far! I love the fit, the Micro G cushioning, and the excellent traction."
11579,269,455,8.4,2022-02-09,user_overall,"I personally really liked these shoes. They gripped incredibly, and i quite literally never slipped. The cushion is nice and plush, yet reactive which is great for guards who want comfy cushion. The issue is with the way the upper is built. The materials bunch up in the forefoot and cause a pinching sensation that isn’t the nicest but wearing thick socks improved it. All in all, great shoes for indoor players who rarely go on outdoor courts."

11584,269,33,10.0,2019-02-23,traction,Traction was beastly. Straight up beastly.
11585,269,6,10.0,2019-03-12,traction,"The traction is freaking insane! Whether I played on a clean court, or on a dusty court, there were no problems at all!"
11586,269,176,10.0,2019-04-06,traction,"On all courts, the Spawn locked it down with no slipping at all!"
11587,269,522,9.0,2019-03-07,traction,The traction is definitely the highlight of the shoe.
11588,269,45,9.0,2019-04-06,traction,"Everything about the traction pattern is A1. Requires very little wiping, even on dusty courts."
11589,269,293,9.0,2019-02-23,cushion,"The Micro G feels a lot firmer than we are used too from the Clutchfit Drive or the original Spawn. I like the balance between impact protection, court feel, and response."
11590,269,33,9.0,2019-02-23,cushion,The Micro G cushion is well-balanced offering court feel and impact protection.
11591,269,6,9.0,2019-03-12,cushion,"I kinda like the firmer Micro G. It's still soft, but not mushy and gives you a great balance between impact protection and court feel."
11592,269,176,9.0,2019-04-06,cushion,Impact protection is outstanding and court feel is really nice and quick.
11593,269,522,8.0,2019-03-07,cushion,"This version of Micro G slightly firmer than stock Micro G and a good blend of court feel, impact protection, and bounce."
11594,269,45,9.0,2019-04-06,cushion,The MicroG cushioning provides a lot of court feel in the forefoot and impact protection in the heel. It also doesn't bottom out which makes it very durable.
11595,269,293,8.0,2019-02-23,materials,The foam-backed mesh is soft and pliable. Doesn't feel very premium in-hand but is very comfortable on-foot.
11596,269,33,9.0,2019-02-23,materials,The lightweight mesh offers support right where you need it and flex where you’d want it.
11597,269,6,8.0,2019-03-12,materials,The mesh materials don't feel premium but they definitely get the job done!
11598,269,176,9.0,2019-04-06,materials,"Not the most premium feel in-hand, but the materials work well on-foot."
11599,269,522,8.0,2019-03-07,materials,"I don't care about materials but the materials of the original Under Armour Spawn look and feel far more premium. However, this version of the Spawn is far more plush and layered."
11600,269,45,8.0,2019-04-06,materials,Break-in time is close to zero.
11601,269,293,9.0,2019-02-23,support,Lateral containment is good and the lacing system gives you a lot of flexibility to achieve great lockdown even when you have narrow feet.
11602,269,33,9.0,2019-02-23,support,Support is pretty standard.
11603,269,6,9.0,2019-03-12,support,The support in the Anatomix Spawn is phenomenal. No heel slippage or side-to-side movement.
11604,269,176,9.0,2019-04-06,support,"Midfoot shank. Wide base. Wide lacing. Lateral wing tied into the lacing system. NO OUTRIGGER, but no problem."
11605,269,522,9.0,2019-03-07,support,Stability is great with a nice flat outsole and wide forefoot.
11606,269,45,7.0,2019-04-06,support,Support was very solid for a low-top shoe with minimal material usage.
11607,269,293,8.0,2019-02-23,fit,"Not as easy to put on as many other modern hoops shoes, but overall, the fit is pretty nice."
11608,269,33,7.0,2019-02-23,fit,There was some unwanted dead space in the toe box.
11609,269,6,8.0,2019-03-12,fit,"I experienced some irritation of a rubber piece digging into my forefoot in the beginning, but overall the fit is pretty nice."
11610,269,176,7.0,2019-04-06,fit,"The fit isn't bad, but it's confusing. The toe-box and midfoot are a little too wide for my feet but the heel is narrow."
11611,269,522,8.0,2019-03-07,fit,No movement side to side and almost zero heel slip out of the box.
11612,269,45,8.0,2019-04-06,fit,The padding and the lacing system feel really nice and provide great lockdown.
11613,269,293,0.0,2019-02-23,outdoor,"The rubber is very soft and pliable, don't play outdoors!"
11614,269,6,0.0,2019-03-12,outdoor,"The rubber starts fraying quickly, not recommended for outdoor use."
11615,269,522,0.0,2019-03-07,outdoor,Not recommended for outdoor use.
11616,269,45,0.0,2019-04-06,outdoor,"The traction pattern is wearing out quickly, not recommended for outdoor use."
11617,269,6,3,2019-03-12,width,I didn't have any issues with the width as a slightly wide-footer.
11618,269,6,4,2019-03-12,size,I'd suggest going down half a size.
11619,269,522,3,2019-03-07,size,I think most everyone can go true to size comfortably.
11620,269,45,3,2019-04-06,size,True to size.
11621,270,32,9.0,2019-03-07,expert_overall,"Even though this isn't really a performance upgrade to the Kobe 4, this is still a really good performance shoe. However, I don't think they are worth $175."
11622,270,522,8.6,2019-03-07,expert_overall,I love that Nike didn’t change a thing. And why should they when it’s one of the best low tops of all time?
11623,270,293,8.6,2019-03-07,expert_overall,"This shoe feels more Retro than Protro. They will probably make it into my rotation, but the price of $175 is pretty steep."
11624,270,33,8.6,2019-03-11,expert_overall,"The Nike Kobe 4 is one of the greatest basketball shoes of all-time but I expected the inclusion of forefoot cushion for a performance-upgraded shoe. For $175 they could have, and should have, given us more."
11625,270,6,8.5,2019-07-07,expert_overall,"The Protro 4 is a very solid performer - if you are a Kobe fan get them! But at the price of $175, there are way better shoes out there."
11626,270,221,8.5,2019-09-26,expert_overall,"For $175, these feel like a sneaker from 2009 trying to keep up in 2019."
11627,270,691,9.6,2021-11-22,user_overall,"It is a shoe that fits perfectly, it might feel a bit stiff at the start, but once you break in the leather starts working its magic and it FITS like a glove. The cushion is good but only enough for a center. I feel like I would like it to have a bit more like the KD 14's. The durability is okay, I played outdoors with it twice and i see no big wear and tear with my outsole."
11628,270,71,9.6,2022-03-19,user_overall,Amazing experience playing with these shoes. Would have taken better care of them if I’d knew how rare they rare. Unfortunately after playing with them outdoors the lower outer part of the shoe laces got ripped off after a year or so :(
11629,270,565,9.6,2023-03-02,user_overall,This shoe is what i wanted because it has amazing traction&cushion good fit&materials overall i recommend this shoe
11630,270,692,9.5,2024-07-23,user_overall,"Love the shoe, the air unit on the heel you can feel I wish that it had more durability"
11631,270,15,8.7,2022-11-17,user_overall,Not a bad shoe but not the best Kobe shoe but again it's not bad
11632,270,32,9.0,2019-03-07,traction,The traction is aggressive and works well. Some wiping is needed on dusty courts.
11633,270,522,9.0,2019-03-07,traction,This herringbone traction pattern is just about as perfect as you can get.
11634,270,293,8.0,2019-03-07,traction,"Most Kobes have a crazy bite, but these were a little disappointing on dusty courts."
11635,270,33,9.0,2019-03-11,traction,The Kobe 4 Protro offers the same pattern and the same soft bite as the original Kobe 4.
11636,270,6,9.0,2019-07-07,traction,"The traction was a little iffy at first, but after the break-in period, it was really nice."
11637,270,221,10.0,2019-09-26,traction,The traction is amazing!
11638,270,32,8.0,2019-03-07,cushion,Springy and bouncy Zoom in the heel and soft and responsive in the forefoot.
11639,270,522,8.0,2019-03-07,cushion,Heel Zoom is fantastic and can be felt from day one.  I didn’t have any issues at with the forefoot (yet) but I would have loved full-length Zoom.
11640,270,293,9.0,2019-03-07,cushion,The Zoom unit in the heel is really nice but the forefoot is pretty dead. I am a big fan of this setup because it's very responsive and low-to-the-ground.
11641,270,33,7.0,2019-03-11,cushion,There is a Phylon midsole and a large volume Zoom Air unit in the heel. The setup feels similar to the original but the foam seems to be a bit softer.
11642,270,6,8.0,2019-07-07,cushion,"Bounce Zoom unit in the heel and firmer Phylon in the forefoot. Nothing to complain, but there are better cushioning setups out there."
11643,270,221,8.0,2019-09-26,cushion,"The Phylon forefoot and heel Zoom are a little disappointing, especially since Nike promised us full-length Zoom."
11644,270,32,8.0,2019-03-07,materials,"We still get synthetic leather and plasticky mid-panels. They absolutely get the job done, but I would have loved an upgrade to the materials."
11645,270,522,8.0,2019-03-07,materials,The materials feel plasticky feel they confirmed to my foot quickly with no hot spots or pinching!
11646,270,293,8.0,2019-03-07,materials,You need to break-in the materials for a little bit. I am not a big fan of synthetic materials but they are super durable and will last for a long time.
11647,270,33,9.0,2019-03-11,materials,It works. It’s durable. It breaks in nicely.
11648,270,6,8.0,2019-07-07,materials,Not exactly the best materials. The synthetic leather starts off really stiff but gets better over time. The durability of the materials will be very good.
11649,270,221,8.0,2019-09-26,materials,The materials perform fine but feel a bit old-fashioned.
11650,270,522,9.0,2019-03-07,support,Support comes from the excellent fit and heel counter and the stability is excellent thanks to the large outrigger.
11651,270,293,10.0,2019-03-07,support,"This shoe is crazy supportive, no issues with lateral containment or lockdown."
11652,270,33,9.0,2019-03-11,support,"The heel counter, carbon shank, and wide forefoot provide a lot of support and stability."
11653,270,6,9.0,2019-07-07,support,"An external heel counter, lateral outrigger, carbon fiber midfoot shank. Nothing spectacular -  but I didn't have any support issues at all!"
11654,270,221,8.0,2019-09-26,support,"The support is really good, especially for a low-top."
11655,270,32,8.0,2019-03-07,fit,The comfort of this shoe is slightly above average. I did have pinching issues around the ankles when lacing them very tightly.
11656,270,522,9.0,2019-03-07,fit,Even half a size up I had zero heel slip no side to side movement and it still fit like a glove.
11657,270,293,8.0,2019-03-07,fit,"I did have slight issues with the top eyelet sawing into my ankle bone. But, overall, the fit was pretty good."
11658,270,33,9.0,2019-03-11,fit,The fit is awesome.
11659,270,293,0.0,2019-03-07,outdoor,The rubber is pretty soft and frays easily.
11660,270,293,4,2019-03-07,width,The fit is not as narrow as I am used to from the Kobe line.
11661,270,6,2,2019-07-07,width,As a slightly wide-footer I experienced a little pinching pain around the forefoot.
11662,270,522,3,2019-03-07,size,I suggest true to size for regular feet and half a size up for wide footers.
11663,270,293,4,2019-03-07,size,Runs a little bit long.
11664,270,6,3,2019-07-07,size,I went true to size.
11665,271,176,8.6,2019-05-28,expert_overall,"The Puma Uproar is a fun shoe! If you are looking for a moderately-cushioned shoe with near-perfect lockdown and traction, look no further."
11666,271,33,8.6,2019-04-12,expert_overall,"Puma really has impressed me quite a bit. The cushioning could be a little better, but everything else worked perfectly!"
11667,271,293,8.0,2019-03-07,expert_overall,I enjoyed playing in these. This shoe is a jack of all trades but master of none.
11668,271,515,7.8,2022-08-18,user_overall,
11669,271,176,9.0,2019-05-28,traction,"Initially, I slipped a little bit, but it seemed like the rubber became better the more I played in them."
11670,271,33,9.0,2019-04-12,traction,The Blade traction pattern worked reliably on all courts I played on.
11671,271,293,8.0,2019-03-07,traction,"On a clean court, you get good stops and even on dusty courts, it's never horrible. But even if you wipe a lot, you will never feel glued to the floor."
11672,271,176,7.0,2019-05-28,cushion,"The heel cushioning is nice, but I'd wish there was a little more impact protection in the forefoot."
11673,271,33,7.0,2019-04-12,cushion,The cushioning setup is pretty firm and provides a lot of court feel but only very little bounce back.
11674,271,293,7.0,2019-03-07,cushion,"The cushioning is super firm and compresses very little. Court feel is good and impact protection wasn't horrible, but this shoe just doesn't feel comfortable."
11675,271,176,9.0,2019-05-28,materials,"Materials differ from colorway to colorway. I like the synthetic leather/leather materials and old-school construction of the ""Palace Guard"" colorway."
11676,271,33,9.0,2019-04-12,materials,Once the materials are broken-in you are good to go!
11677,271,293,7.0,2019-03-07,materials,The textile materials and synthetic leather feel cheap in-hand but work well on-foot.
11678,271,176,9.0,2019-05-28,support,"A very stable and supportive shoe thanks to the wide, solid base and the way your feet sit deep in the midsole."
11679,271,33,9.0,2019-04-12,support,"There are heel counters and a stable, wide base for stability - but no outrigger."
11680,271,293,9.0,2019-03-07,support,I felt very stable and locked down.
11681,271,176,9.0,2019-05-28,fit,The thick foam wraps on the heel and ankle prevent any side-to-side movement or heel slip and the lacing system provides a ton of lockdown.
11682,271,33,9.0,2019-04-12,fit,Lockdown is awesome and the lacing system works perfectly from ankle to forefoot.
11683,271,293,9.0,2019-03-07,fit,No dead space at all!
11684,271,293,100.0,2019-03-07,outdoor,Should work well outdoors!
11685,271,293,3,2019-03-07,width,Width-wise the fit is normal.
11686,272,293,8.6,2019-03-07,expert_overall,Even ignoring the fast-fit adaptive lacing system - this is a really nice performance basketball shoe. On top of that - this is a real head-turner!
11687,272,45,8.6,2019-05-08,expert_overall,The first-ever self-lacing basketball shoe is here - and it's one of the best basketball shoes we have ever played in.
11688,272,6,8.4,2019-05-08,expert_overall,"The Nike Adapt BB is a good performance basketball shoe. But there are better performers for much cheaper. So if you are a sneakerhead, or really into innovative tech, then this is a great shoe!"
11689,272,221,8.2,2019-04-06,expert_overall,I had a lot of fun playing in the Nike Adapt BB. The self-lacing system works well and the overall performance is really solid. Pick these up if you are interested in the latest tech and you can afford the hefty price tag!
11690,272,693,9.2,2021-11-10,user_overall,
11691,272,293,8.0,2019-03-07,traction,"The circle and lines traction pattern using translucent rubber is screaming loud and works really well on clean courts. On dusty courts, you will need a while to break-in but it never gets really good."
11692,272,45,9.0,2019-05-08,traction,The traction performance is beasty!
11693,272,6,8.0,2019-05-08,traction,"Even though the rubber is translucent I found the traction to be rather good. Works very well on clean courts, but dusty courts can be problematic."
11694,272,221,9.0,2019-04-06,traction,"The traction is clearly the best performance aspect of the Nike Adapt BB! Squeaky, responsive, but a little inconsistent on dusty courts."
11695,272,293,9.0,2019-03-07,cushion,The Cushlon cushioning is super nice. Really nice compression in the heel and super bouncy. The only downside is that you don't get a ton of court feel.
11696,272,45,8.0,2019-05-08,cushion,"I love the full-length Cushlon cushioning setup, but I would have preferred to see a Lunarlon or React setup."
11697,272,6,8.0,2019-05-08,cushion,"The full-length Cushlon insole feels super comfortable, especially in the heel! I really like the cushioning setup, but for $350 I had hoped for a little more."
11698,272,221,8.0,2019-04-06,cushion,Full-length Cushlon is nice - but not the best cushion system Nike has to offer.
11699,272,293,9.0,2019-03-07,materials,The materials are super nice and feel great on foot.
11700,272,45,9.0,2019-05-08,materials,"Nike used some of their best materials, and they all came together really nicely! Light, breathable, flexible and the break-in time is minimal."
11701,272,6,10.0,2019-05-08,materials,The materials look nice and feel really premium.
11702,272,221,9.0,2019-04-06,materials,The materials are soft and supportive.
11703,272,293,8.0,2019-03-07,support,"Support is good overall, but I felt a little bit wobbly because your feet are pretty high off-the-ground."
11704,272,45,8.0,2019-05-08,support,"Outrigger, internal heel counter, external heel clip, and great overall lockdown coming from the lacing system."
11705,272,6,8.0,2019-05-08,support,"I didn't have any heel slippage and no side-to-side movement in the forefoot. The shoe felt a little bit ""tippy"" at times, mostly because of the soft cushioning."
11706,272,221,7.0,2019-04-06,support,The support of the Adapt BB is kind of clunky.
11707,272,293,9.0,2019-03-07,fit,The adaptive fit system is insane! Don't worry that you can't get it tight enough - this system will crank your laces tighter than you ever could!
11708,272,45,9.0,2019-05-08,fit,The self-lacing mechanism does an amazing job and remembers the perfect fit. This is really a smart shoe!
11709,272,6,8.0,2019-05-08,fit,The self-adjusting automatic system really works! But you won't be able to customize your fit like you are able with regular laces.
11710,272,221,8.0,2019-04-06,fit,The fit is pretty good for what it is. But I feel that a traditional lacing system allows you to better customize the fit to your feet.
11711,272,293,50.0,2019-03-07,outdoor,"The rubber is super soft, but we didn't experience a lot of fraying."
11712,272,45,0.0,2019-05-08,outdoor,Would I take this shoe outdoors? No!
11713,272,6,2,2019-05-08,width,"Runs a little bit narrow, especially in the forefoot."
11714,272,6,3,2019-05-08,size,Runs true to size.
11715,273,33,9.0,2019-01-06,expert_overall,The Curry 6 is easily the best shoe in the Curry signature line.
11716,273,615,9.0,2019-01-06,expert_overall,I am loving the Curry 6! Definitely the #1 in my rotation right now.
11717,273,32,9.0,2019-01-13,expert_overall,"In my opinion, this is the best Curry signature shoe since the Curry 2. Everything about this shoe is great, except the pain I experienced on the top of the feet when cranking the laces tightly."
11718,273,6,9.0,2019-01-13,expert_overall,"The Curry 6 is a really fun performer that has everything I want from a basketball shoe: amazing cushion, amazing fit, and while the traction is not quite on Curry 2 level, it is still pretty nice! The durability of the rubber on my pair was an issue though..."
11719,273,176,9.0,2019-02-01,expert_overall,"The Curry 6 brings a great combo of traction, cushioning and support to make fast basketball player very happy!"
11720,273,86,9.0,2019-02-23,expert_overall,This is easily the most well-rounded Curry we’ve had since the 1.
11721,273,293,8.4,2019-01-09,expert_overall,"I really enjoy playing in the Curry 6. The cushioning is pretty nice, the traction, fit, support and the minimal upper are really fun. The only problem is the durability of my pair - let's hope the glue work is better on future colorways!"
11722,273,45,8.2,2019-02-01,expert_overall,"Easily the best Curry signature shoe! The cushioning is amazing, materials are really nice, the traction took care of us, only the support was a little bit of a letdown."
11723,273,522,8.0,2019-01-17,expert_overall,"The Curry 6 looks good, has great traction and is very stable, but the constant lace pressure, bad heel fit, and a really dumb outsole design make these far from perfect."
11724,273,497,9.0,2022-01-13,user_overall,"The Under Armour Curry 6 is an amazing shoe for all guards. It is very light and responsive, and it has unbelievable court feel. The traction is amazing, and it is good on dust too! The traction works in all directions. The cushion was pretty good, and it was very responsive with great impact protection. The support was great, and I was locked in! The materials are amazing, and it was very breathable and thin! The durability had some issues, but that was about it. Everything else was phenomenal!"
11725,273,412,8.0,2021-12-13,user_overall,"The shoe has ok comfortability and is ok for its price. It doesn't boast any special tech like a massive airsole or anything, but it makes sense as Curry's play style is very shooting-based and not above the rim much. Material feels somewhat thin and has ok durability. 8.0/10."
11726,273,456,8.8,2022-01-13,user_overall,The Curry 6 is a great shoe. The traction was phenomenal! The cushion in my pair was rock solid and I didn’t enjoy it as much as I wished. However the rest of the shoe checks off all the necessary categories! The Curry 6 is definitely a win!!!
11727,273,694,9.0,2021-11-08,user_overall,I'm on my 2nd pair and would highly recommend them. Doesn't feel like they have traction at first but once broken in they are a very good shoe
11728,273,583,8.5,2023-06-10,user_overall,Very good shoes and light for me. I didn't feel like I was bulky. traction is great for both court but you need to wipe it somethime.
11729,273,33,9.0,2019-01-06,traction,The circular traction pattern on the lateral side offers superb multi-directional grip — dust or no dust
11730,273,615,8.0,2019-01-06,traction,Performance is super nice on clean courts - you will stick like glue! Minimal wiping on dusty courts. Durability is bad though - on the second day the rubber started to separate from the midsole. Let's hope that's just a defect of this colorway.
11731,273,32,9.0,2019-01-13,traction,"The traction was superb! Dust gets stuck in the grooves on the medial side, but a wipe or two will solve that problem."
11732,273,6,9.0,2019-01-13,traction,"The traction performs very well on clean courts but needs some thorough wiping on dustier courts. Unfortunately, the durability of the rubber compound is pretty bad."
11733,273,176,9.0,2019-02-01,traction,"On clean and semi-clean courts, these things stick like Gorilla."
11734,273,86,9.0,2019-02-23,traction,The traction has been pretty consistent for me and a pleasant surprise on the court.
11735,273,293,8.0,2019-01-09,traction,"The performance of the traction was really good, but the durability is an issue. The rubber frays off easily and the split sole design starts to peel off the outsole after a few weeks."
11736,273,45,8.0,2019-02-01,traction,"The traction pattern did its thing, but it did collect a little bit of dust."
11737,273,522,9.0,2019-01-17,traction,Traction is excellent with a great bite on all surfaces with only very occasional wiping.
11738,273,33,9.0,2019-01-06,cushion,The full-length HOVR cushioning is softer and more comfortable than previous Curry models.
11739,273,615,9.0,2019-01-06,cushion,"I love this cushioning setup! Low-profile, great court feel and still pretty comfortable. Major upgrade compared to the Curry 4!"
11740,273,32,9.0,2019-01-13,cushion,"The cushioning is pretty awesome and offers the perfect amount of impact protection and court feel. Overall, the cushioning is a bit on the firm side."
11741,273,6,9.0,2019-01-13,cushion,"The full-length HOVR cushioning gives you a good balance of impact protection and court feel. In my opinion, this is the best cushioning in a Curry shoe so far."
11742,273,176,9.0,2019-02-01,cushion,The cushioning is tuned for optimal impact protection while still keeping you close to the court for those crossovers and step-backs.
11743,273,86,9.0,2019-02-23,cushion,"The full-length HOVR cushioning isn’t overly soft or overly firm, it felt just right for me"
11744,273,293,8.0,2019-01-09,cushion,"Impact protection is okay, but we expected a little more from the new HOVR cushioning. Works well for quick guards looking for a firm, no-nonsense cushioning."
11745,273,45,9.0,2019-02-01,cushion,The HOVR cushioning is very responsive with a lot of court feel and solid impact protection.
11746,273,522,7.0,2019-01-17,cushion,A bit disappointing  - the new full-length HOVR cushioning feels the same as older models.
11747,273,33,9.0,2019-01-06,materials,"After a short break-in period, the full-length Knit is very comfortable but still strong enough to provide lockdown and support."
11748,273,615,9.0,2019-01-06,materials,The full length knit truly feels like a sock!
11749,273,32,8.0,2019-01-13,materials,"The materials are lightweight and breathable, the tongue is soft and stretchy and provides easy entry for your feet. I would have liked a little more padding though."
11750,273,6,9.0,2019-01-13,materials,"Knitted materials with fuse overlays in high-wear areas feel nice, but there was some lace pressure if you like to crank the laces."
11751,273,176,9.0,2019-02-01,materials,The full knit upper with elastic areas is much more comfortable than the Curry 4/5 were.
11752,273,86,9.0,2019-02-23,materials,The full knit upper had some areas of minor discomfort in the beginning but became very comfortable after a while.
11753,273,293,9.0,2019-01-09,materials,"The thin, stretchy and breathable materials feel really nice once you break them in. There was a bit of lace pressure though."
11754,273,45,9.0,2019-02-01,materials,The full knit upper is very supportive and super comfortable. Minimal break-in time required - that's a first in a Curry sneaker!
11755,273,522,8.0,2019-01-17,materials,The knit materials and fuse underlays feel nice and need no break-in time.
11756,273,33,9.0,2019-01-06,support,"The flat and wide base, TPU counter, and external outrigger provide the excellent stability and support we are used to from the Curry line."
11757,273,615,10.0,2019-01-06,support,The support is clearly the best feature of the Curry 6. This is probably the most stable shoe I ever played in!
11758,273,32,9.0,2019-01-13,support,The support is really nice thanks to the full-length speed plate and heel counter.
11759,273,6,9.0,2019-01-13,support,"Like always in the Curry line, the support features are pretty amazing."
11760,273,176,9.0,2019-02-01,support,"The outsole is wide, the midsole is solid and supportive and lateral containment is excellent."
11761,273,86,9.0,2019-02-23,support,Stability has always been one of the strongest features of Curry signature sneakers - and this hasn't changed in the Curry 6!
11762,273,293,8.0,2019-01-09,support,Support was really good. The only slight issue is the lateral containment in the front because the knit is really stretchy.
11763,273,45,6.0,2019-02-01,support,I think this shoe is meant to be worn with an ankle brace.
11764,273,522,9.0,2019-01-17,support,Stability is excellent thanks to an extra wide and flat outsole.
11765,273,33,9.0,2019-01-06,fit,"The fit was a little off in the beginning, but the footbed of the Curry 6 molds to your feet over time and becomes very comfortable."
11766,273,32,7.0,2019-01-13,fit,Fit and lockdown are pretty tricky as I experienced a lot of pain when I laced the shoes too tightly.
11767,273,6,9.0,2019-01-13,fit,The one-bootie upper gives you a pretty good 1:1 fit.
11768,273,176,9.0,2019-02-01,fit,I had to double-sock to keep from having heel slip and forefoot movement.
11769,273,86,9.0,2019-02-23,fit,There was some minor heel slip in the beginning which was easily fixed by a double-sock.
11770,273,293,9.0,2019-01-09,fit,I went down half a size and the fit was awesome for me.
11771,273,45,9.0,2019-02-01,fit,The Curry 6 fits really well! The elastic materials conform to your feet nicely and the lacing system works wonders.
11772,273,522,7.0,2019-01-17,fit,"The stiff midsole, wide ankle collar, and top eyelets which are placed too low combined to create heel slip problems for me."
11773,273,293,0.0,2019-01-09,outdoor,Don't use those outdoors as the rubber will not last very long.
11774,273,45,50.0,2019-02-01,outdoor,I think the Curry 6 should be fine outdoors.
11775,273,6,3,2019-01-13,width,"As a slightly-wide footer, I felt perfectly fine."
11776,273,293,2,2019-01-09,width,Pretty narrow width-wise and snug in the toebox.
11777,273,6,4,2019-01-13,size,The Curry 6 runs a little long but I went true to size.
11778,273,293,4,2019-01-09,size,I went down half a size.
11779,273,522,4,2019-01-17,size,Went down half a size but still had problems with heel slip.
11780,274,33,9.1,2019-02-01,expert_overall,"The Why Not Zero.2 is quick, comfortable, supportive, and breaks in quickly."
11781,274,32,9.0,2019-01-13,expert_overall,"Traction is superb, materials are 50:50, support is solid, cushioning is responsive in the forefoot and comfortable in the heel. There is nothing bad about the Why Not Zero.2, but there is also nothing phenomenal. Not the best shoe I ever played in but a good performer overall."
11782,274,293,9.0,2019-01-17,expert_overall,"I really enjoyed playing in the Jordan Why Not Zero.2. They look great, the price is right, whatever position you play - you are going to enjoy these!"
11783,274,522,9.0,2019-04-06,expert_overall,I’ve literally got nothing to complain about with this shoe. Jordan made the Why Not Zero.2 a lot more fun with a bouncier cushioning set-up while keeping the shoe just great all around.
11784,274,6,8.8,2019-03-11,expert_overall,For $125 this is a really nice shoe - highly recommended! The traction and fit are the outstanding features for me.
11785,274,615,8.3,2019-01-23,expert_overall,Overall this shoe is really dope. The only downside is that the traction is a downgrade compared to the first Russell Westbrook sneaker.
11786,274,221,8.0,2019-03-07,expert_overall,"I think the Jordan Why Not Zero.2 are a solid performer, and fun to play in. But the hefty materials, the uncomfortableness I experienced in the collar area and the uneven support in the heel to forefoot throw them off."
11787,274,45,8.0,2019-04-06,expert_overall,"The cushioning is absolutely amazing and reminds me of the AJ29. This is an amazing overall performer, Russell Westbrook and Jordan Brand should be proud!"
11788,274,71,8.6,2022-03-19,user_overall,Couldn’t figure out what size I should get these in and eventually they ended up being way too long for me to an extent where I always had my socks floating at the front edge of the shoes while playing.

11792,274,33,9.5,2019-02-01,traction,"The traction gripped really well, even on dusty courts."
11793,274,32,9.0,2019-01-13,traction,The solid rubber grabs the floor really hard.
11794,274,293,10.0,2019-01-17,traction,"The circular traction pattern is freaking amazing and gives you great stopping power on clean courts. On dusty courts, it takes you only a slight wipe from time to time."
11795,274,522,9.0,2019-04-06,traction,Excellent bite right out of the box on all surfaces with very little to no wiping on dusty floors.
11796,274,6,9.0,2019-03-11,traction,"The circular pattern gives you coverage in all directions. On dusty courts, you need a slight wipe and you are good to go again."
11797,274,615,7.0,2019-01-23,traction,"The traction worked wonders on clean courts, but once the rubber touched dust I was figure-skating."
11798,274,221,9.0,2019-03-07,traction,"The traction is one of my favorite features of this shoe. Even on a very dirty middle-school court, the traction is tacky and responsive."
11799,274,45,8.0,2019-04-06,traction,"The traction held up well on all courts! Gets the job done, and then some."
11800,274,33,9.0,2019-02-01,cushion,The large volume Zoom Air unit in the forefoot provides a lot of impact protection. The heel is just regular Phylon.
11801,274,32,8.0,2019-01-13,cushion,"No more full-length Zoom, but I am not mad. Forefoot Zoom is nice and there is still a lot of impact protection."
11802,274,293,9.0,2019-01-17,cushion,Bouncy in the forefoot and nice compression in the heel. Court feel could be a little better.
11803,274,522,9.0,2019-04-06,cushion,The  Zoom feels Zoomy and the injected Phylon feels good underfoot from the get-go.
11804,274,6,9.0,2019-03-11,cushion,Decent amount of impact protection in the heel. Very bouncy big-volume Zoom Air unit in the forefoot.
11805,274,615,9.0,2019-01-23,cushion,I love the way the cushioning feels. The perfect combination of bounciness and stiffness.
11806,274,221,9.0,2019-03-07,cushion,Unlocked Zoom in the forefoot and injected Phylon in the midsole. This is a very robust cushioning setup with a ton of impact protection.
11807,274,45,10.0,2019-04-06,cushion,The unlocked Zoom bag feels incredible! Feels back memories of the AJ29.
11808,274,33,9.0,2019-02-01,materials,The mesh and knit materials require zero break-in time and get the job done.
11809,274,32,7.0,2019-01-13,materials,"I'm 50:50 when it comes to materials. I like the mesh in the front, but the heel feels bulky and clunky."
11810,274,293,9.0,2019-01-17,materials,The materials are soft and feel really nice on foot.
11811,274,522,9.0,2019-04-06,materials,These materials LOOK way more premium than most shoes in the 140 under range.
11812,274,6,9.0,2019-03-11,materials,"Different mesh, fuse, and knit materials feel premium and get the job done."
11813,274,615,8.0,2019-01-23,materials,Materials are a little basic - but they work.
11814,274,221,7.0,2019-03-07,materials,I like the mesh in the forefoot and I think that the thick upper materials will last for a long time.
11815,274,45,8.0,2019-04-06,materials,"The textile mesh gets the job done, but takes a while to break in."
11816,274,33,9.0,2019-02-01,support,"Support is good, but not as good as the original."
11817,274,32,9.0,2019-01-13,support,The lacing system really locks in your feet nicely. The beefy internal heel counter makes sure that there is no heel slip at all.
11818,274,293,9.0,2019-01-17,support,"I would have liked the base to be a little wider to increase stability. Overall, support and lockdown are pretty awesome."
11819,274,522,9.0,2019-04-06,support,I had zero issues with support and stability and it’s nice to feel some support around my ankles.
11820,274,6,8.0,2019-03-11,support,"No heel slippage, no side-to-side movement. The base isn't very wide and even a little bit rounded, but I never had any problems."
11821,274,615,9.0,2019-01-23,support,"No lateral movements, no heel slippage, and very good lockdown."
11822,274,221,7.0,2019-03-07,support,The decoupled design of the outsole combined with the narrow and rounded base felt a little too wobbly for me.
11823,274,45,7.0,2019-04-06,support,The support is solid but nothing about it is outstanding.
11824,274,33,9.0,2019-02-01,fit,The fit isn't as tight or suffocating as in the Why Not Zero.1 and worked fine for me.
11825,274,32,8.0,2019-01-13,fit,"The shoe is pretty comfortable overall, but the heel feels a little clunky at times."
11826,274,293,8.0,2019-01-17,fit,The one-bootie construction takes a little to break-in and to get comfortable.
11827,274,522,9.0,2019-04-06,fit,No movement inside the shoe and no heel slip.
11828,274,6,9.0,2019-03-11,fit,The shoe hugs my feet really nicely.
11829,274,221,8.0,2019-03-07,fit,"The midfoot and forefoot fit was solid, but the inside collar area was digging into my foot which didn't work out well with my hurt ankle."
11830,274,45,7.0,2019-04-06,fit,"The padding and heel counter do a great job, but the fit is a little bit long and wide."
11831,274,293,0.0,2019-01-17,outdoor,Outdoor courts? Hell no!
11832,274,45,0.0,2019-04-06,outdoor,The grooves are very malleable and I wouldn't recommend outdoor use.
11833,274,293,2,2019-01-17,width,The fit is pretty narrow and the toe box is rather tight.
11834,274,6,3,2019-03-11,width,I am a slightly wide-footer and I didn't have any problems with these.
11835,274,45,4,2019-04-06,width,The fit is slightly wide.
11836,274,522,3,2019-04-06,size,I went true to size
11837,274,6,3,2019-03-11,size,True to size.
11838,274,45,4,2019-04-06,size,The shoe fits slightly long. Get it a half size-long
11839,275,293,8.3,2019-01-21,expert_overall,I really liked playing in these shoes! If just wished the cushioning was a little more comfortable.
11840,275,33,7.4,2019-03-07,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie Flytrap 2 is a very solid shoe in most aspects, but cushion could definitely use some improvement."
11841,275,681,8.2,2021-11-22,user_overall,"The support is really nice, and the materials feel pretty good. After wearing the shoe for about 6 months or so the sole of my shoe is pretty destroyed, but it is still easy to play in and really just a good shoe to play in; Inside and outside. It is one of the first basketball shoes I've bought. so I'm pretty new to them."
11842,275,696,9.0,2022-05-27,user_overall,This shoe has one of the best tractions I've ever played in. It helped me stop on the dime and helped me with my shiftiness. It's also a super lightweight shoe. My only issues are that it is a super narrow shoe and the cushion isn't the best.
11843,275,697,7.0,2023-02-11,user_overall,It’s not a bad shoe specially for outdoor because the traction is good and the sole is resistant but the cushion is terrible. It feels like you are playing barefoot and it hurts a little when you are running.
11844,275,658,7.8,2022-07-09,user_overall,These aren’t the worst shoes I have ever bought but far from the best these can be used for young players who are smaller and lighter there would be a good shoe in those cases
11845,275,170,7.2,2024-02-16,user_overall,I had about 3 pairs of these when I started playing basketball. They are good if you are in need of support and traction. Good for beginner players on a budget.
11846,275,293,10.0,2019-01-21,traction,The traction is sticking like glue! Even dusty courts are not a problem.
11847,275,33,9.0,2019-03-07,traction,"It didn’t matter which court I was on, the traction just worked."
11848,275,293,4.0,2019-01-21,cushion,The cushioning setup is a no-go if you are looking for impact protection.
11849,275,33,5.0,2019-03-07,cushion,If you’re looking for something plush or bouncy then stay away. Far away.
11850,275,293,9.0,2019-01-21,materials,"At only $80, the textile materials are pretty awesome."
11851,275,33,9.0,2019-03-07,materials,"The textiles have been durable, supportive, lightweight and require little to no break-in time."
11852,275,293,10.0,2019-01-21,support,"Your feet are caged nicely, no heel slippage or side-to-side movement at all."
11853,275,33,7.0,2019-03-07,support,This is a prime example of a mobility shoe and not a stability shoe.
11854,275,33,7.0,2019-03-07,fit,My feet were pushing the textile over the footbed a bit.
11855,275,293,100.0,2019-01-21,outdoor,Outdoor should be good because of the hard rubber and deep grooves.
11856,276,293,8.8,2018-12-14,expert_overall,The $165 is justified by the premium materials and great build quality. This is a great performer with very comfortable cushioning - I thoroughly enjoyed playing in these!
11857,276,615,8.6,2018-12-14,expert_overall,The Wade 7 is a fun shoe to play - definitely recommended!
11858,276,33,7.4,2019-03-07,expert_overall,I am not a big fan of the Wade 7 on-court and I definitely don’t want to play in them again.
11859,276,293,8.0,2018-12-14,traction,"On a clean court, the traction is really good. But this shoe attracts a lot of dust and is rather difficult to wipe."
11860,276,615,7.0,2018-12-14,traction,"The traction was solid; they do pick up dust on dirtier courts but as long as you keep up on your wipes, you will be fine."
11861,276,33,5.0,2019-03-07,traction,"I slipped. Often. Actually, nearly every time I played in them"
11862,276,293,10.0,2018-12-14,cushion,Impact protection in the heel is really nice and the forefoot feels a little like Boost with a very nice compression. This is one of my favorite cushion setups.
11863,276,615,9.0,2018-12-14,cushion,Great impact protection and a very comfortable ride.
11864,276,33,7.0,2019-03-07,cushion,"The step-in comfort is amazing, but they feel pretty dead under-foot."
11865,276,293,9.0,2018-12-14,materials,The materials look and feel super premium and are comfortable on-foot.
11866,276,615,9.0,2018-12-14,materials,The textile mesh upper wrapped my feet nicely but the synthetic shroud in the forefoot did very little for me.
11867,276,33,9.0,2019-03-07,materials,Materials are nice and well-built.
11868,276,293,9.0,2018-12-14,support,"No heel slippage, perfect lateral containment and very stable."
11869,276,615,9.0,2018-12-14,support,The shoe makes sure that our foot is secure and glued to the footbed.
11870,276,33,9.0,2019-03-07,support,"Support is good, but the shoe is very stiff because of it."
11871,276,293,8.0,2018-12-14,fit,There was a little dead space in the front.
11872,276,615,9.0,2018-12-14,fit,I went true-to-size and that works for me.
11873,276,33,7.0,2019-03-07,fit,I couldn't get the right amount of lockdown without my feet going numb from the lace pressure.
11874,276,293,100.0,2018-12-14,outdoor,Outdoor use should be good because of the hard rubber.
11875,277,365,9.1,2019-01-06,expert_overall,This modern take on an old school hoop shoe is a great all-around performer but needs a little patience to break-in.
11876,277,522,8.8,2019-01-06,expert_overall,This might just be the shoe of the year 2018!
11877,277,293,8.8,2019-01-06,expert_overall,The Marquee Boost is a very nice performer at an affordable price - I am impressed!
11878,277,6,8.7,2019-01-06,expert_overall,The Marquee Boost is a great performer but I would recommend the Low version if you like freedom of movement around your ankles.
11879,277,45,8.4,2019-01-13,expert_overall,The most comfortable shoe in the game. Adidas is doing a great job lately!
11880,277,33,8.4,2019-01-17,expert_overall,The Adidas Marquee Boost is definitely one of the more comfortable basketball shoes currently available.
11881,277,586,8.2,2021-10-22,user_overall,"Traction is very nice on clean court, but get you a lot of lateral slippage on dus"
11882,277,396,9.0,2021-11-09,user_overall,"Got the low version for outdoor use only. Highly recommended for such a purpose. Boost cushioning just works perfectly fine on harder surfaces. No problems with traction and the outsole is very durable (not translucent, obviously). Overall very solid shoes. Slightly narrow in midfoot area. Minor setbacks - heel area might be slippery inside when using new socks; the top hole for laces would benefit it was plastic/metallic"
11883,277,645,7.3,2023-02-15,user_overall,"They wore down much quicker then I had hoped there was some of the fabric on the back started to tear and come off, and after not very long the traction was not very good."
11884,277,594,8.0,2021-11-28,user_overall,"Nice shoes, but the support on lateral movement is not that good. The collar is a nice added protection if you start playing after an ankle injury."

11887,277,522,9.0,2019-01-06,traction,"No unnecessary storytelling elements, just simple herringbone that works. Well done Adidas!"
11888,277,293,8.0,2019-01-06,traction,The traction sticks like glue to clean courts but you need to wipe a lot on dusty courts.
11889,277,6,9.0,2019-01-06,traction,The traditional herringbone pattern gives you a super aggressive bite on clean courts but needs occasional wiping on dusty courts.
11890,277,45,7.0,2019-01-13,traction,Basic herringbone has you covered in every direction. Collects a lot of dust on dirty courts.
11891,277,33,7.0,2019-01-17,traction,The thin and tightly spaced herringbone pattern works well on clean courts but gets clogged with dust easily.
11892,277,365,9.5,2019-01-06,cushion,The Boost cushioning setup is everything we love about Boost and suitable for all types of player needs.
11893,277,522,9.0,2019-01-06,cushion,Very comfortable Boost cushioning right out of the box. Very similar setup to the Harden V3.
11894,277,293,10.0,2019-01-06,cushion,The Boost cushioning is A1!
11895,277,6,9.0,2019-01-06,cushion,The Boost setup gives you a nice blend of responsiveness in the forefoot and impact protection in the heel.
11896,277,45,10.0,2019-01-13,cushion,"Boost id life. Comfortable, responsive, impact protection - this shoe does everything exceptionally well!"
11897,277,33,10.0,2019-01-17,cushion,"Full-length Boost and yes, Boost is still life."
11898,277,365,9.0,2019-01-06,materials,"The mix of textile, knit and synthetics feels great in-hand and comfortable on-foot."
11899,277,522,8.0,2019-01-06,materials,"The mesh, fuse, and synthetic leather materials look and feel premium."
11900,277,293,8.0,2019-01-06,materials,The materials feel very nice in-hand and perform very well on foot.
11901,277,6,8.0,2019-01-06,materials,The material usage gets the job done but it's not spectacular.
11902,277,45,9.0,2019-01-13,materials,"Mesh, textiles, and leather come together to provide an insanely comfortable shoe."
11903,277,33,9.0,2019-01-17,materials,"I love the nice mixture of knits, canvas, and micro-molded mesh."
11904,277,365,9.0,2019-01-06,support,No complaints whatsoever!
11905,277,522,9.0,2019-01-06,support,"The rather stiff ankle collar, midfoot shank, and wide outrigger provide great support and stability."
11906,277,293,9.0,2019-01-06,support,"The thick Achilles padding prevents heel slip. You also get good lateral containment, supportive materials, and a very flat and stable outsole."
11907,277,6,9.0,2019-01-06,support,"The ankle collar of the High version is very firm and supportive but limits your mobility a little bit. I experienced no heel slippage,  no side-to-side movements in the footbed, and great lateral stability."
11908,277,45,8.0,2019-01-13,support,"The snug fit, supportive materials, and the caging of the sole provide very good support."
11909,277,33,9.0,2019-01-17,support,"Outrigger, wide platform for stability, heel counter - everything you need is there!"
11910,277,365,9.0,2019-01-06,fit,"In the beginning, there was minor heel slip that went away after the break-in period."
11911,277,522,9.0,2019-01-06,fit,"No movement inside the shoe no heel slip when I laced to the top, no dead space in the toe box."
11912,277,293,9.0,2019-01-06,fit,No dead space anywhere.
11913,277,6,8.5,2019-01-06,fit,"Apart from sizing issues, the fit is pretty nice."
11914,277,45,8.0,2019-01-13,fit,The Marquee Boost takes almost no break-in time and conforms very well to your feet.
11915,277,33,7.0,2019-01-17,fit,The toe area flexes weird and I experienced the dreaded “heel slip” upon my first wears.
11916,277,293,50.0,2019-01-06,outdoor,"The rubber is pretty hard and deep, so you should be okay outdoors."
11917,277,45,100.0,2019-01-13,outdoor,Outdoors you are good to go!
11918,277,293,2,2019-01-06,width,It's slightly narrow and pretty tight.
11919,277,6,3,2019-01-06,width,Wide-footers can go down half a size because the Marquee Boost runs very long.
11920,277,522,4,2019-01-06,size,Go down half a size!
11921,277,293,4,2019-01-06,size,Runs a little bit long.
11922,277,6,5,2019-01-06,size,The Marquee Boost runs very long. I went down half a size but I think I could have gone down a full size.
11923,278,6,9.1,2018-12-17,expert_overall,Adidas really knocked this one out of the park. Really fun to play in!
11924,278,176,8.8,2019-01-06,expert_overall,"Adidas has made a really, REALLY fun shoe. Luckily, the price matched the performance and was truly… N3XT L3V3L."
11925,278,293,8.4,2019-01-06,expert_overall,"I really, really want to like this shoe, but traction is the most important aspect for me, and the Adidas Next Level didn't work on dusty courts. On clean courts, I liked it a lot!"
11926,278,45,8.4,2019-04-06,expert_overall,"Amazing cushion, fantastic herringbone traction, and comfortable Primeknit upper. The fit works out great, even without laces!"
11927,278,522,8.0,2019-02-11,expert_overall,"The N3xt L3v3l is super comfortable and has a nice cushioning setup, but during play, the laceless system just doesn’t work like it should or could."
11928,278,396,9.8,2021-11-09,user_overall,"Due to insane pricing I almost missed on these shoes but was able to find them later in a questionable olive colorway. Probably my favorite ball shoes so far. The first implementation of Lightstrike in basketball and arguably still the best one. The support and stability are surprisingly good, the chassis is very stable. Never experienced problems with traction. The overall comfort is tremendous. Enjoyed playing outdoors once but both upper and outsole are strictly forbidden to be used there."
11929,278,699,8.8,2021-10-27,user_overall,"The shoe was great, It was the traction that killed the 10.0 overall from my view"
11930,278,511,9.0,2021-10-27,user_overall,It's different! Awesome model from adidas. Great traction.

11932,278,6,9.0,2018-12-17,traction,"On clean courts, you will have no problems at all! On dusty courts you need to wipe a lot, otherwise, you will be slipping on lateral as well as linear movements."
11933,278,176,9.0,2019-01-06,traction,Super-grippy on clean and semi-clean courts but you need to wipe a lot on dusty courts.
11934,278,293,7.0,2019-01-06,traction,"On a clean court, you will be sticking nicely, but don't even think about using these on a dusty court."
11935,278,45,9.0,2019-04-06,traction,Multidirectional herringbone. If it's not broke - don't fix it!
11936,278,522,8.0,2019-02-11,traction,Traction is great when clean and fully broken in but still needs wiping on dusty floors.
11937,278,6,9.5,2018-12-17,cushion,It's really crazy how much court-feel and responsiveness you get out of the new Lightstrike cushioning without your feet feeling dead after a long basketball session.
11938,278,176,9.0,2019-01-06,cushion,The Lightstrike cushioning is a good middle ground between the softer Boost technology and the responsive Adidas Bounce.
11939,278,293,9.0,2019-01-06,cushion,"The new Lightstrike cushioning is awesome. Great impact protection, good compression in the heel, thin and responsive in the forefoot."
11940,278,45,9.0,2019-04-06,cushion,"The Lightstrike cushioning took us by storm. It's ridiculously responsive, comfortable and durable."
11941,278,522,9.0,2019-02-11,cushion,The Lightstrike foam is the highlight of the shoe and is very comfortable right out of the box.
11942,278,6,9.0,2018-12-17,materials,The full Primeknit upper feels amazing. The inside is nylon-backed to give you additional stability and support.
11943,278,176,9.5,2019-01-06,materials,The full Primeknit upper is strong and supportive where it needs to be and soft and flexible everywhere else.
11944,278,293,10.0,2019-01-06,materials,The full-on Primeknit is super comfortable on-foot.
11945,278,45,8.0,2019-04-06,materials,"The entire shoe is made from comfortable Primeknit that requires minimal break-in time,"
11946,278,522,8.0,2019-02-11,materials,"It’s comfortable, it’s Primeknitish and it’s stretchy."
11947,278,6,9.0,2018-12-17,support,"There is no heel slippage, no side-to-side movement and a lot of support on lateral cuts."
11948,278,176,7.0,2019-01-06,support,"All in all, for a shoe with no laces, support is surprisingly good."
11949,278,293,8.0,2019-01-06,support,"Even though there are no laces, support was really good. Lateral containment is solid, there is absolutely no heel slippage, and the wide base offers a lot of stability."
11950,278,45,8.0,2019-04-06,support,"The outrigger, internal heel counter, TPU lateral barrier and the lockdown of the upper material provided great support."
11951,278,522,8.0,2019-02-11,support,Stability is very nice with a low to ground cushioning set up and a nice wide outsole.
11952,278,6,9.0,2018-12-17,fit,There are no laces in this shoe but Adidas absolutely killed it! Almost feels like a second skin.
11953,278,176,9.5,2019-01-06,fit,"There are no laces but the fit is fantastic. It takes a bit of twisting and pulling, but once your foot is in, there is no slipping at all."
11954,278,293,8.0,2019-01-06,fit,"In the beginning, it is really hard to get these shoes on, but this gets better over time. There is a little dead space in the toe box that I didn't enjoy, other than that, the fit was great for me."
11955,278,45,8.0,2019-04-06,fit,"The fit starts off extremely tight, but once it breaks in it conforms really nicely to your feet. We feared that the shoe would become too loose after a while, but that wasn't the case. Only downside: this shoe is incredibly hard to put on."
11956,278,522,7.0,2019-02-11,fit,"Heel slip was horrible in the beginning but got a little better over time. Overall, the fit feels great stationary but during play, not so much."
11957,278,293,0.0,2019-01-06,outdoor,The rubber is really soft so I wouldn't recommend this shoe for outdoor use.
11958,278,293,2,2019-01-06,width,This shoe is slightly narrow but materials will stretch out a little over time.
11959,278,45,2,2019-04-06,width,Starts off really tightly.
11960,278,522,3,2019-02-11,width,These fit like a sock with a sole with no dead space at all.
11961,278,293,4,2019-01-06,size,Go true to your Adidas size (1/2 half size down from Nike)
11962,278,45,3,2019-04-06,size,True to size.
11963,278,522,4,2019-02-11,size,"Like most Adidas, I could have gone half a size down if I wanted to."
11964,279,6,8.6,2019-01-06,expert_overall,"This is a pretty fun shoe to play in! If you are a T-Mac fan go for them, but there are better bang-for-the-buck shoes out there."
11965,279,522,8.4,2019-01-06,expert_overall,"I really enjoy playing in this shoe because it does everything well. I especially love the cushioning set up, traction, and as shallow as this sounds, its looks."
11966,279,293,8.4,2019-01-13,expert_overall,"I was super-impressed by the performance of the T-Mac Millenium. Much better than the original T-Mac! This is a very durable shoe, that should work well for big guys who need a lot of support and cushioning."
11967,279,700,10.0,2022-02-18,user_overall,"Fantastic shoe, incredible in every category. Traction almost perfect (incredibly minimal dust pickup), cushion amazing (bouncy, responsive everything you need in a cushion setup), support amazing, fit (very good 1:1 fit), same thing with sizing. Just buy it, believe in me!!!"

11969,279,6,9.0,2019-01-06,traction,"I was pleasantly surprised. Whether I was playing on clean or dusty courts, I didn't have any problems."
11970,279,522,9.0,2019-01-06,traction,These worked great on everything but the dirtiest of floors.
11971,279,293,10.0,2019-01-13,traction,Great stopping power and almost no wiping needed.
11972,279,6,8.5,2019-01-06,cushion,"Thicker Boost in the back for impact protection, thinner Boost in the front for court feel and responsiveness. Overall, this implementation of Boost is a little firmer than I would have liked."
11973,279,522,9.0,2019-01-06,cushion,"As always, Boost feels great with no lag in the forefoot."
11974,279,293,9.0,2019-01-13,cushion,Awesome cushioning! Feels similar to the Marquee Boost.
11975,279,6,8.5,2019-01-06,materials,"In-hand, the materials don't feel very premium and a solid break-in time is required. The synthetic leather materials should be very durable."
11976,279,522,8.0,2019-01-06,materials,"The materials are not soft and flexible out of the box, but they break in nicely."
11977,279,293,7.0,2019-01-13,materials,"The synthetic upper is very strong and doesn't feel great in-hand. In the beginning, it doesn't feel good on-foot but it breaks in nicely and is very supportive."
11978,279,6,9.0,2019-01-06,support,I didn't have any lateral instabilities or heel slip.
11979,279,522,8.0,2019-01-06,support,The T-Mac Millenium provides more ankle support than usual for a low-top. There's also solid midfoot support and a stable and wide base.
11980,279,293,8.0,2019-01-13,support,"I didn't feel super-locked down in the heel, but lateral support and containment are great."
11981,279,6,8.0,2019-01-06,fit,There is a lot of dead space on top of my toes which can be really annoying.
11982,279,522,8.0,2019-01-06,fit,"After a short break-in, the fit is good overall, but I think another layer of padding would have made it feel better."
11983,279,293,8.0,2019-01-13,fit,The fit worked very well for my narrow feet.
11984,279,293,0.0,2019-01-13,outdoor,Probably not the best option for outdoor use.
11985,279,293,2,2019-01-13,width,Slightly narrow.
11986,279,522,4,2019-01-06,size,The standard half a size down we are used to from Adidas.
11987,279,293,4,2019-01-13,size,Go down 1/2 size to your Adidas size.
11988,280,293,8.6,2019-02-01,expert_overall,"For $100 this would have been a really, really solid performer if it hadn't been for the cushion.  Only recommended if you play on clean courts."
11989,280,33,8.2,2019-02-01,expert_overall,"For under $100 retail I can't think of a more versatile shoe. However, I think there are other decently priced sneakers that perform much better."

11991,280,293,7.0,2019-02-01,traction,"Works well on clean courts, but dusty courts are super slippery."
11992,280,33,9.0,2019-02-01,traction,The wider-spaced herringbone traction pattern worked well on clean floors and held up nicely on dusty courts.
11993,280,293,9.0,2019-02-01,cushion,Court feel is really good and the heel is plush - I really enjoyed this setup.
11994,280,33,9.0,2019-02-01,cushion,"The Bounce cushioning rides low in the forefoot and is plusher in the heel. You feel really quick in these shoes, but I prefer a little more comfort and impact protection."
11995,280,293,8.0,2019-02-01,materials,"The quality of the materials feels really cheap, but on-foot it's nice."
11996,280,33,7.0,2019-02-01,materials,The mix of mesh and felt materials doesn't feel great but it gets the job done.
11997,280,293,10.0,2019-02-01,support,Support and lockdown are A+!
11998,280,33,9.0,2019-02-01,support,"A huge outrigger, a midsole that cups your foot and strong overlays placed for lateral containment provided great support."
11999,280,293,9.0,2019-02-01,fit,The slightly narrow and tight fit worked really well for me and I also liked how easy it is to slip into these.
12000,280,33,7.0,2019-02-01,fit,The lacing system is a little bit of a nuisance and needs constant adjusting to stay tight.
12001,280,293,50.0,2019-02-01,outdoor,The rubber is soft but really thick so outdoor use should be okay.
12002,281,649,9.3,2018-12-14,expert_overall,"Simply put, the Kyrie 5 is a fantastic shoe for the money, and would be a fantastic shoe at any price."
12003,281,32,9.0,2018-11-19,expert_overall,I really like the Nike Zoom Air Turbo and the Flytrap shroud. The Kyrie 5 is an upgrade over the Kyrie 4 and works best for quick players who prefer court feel over soft cushioning.
12004,281,293,8.8,2018-12-03,expert_overall,"I love these! If you liked the Kyrie 2 or 4, then you are going to love the Kyrie 5."
12005,281,33,8.8,2018-12-04,expert_overall,"The Nike Kyrie 5 offers plenty of court feel, a little bit of cushion, great lockdown and aggressive traction wrapped up in a lightweight package."
12006,281,86,8.7,2019-01-06,expert_overall,The Kyrie 5 is a fun shoe that caters to the needs of those that play a more grounded game and require unrestricted mobility.
12007,281,522,8.3,2018-12-14,expert_overall,"This is a very good shoe that does everything well with great traction, fit, and decent cushioning."
12008,281,701,8.2,2019-02-23,expert_overall,"The Kyrie 5 is a very solid shoe. The main pros are lockdown and court feel, cons are the cushioning of the outsole and the lacking padding of the inner material."
12009,281,45,7.6,2019-01-06,expert_overall,"The Kyrie 5 is a solid shoe. The support and cushioning are great, but the traction is disappointing."
12010,281,221,7.6,2019-02-11,expert_overall,The Kyrie 5 probably won't find its way back into my gym bag any time soon - the traction was just too bad in my pair.
12011,281,702,9.4,2022-02-10,user_overall,"This shoe has been my only pair of indoor basketball shoes and have never failed me once. Traction is great, very durable and relatively clean with just the wipe of the hand. Only thing is the breathability in it, but I don't really care about that too much."
12012,281,568,8.6,2025-03-19,user_overall,"en canchas sucias se resbala bastante, pero solo es limpiar otra vez la suela y se llena de polvo, la amortiguación siento que falta algo para que sea completo, el fit recomiendo subirlo media talla si tienes pie ancho, agarra muy bien el tobillo."
12013,281,527,9.0,2022-11-25,user_overall,"A great shoe with a low to ground feel and play. The only thing is I sometimes rip my achilles on the heel. Above ankle socks aren't even safe, gotta go crew."
12014,281,604,8.6,2024-04-10,user_overall,"Pretty good shoe for point guards , you’ll ,it’s a good shoe if your a ankle snatcher but I advice kyrie 6 is much better"

12016,281,649,9.0,2018-12-14,traction,"Like any sneaker, you’ll need to swipe now and then for maximum grip, but the traction is excellent right out of the box!"
12017,281,32,8.0,2018-11-19,traction,"The traction is hit and miss. In the beginning it is really slippery on dusty courts, but it gets better after breaking it in. On clean courts, the traction is great."
12018,281,293,9.0,2018-12-03,traction,"The traction bites really hard on clean courts. On dusty courts, it' a little more inconsistent."
12019,281,33,9.5,2018-12-04,traction,"The traction works well, even on the worst courts."
12020,281,86,9.5,2019-01-06,traction,The traction was exceptional.
12021,281,522,8.0,2018-12-14,traction,Works great on clean floors but needs ocassional wiping on dusty courts.
12022,281,701,8.0,2019-02-23,traction,"The traction is still very good, but it's a step back from the Kyrie 4."
12023,281,45,7.0,2019-01-06,traction,"For a Kyrie model, the traction is a little disappointing. Picks up a lot of dust and performance is very inconsistent."
12024,281,221,6.0,2019-02-11,traction,"Straight out of the box, the traction was awful. After the break-in, on some days the traction was solid, other days it was terrible. Overall, the experience was very inconsistent."
12025,281,649,10.0,2018-12-14,cushion,"The Air Zoom Turbo bag is truly outstanding, and responsive from any angle. This may very well be my new favorite cushioning from Nike."
12026,281,32,8.0,2018-11-19,cushion,"The cushioning feels very similar to the Kyrie 4. Very low-to-the-ground, responsive with great heel-to-toe-transition."
12027,281,293,8.0,2018-12-03,cushion,"Solid impact protection, nice heel-to-toe transition, and bouncy feel of the Nike Zoom Air in the forefoot. Overall, the setup is rather stiff and responsive like we are used to from Kyrie signature models."
12028,281,33,7.0,2018-12-04,cushion,"The new Zoom Air Turbo gives a nice minimal under-foot feel while offering a fast, fluid and agile ride."
12029,281,86,7.0,2019-01-06,cushion,"The shoe is designed for maximum court-feel; the cushion isn’t overly bouncy, it does its job."
12030,281,522,8.0,2018-12-14,cushion,The new Noom Turbo is technically improved but I still prefer the softer Zoom of the Kyrie 4.
12031,281,701,8.0,2019-02-23,cushion,"The cushioning is not great, but it gets the job done. Court feel is great though."
12032,281,45,8.0,2019-01-06,cushion,Forefoot Nike Zoom Turbo sounds like a gimmick but works really well.
12033,281,221,8.0,2019-02-11,cushion,The Air Zoom Turbo is a more low-profile version of Nike Zoom Air and provides a lot of court feel and explosiveness.
12034,281,32,8.0,2018-11-19,materials,The engineered mesh feels really nice and needs very little break-in time.
12035,281,293,8.0,2018-12-03,materials,The materials don't feel premium in-hand but they get the job done!
12036,281,33,9.0,2018-12-04,materials,The engineered mesh takes a little to break-in but gets the job done.
12037,281,86,9.0,2019-01-06,materials,"The engineered Mesh is nice, lightweight and breaks-in rather quickly"
12038,281,701,7.0,2019-02-23,materials,I would have loved more padding inside the shoe.
12039,281,45,7.0,2019-01-06,materials,"The engineered mesh is supportive, durable, breathable but also pretty stiff."
12040,281,221,7.0,2019-02-11,materials,"The materials are pretty much 100% mesh. They get the job done, but there are better options out there."
12041,281,649,9.0,2018-12-14,support,The overall fit and lockdown are so good that the heel has nowhere to move and the collar-padding eliminates any slipping or sliding.
12042,281,32,9.0,2018-11-19,support,I like the lockdown provided by the Flytrap shroud and the stability of the less-rounded outsole.
12043,281,293,10.0,2018-12-03,support,"Really good ankle support, very wide base and great lateral containment."
12044,281,33,9.0,2018-12-04,support,The support is solid - I have no complaints.
12045,281,86,9.0,2019-01-06,support,The shoe keeps you secure on the footbed and fully locked-in.
12046,281,522,8.0,2018-12-14,support,Fairly high and stiff ankle collar and firm heel counter provide good support.
12047,281,701,9.0,2019-02-23,support,"No slippage, no internal movement, absolutely no dead space. I felt securely locked in at all times."
12048,281,45,9.0,2019-01-06,support,This is probably the most supportive guard shoe currently on the market.
12049,281,221,9.0,2019-02-11,support,Support is very similar to previous Kyrie models.
12050,281,649,9.0,2018-12-14,fit,"The Kyrie 5 is really hard to get on but once the shoe is laced up, the experience is hard to beat."
12051,281,32,8.0,2018-11-19,fit,"A little difficult to get on, but the comfort and fit were absolutely solid for me."
12052,281,293,9.0,2018-12-03,fit,I love the fit of the Kyrie 5.
12053,281,33,9.5,2018-12-04,fit,Top of my foot felt snug and secure but not restrictive.
12054,281,86,9.0,2019-01-06,fit,This is probably one of the best locked down shoes to date.
12055,281,522,9.0,2018-12-14,fit,The Kyrie 5 fits great out of the box with no heel slip or side to side movement.
12056,281,701,9.0,2019-02-23,fit,"The fit is really snug, but if I wear thin socks, these fit nicely."
12057,281,45,7.0,2019-01-06,fit,The fit is good for narrow feet but I struggled mightily with my wider feet.
12058,281,221,8.0,2019-02-11,fit,The fit provided a snug 1:1 experience but could have been a little more comfortable for me.
12059,281,293,50.0,2018-12-03,outdoor,The rubber grooves are super deep and pretty durable.
12060,281,45,0.0,2019-01-06,outdoor,I wouldn't recommend outdoor use because the rubber compound is extremely soft.
12061,281,293,2,2018-12-03,width,"A little tight at first, but the materials stretch out over time."
12062,281,522,1,2018-12-14,width,"As a wide footer, I went up half a size to 11.5 and they fit me perfectly."
12063,281,701,2,2019-02-23,width,The fit is very snug.
12064,281,45,1,2019-01-06,width,The Kyrie 5 fits extremely snug.
12065,281,293,3,2018-12-03,size,Go true to size.
12066,281,522,3,2018-12-14,size,True to size fit but Kyries are not that fat feet friendly.
12067,281,701,3,2019-02-23,size,Run true to size.
12068,282,33,8.7,2018-10-11,expert_overall,The Puma Clyde Court Disrupt wound up being one of the more fun models to play in this year (so far).   Not in the Top 5 discussion but you receive solid performance and cushion for the price.
12069,282,701,8.7,2018-10-30,expert_overall,The Puma Clyde Court Disrupt is a very vibrant and well-rounded sneaker. I really like them and I am pleasantly surprised by their performance.
12070,282,615,8.5,2018-10-20,expert_overall,Overall the Puma Clyde Court is a really fun shoe to play in. Great job by Puma!
12071,282,221,8.4,2018-12-14,expert_overall,"It's really impressive what Puma was able to do in their first basketball sneaker in a long time. The materials and fit are absolutely A1, the support and traction, however,  could use a little tweaking."
12072,282,293,8.2,2018-11-19,expert_overall,The performance is middle of the road. They won't stay in my rotation but they might work well as a big-man shoe or as an outdoor shoe.
12073,282,32,8.0,2018-10-08,expert_overall,"I am very impressed by the first hoops shoe by Puma after their comeback to basketball. The cushioning and traction could be a little better, but everything else was great!"
12074,282,649,8.0,2018-10-30,expert_overall,The Puma Clyde Court Disrupt is a great first impression for Puma's relaunched basketball division.
12075,282,45,7.2,2019-01-06,expert_overall,Welcome back Puma! This is a strong shoe that is only let down by the lacking ankle support and bad traction on dusty courts.
12076,282,703,8.0,2022-03-14,user_overall,"These shoes look and feel amazing. The materials soft and premium, unlike anything else for the price. On foot, the cushion setup did not feel very soft or bouncy but it was very responsive. On clean courts, after some break in time, the traction was good. They did, however, pick up dust rather quickly so I had to wipe them a lot. After about a year of playing in them the outsole was only minimally fraying around the heel and forefoot."
12077,282,470,8.4,2021-10-25,user_overall,"The Puma Clyde Court Disrupt was actually WAY better than I thought it would be by having tolerable traction and cushion, really comfortable and durable material, and good fit overall. In the end, I recommend this shoe for hoopers of any play style."
12078,282,704,8.6,2022-04-08,user_overall,
12079,282,33,9.0,2018-10-11,traction,The outsole gripped most of the courts I played on really well.
12080,282,701,8.0,2018-10-30,traction,"The traction allowed me to move, cut and defend well."
12081,282,615,8.0,2018-10-20,traction,"The traction was super solid on clean courts, but on dusty courts, you will need to wipe a bit more than you would want to."
12082,282,221,7.0,2018-12-14,traction,"Traction is very inconsistent, be prepared to wipe a lot."
12083,282,293,8.0,2018-11-19,traction,"On dusty courts, you will need to wipe a lot, other than that, traction is pretty good."
12084,282,32,8.0,2018-10-08,traction,The traction takes a while to break in but then it's solid.
12085,282,649,9.0,2018-10-30,traction,I found the traction to be a strong point.
12086,282,45,6.0,2019-01-06,traction,The throwback design of the outsole looks nice but didn't get the job done on dusty courts. I had to wipe every time I transitioned from defense to offense.
12087,282,33,9.0,2018-10-11,cushion,A ton of impact protection with good court feel. I would have liked a little more feedback.
12088,282,701,9.0,2018-10-30,cushion,"Very responsive and bouncy feel, but a lot less court feel than other shoes. The heel-to-toe transition is surprisingly good."
12089,282,615,9.0,2018-10-20,cushion,The cushioning reminded me of Adidas Bounce technology with a little less responsiveness and court feel. The impact protection is outstanding.
12090,282,221,8.0,2018-12-14,cushion,I was not expecting so much court feel from this cushioning setup. I would have loved a little more bounce-back.
12091,282,293,6.0,2018-11-19,cushion,"The foam in the cushioning is caged by a super thick rubber which leads to a clunky heel-to-toe transition. Impact protection is decent, but the court feel is not great because you are very high-off-the-ground."
12092,282,32,8.0,2018-10-08,cushion,"I liked the cushioning a lot! Feels like something in-between Adidas Boost and Adidas Bounce cushioning with a nice mixture of responsiveness and comfort. Unfortunately, it started bottoming out quickly."
12093,282,649,7.0,2018-10-30,cushion,"The cushioning doesn’t feel fast, dynamic, or responsive at game speed. On the bright side - the court feel is top-notch!"
12094,282,45,8.0,2019-01-06,cushion,"The cushioning was very comfortable and plush, I would have liked a little more court feel though."
12095,282,33,9.5,2018-10-11,materials,"I enjoyed the good-looking, durable, and supportive knit upper."
12096,282,615,9.0,2018-10-20,materials,"The sock-like knit upper is comfortable, durable and flexible."
12097,282,221,9.0,2018-12-14,materials,The stretchy upper materials are very comfortable.
12098,282,293,9.0,2018-11-19,materials,Materials look premium and feel comfortable on-foot.
12099,282,32,9.0,2018-10-08,materials,"The materials are soft, flexible and durable."
12100,282,45,8.0,2019-01-06,materials,The knit upper is flexible and supportive and I like the retro hints of leather.
12101,282,33,9.0,2018-10-11,support,"The heel counter and lacing system worked well and the tooling is firm, flat, and extremely stable."
12102,282,701,9.0,2018-10-30,support,The support was surprisingly good considering the knit upper. Lockdown was great too.
12103,282,615,8.0,2018-10-20,support,"Support was solid because of the wide base, heel counter and, the supportive rubber in the midsole."
12104,282,221,8.0,2018-12-14,support,Puma sacrificed some support in exchange for comfort which will probably not work for some more explosive players.
12105,282,293,9.0,2018-11-19,support,Support and lockdown are great!
12106,282,32,9.0,2018-10-08,support,The perfect combination of support and flexibility.
12107,282,649,8.0,2018-10-30,support,My foot was held securely over the footbed for a confident ride.
12108,282,45,6.0,2019-01-06,support,This shoe is best worn with an ankle brace.
12109,282,33,7.0,2018-10-11,fit,"Lockdown was a pleasant surprise, but I would have preferred the forefoot to be a little more snug."
12110,282,221,10.0,2018-12-14,fit,The shoe snapped to my feet perfectly.
12111,282,293,9.0,2018-11-19,fit,The fit was pretty damn good with no dead space in the toe box.
12112,282,649,8.0,2018-10-30,fit,Easier to slide-on and more customizable than most sock-based upper designs.
12113,282,45,8.0,2019-01-06,fit,The sock-like design is easy to get in and very comfortable for the get-go.
12114,282,293,100.0,2018-11-19,outdoor,"The rubber is really hard, so the outdoor use should be good."
12115,282,293,4,2018-11-19,width,Normal to a touch wide.
12116,282,45,4,2019-01-06,width,This shoe caters very well to wide-footers.
12117,282,701,3,2018-10-30,size,The fit is true-to-size.
12118,282,293,4,2018-11-19,size,The fit is a little bit long.
12119,282,45,3,2019-01-06,size,"Go down half a size if you have narrow feet, stay true to size with wide or regular feet."
12120,283,33,9.1,2018-10-16,expert_overall,The traction and cushion are very solid but the FastFit lacing system has room for improvement and may throw some people off.
12121,283,293,9.0,2018-10-08,expert_overall,We love the new FastFit lacing system. The Air Jordan 33 will definitely be in my rotation even though it is a bit heavy and clunky.
12122,283,176,8.8,2019-01-06,expert_overall,"The Air Jordan 33 is a great shoe, especially for big guys looking for impact protection and support. Quick guards looking for a light and minimal shoe should look elsewhere."
12123,283,6,8.8,2019-05-08,expert_overall,"Even at the hefty price of $175, I really enjoyed playing in these. The AIr Jordan 33 is a great performer that really stands out on the court thanks to the fast-fit lacing system."
12124,283,221,8.3,2019-01-13,expert_overall,"I can't recommend the Air Jordan 33 because they never really broke in for me. The midsole remained extremely stiff and uncomfortable, even after 30 hours of 5 vs 5 play."
12125,283,522,8.0,2019-02-11,expert_overall,"Overall, the Air Jordan 33 is a good shoe if you love the looks and the innovative sneaker tech. It performs well in almost every aspect but I think $175 is too expensive for what you get. $130 would be a much fairer retail price."
12126,283,45,7.2,2018-11-08,expert_overall,"The Fast Fit system is no gimmick, the support is great, but the materials are a letdown - there are just too many!"
12127,283,32,7.0,2018-10-30,expert_overall,"I am very disappointed in the Air Jordan 33. The traction is inconsistent, the materials are subpar and the comfort is a disaster!"
12128,283,495,8.6,2022-01-10,user_overall,
12129,283,33,9.0,2018-10-16,traction,The Air Jordan 33 bit the floor nicely and loud as hell.
12130,283,293,9.0,2018-10-08,traction,The traction was amazing on lateral movements but slightly slippery on linear movements.
12131,283,176,9.0,2019-01-06,traction,Works well on clean courts but dusty courts are problematic.
12132,283,6,9.0,2019-05-08,traction,Super loud and one of the best traction patterns I've experienced in any Jordan model.
12133,283,221,9.0,2019-01-13,traction,"The traction is snappy, responsive, and works reliably -  even on dusty courts."
12134,283,522,8.0,2019-02-11,traction,"The micro tread pattern does well, especially when clean or freshly wiped."
12135,283,45,7.0,2018-11-08,traction,Traction was inconsistent on dusty courts.
12136,283,32,7.0,2018-10-30,traction,"Loud, squeaking traction that does a good job on lateral moves, but I slipped a lot going in straight lines or planting for jumps."
12137,283,33,9.0,2018-10-16,cushion,The Hex Zoom in the heel and unlocked Zoom Air in the forefoot take a little to break-in but provide a nice little extra spring to your step.
12138,283,293,8.0,2018-10-08,cushion,"Court feel is okay, impact protection is pretty good, and there is a lot of responsiveness."
12139,283,176,9.0,2019-01-06,cushion,The great big slab of Zoom Air in the forefoot and the hex unit in the heel provide perfect impact protection once the firm Phylon carrier is broken in.
12140,283,6,8.0,2019-05-08,cushion,After breaking in the midsole you get a really nice response from the unlocked Zoom bag in the forefoot. The heel is a little dead and overall the setup feels a bit clunky.
12141,283,221,9.0,2019-01-13,cushion,The forefoot unlocked Zoom Air is bouncy and explosive.
12142,283,522,9.0,2019-02-11,cushion,If you can't feel the very large forefoot zoom you should get your nerve endings checked!
12143,283,45,7.0,2018-11-08,cushion,"The big Zoom unit in the front is great, but the heel-to-toe transition is very clunky."
12144,283,32,8.0,2018-10-30,cushion,The Zoom Units are responsive but the outsole is crazy stiff and takes forever to break-in.
12145,283,33,9.0,2018-10-16,materials,"Unlike the Air Jordan 32, the textile here is much lighter, thinner, and more breathable."
12146,283,293,9.0,2018-10-08,materials,"The materials are very thin, soft and pliable."
12147,283,176,7.0,2019-01-06,materials,The mesh/fuse construction doesn't provide the premium look and feel we're used to from Air Jordan but the materials get the job done.
12148,283,6,9.0,2019-05-08,materials,"The materials feel really premium, look good, and perform well!"
12149,283,221,8.0,2019-01-13,materials,"The materials get the job done, but for $185, I would have liked more premium materials."
12150,283,522,7.0,2019-02-11,materials,"Nothing to see here but Mesh. If you’re big on value and how luxurious a shoe feels, look elsewhere."
12151,283,45,6.0,2018-11-08,materials,"Every material on their own is fine, but there is just too much going on which leads to unnecessary weight and a clunky feel."
12152,283,32,8.0,2018-10-30,materials,The materials aren't very premium and they don't feel the best.
12153,283,33,9.5,2018-10-16,support,"Despite being laceless, the Air Jordan 33 easily keeps you on the footbed and locks your heel down tightly. The midfoot torsion support is a bit much in the beginning but breaks-in nicely."
12154,283,293,10.0,2018-10-08,support,Amazing lockdown and great stability.
12155,283,176,9.5,2019-01-06,support,"The Jordan XXXIII is easily the most supportive, structured shoe on the market today from a major brand."
12156,283,6,9.0,2019-05-08,support,"I never had any heel slippage or side-to-side movement. Lateral movements are no problem either, thanks to the wide and stable base."
12157,283,522,8.0,2019-02-11,support,The hidden speed plate provides very good midfoot support and the flat and somewhat wide outsole provides you with a lot of stability.
12158,283,45,8.0,2018-11-08,support,Makes you feel locked-in and locked down!
12159,283,32,8.0,2018-10-30,support,"The FastFit lacing system provides great lockdown, but I would have still preferred a more customizable traditional lacing system."
12160,283,33,9.0,2018-10-16,fit,The standout of the Air Jordan 33 is the FastFit lacing system: Does it work? Yes. It actually does. Is it perfect? No.
12161,283,293,9.0,2018-10-08,fit,Super snug fit with very little dead space. The Fast Fit lacing system works like a charm and gives you crazy lockdown.
12162,283,176,9.5,2019-01-06,fit,The lockdown is complete and total – you will have NO heel slip or lateral movement.
12163,283,6,9.0,2019-05-08,fit,The fast-fit lacing system is awesome and provides great fit.
12164,283,221,7.0,2019-01-13,fit,"The new lacing system works fine and provided good lockdown around the fore- and midfoot, but the ankle collar was a little too loose for my liking. The stiff midsole never really broke-in and was very uncomfortable during longer playing sessions."
12165,283,522,8.0,2019-02-11,fit,I had no issues side to side or front to back because the lacing system just works.
12166,283,45,8.0,2018-11-08,fit,The Fast Fit laceless lacing system works well and the half-boot construction feels great.
12167,283,32,6.0,2018-10-30,fit,The shoe is really snug at first and it takes a little while to get used to the fit. Not very comfortable overall.
12168,283,293,100.0,2018-10-08,outdoor,Very hard rubber and deep grooves - should be okay outdoors.
12169,283,45,0.0,2018-11-08,outdoor,Big fat no because of the translucent rubber.
12170,283,293,2,2018-10-08,width,Runs a tad bit narrow.
12171,283,293,4,2018-10-08,size,Go down half a size unless you have very wide feet.
12172,283,6,3,2019-05-08,size,Go true to size.
12173,283,522,4,2019-02-11,size,Regular and narrow footers can go down half a size depending on their preferences.
12174,284,293,10.0,2018-10-18,expert_overall,This is the best performer of 2018. I am going to get five pairs of these!
12175,284,33,9.4,2018-11-19,expert_overall,The performance of the Adidas Harden Volume 3 on the court is nearly perfect. It's a special shoe in that it's so simple that it does everything right!
12176,284,176,9.1,2018-10-30,expert_overall,"This is the best Harden we have seen so far. Works for players at any position who enjoy freedom of movement, court feel with above-average impact protection, and a great fit."
12177,284,32,9.0,2018-10-30,expert_overall,This is by far the best shoe in the Harden signature series. Pretty much everything was improved - I especially like the cushioning and materials.
12178,284,6,9.0,2018-10-30,expert_overall,Definitely an upgrade over the Harden 2. This shoe has pretty much everything I want in a performance sneaker!
12179,284,649,8.8,2018-11-19,expert_overall,The Harden 3 is a standout when it comes to performance! It checks all the boxes for comfort and fit and does so at a relatively affordable $140 price point.
12180,284,522,8.6,2018-10-30,expert_overall,"Great traction, pretty good fit and fun Boost cushioning - sign me up! I’m going to give this a first-team rating."
12181,284,45,8.0,2019-01-06,expert_overall,"Fit and cushion are awesome, but the traction was a little too inconsistent and the support a little too low."
12182,284,358,9.8,2021-12-31,user_overall,"Best shoe I've had, even after years of hard wear and play. Cushion is super sweet, has a nice balanced feel that makes you feel quick and snappy. The grip is mint, support is excellent and the materials are nice as well. The perfect example of not doing too much with a shoe yet still reaping the performance benefits. One of the all time greatest Adidas hoop shoes, Hardens haven't been this good since. A shoe everyone can enjoy no matter your dimensions or athletic abilities."
12183,284,552,8.8,2021-11-06,user_overall,"This shoes proves that basketball shoes was never about smashing the best material together, you just need everything to be spot on. My only real problem with this shoe is that although it obviously feature boost, it doesnt provide the soft feel that I prefer, instead it provide decent court feel, even though I personally dont prefer it, for those who prefer court feel this one should do it."
12184,284,705,9.1,2023-04-09,user_overall,I've been playing on these for about 3 years and it's still holding up pretty good. On dusty courts this are still very squeaky but you will a lil slipping but on a clean court it's very good
12185,284,222,8.8,2023-09-16,user_overall,"One of the best traction shoes I’ve ever had. Almost a perfect performer in general, especially for point guards. Just watch out for the impact protection."
12186,284,706,9.6,2022-04-15,user_overall,"Really amazing sneakers!  best basketball shoes I have, better than newer models! durability, traction, cushioning... perfect for all courts."
12187,284,293,10.0,2018-10-18,traction,The herringbone traction is insane! Dust is only a very minimal problem.
12188,284,33,9.0,2018-11-19,traction,"On clean courts, the traction was nothing short of awesome. On dusty courts, you will need to wipe occasionally."
12189,284,176,9.0,2018-10-30,traction,The traditional herringbone pattern worked well on all courts I played on.
12190,284,32,9.0,2018-10-30,traction,Superb traction!
12191,284,6,9.0,2018-10-30,traction,The traction is freaking amazing!
12192,284,649,8.0,2018-11-19,traction,"When the sole is clean, grip is fantastic, but it has a tendency to pick up dust fast."
12193,284,522,9.0,2018-10-30,traction,Adidas went with traditional herringbone set up and it’s easily the best traction on a Harden yet.
12194,284,45,7.0,2019-01-06,traction,The translucent rubber on our colorway didn't pick up too much dust on our dirty courts and got the job done. There were some inconsistencies that prevented a better score.
12195,284,293,10.0,2018-10-18,cushion,The Boost cushioning isn't caged as much as in the previous Harden models. It provides great impact protection while still being responsive. This is my favorite cushioning setups!
12196,284,33,9.5,2018-11-19,cushion,It’s not too bouncy. It’s not too firm. It’s just right - this is my favorite version of Boost in basketball.
12197,284,176,9.5,2018-10-30,cushion,The Boost cushioning is less pronounced than in the Harden Vol. 2 but provides a better balance between court feel and impact protection.
12198,284,32,10.0,2018-10-30,cushion,"Good court feel, good impact protection and the Boost cushioning feels amazing!"
12199,284,6,9.0,2018-10-30,cushion,Good amount of bounce in the heel and more responsiveness in the front. I really enjoy the Boost cushioning!
12200,284,649,9.0,2018-11-19,cushion,This is the best use of the Boost foam yet when it comes to basketball.
12201,284,522,9.0,2018-10-30,cushion,"The cushioning provides a nice balance of comfort, court feel, springiness, and fun."
12202,284,45,10.0,2019-01-06,cushion,The Boost cushioning is a little lower than in the Harden Vol.2 which makes the shoe lighter and gives you better court feel. Impact protection is still there.
12203,284,293,10.0,2018-10-18,materials,"The materials are very soft, look and feel premium and provide great lockdown and stability."
12204,284,33,9.5,2018-11-19,materials,The thick and strong materials feel great on-foot.
12205,284,176,9.0,2018-10-30,materials,The textile upper with synthetic overlay is comfortable and pliable out of the box.
12206,284,32,9.0,2018-10-30,materials,The materials are very lightweight and feel great. Very soft and flexible!
12207,284,6,9.0,2018-10-30,materials,The materials feel really nice and do a great job. The shoe gets really hot after playing a while.
12208,284,522,8.0,2018-10-30,materials,"Basic ""textile"" materials that feel somewhat premium."
12209,284,45,8.0,2019-01-06,materials,The materials are super comfortable but stretch out a little too easily.
12210,284,293,10.0,2018-10-18,support,"Lateral containment is very good, the materials are supportive and the base is pretty wide and stable."
12211,284,33,9.0,2018-11-19,support,The support works perfectly well.
12212,284,176,9.0,2018-10-30,support,"The materials do a fantastic job with lockdown, the caging of the Boost provides stability and acts as an outrigger and the fantastic fit does the rest."
12213,284,32,9.0,2018-10-30,support,Much more stable than previous Harden models.
12214,284,6,9.0,2018-10-30,support,"Nice lateral containment, stable base and the heel slippage went away after the break-in period."
12215,284,649,9.0,2018-11-19,support,"The cut, combined with perfectly molded collar padding, held my heel in place exceptionally well, providing optimal ankle stability."
12216,284,522,9.0,2018-10-30,support,"Excellent stability, great midfoot support, and good containment."
12217,284,45,6.0,2019-01-06,support,There was too much freedom of movement in the ankle for my liking.
12218,284,293,10.0,2018-10-18,fit,The fit was very nice for my feet with no dead space at all!
12219,284,33,10.0,2018-11-19,fit,These have been the best fitting Adidas shoes I’ve worn in quite some time.
12220,284,176,9.0,2018-10-30,fit,The lacing system lets you adjust the fit however you like it.
12221,284,32,9.0,2018-10-30,fit,Comfy as hell!
12222,284,6,9.0,2018-10-30,fit,The fit is really comfortable.
12223,284,649,9.0,2018-11-19,fit,There’s something very satisfying about the way the shoe cinches around the foot.
12224,284,522,8.0,2018-10-30,fit,No side to side movement and some very very minor heel slip
12225,284,45,9.0,2019-01-06,fit,The fit works perfectly fine for all type of feet.
12226,284,293,0.0,2018-10-18,outdoor,The rubber is pretty soft. You better stay away from outdoor use.
12227,284,6,3,2018-10-30,width,I am a slightly wide footer and the fit is perfectly nice for me.
12228,284,45,3,2019-01-06,width,The Harden Vol.3 adapts perfectly to your feet.
12229,284,6,4,2018-10-30,size,Go down half a size.
12230,284,522,4,2018-10-30,size,I recommend going down half a size.
12231,285,33,9.2,2018-10-30,expert_overall,The Anta KT4 is a ton of fun to play in. You’ve got to try them for yourself.
12232,285,2,8.8,2021-05-07,expert_overall,"Overall, the Anta KT4 is one of the best performing sneakers available. The cushion is both bouncy and responsive. The traction is awesome, and it has all the support you need."
12233,285,293,8.6,2018-10-30,expert_overall,For $125 you get premium materials and modern tech. I enjoyed playing in these a lot! The only issues are the slightly mushy cushioning and the problematic containment on lateral cuts.
12234,285,33,9.5,2018-10-30,traction,The KT4 uses the same fingerprint traction pattern used in the KT3 and it works incredibly well.
12235,285,2,10.0,2021-05-07,traction,The KT4 has one of the best tractions available on the market. It grips insanely and performed amazingly.
12236,285,293,9.0,2018-10-30,traction,"The traction pattern bites super hard and stops on a dime. On dirty courts, it collects dust easily and it's not easy to wipe."
12237,285,33,9.5,2018-10-30,cushion,The foam cushioning used is very similar to Boost and is very bouncy/springy in the rear while the front offered solid court feel with impact protection.
12238,285,2,9.0,2021-05-07,cushion,The cushion is awesome. Bouncy in the forefoot and plenty of impact protection in the heel. It is one of the best cushion setups available.
12239,285,293,8.0,2018-10-30,cushion,The cushioning is super soft - almost too soft. Impact protection is crazy good but it feels a bit mushy and I didn't like the high offset of the heel.
12240,285,33,9.0,2018-10-30,materials,The upper material looks similar to the Battleknit used in the Lebron 15 but offers more lockdown and is less stretchy.
12241,285,2,8.0,2021-05-07,materials,"This colorway (East Bay Times) specifically was a good performer since it had synthetic leather, but I was not a fan of the mesh uppers for performance."
12242,285,293,10.0,2018-10-30,materials,The materials are very soft and feel super premium.
12243,285,33,9.0,2018-10-30,support,"Extended outrigger, heel counter, and midfoot shank provide ample support."
12244,285,2,9.0,2021-05-07,support,The TPU counter on the lateral side of the shoe offers amazing lateral support and stability to help with side steps and quick stops when planting your foot.
12245,285,293,8.0,2018-10-30,support,There is a little bit of sliding on lateral cuts and the ankle support is pretty minimal.
12246,285,33,9.0,2018-10-30,fit,The lockdown of the upper is surprisingly good.
12247,285,2,8.0,2021-05-07,fit,I found my pair with the synthetic leather upper to have better lockdown than my mesh upper pair.
12248,285,293,8.0,2018-10-30,fit,The knitted upper material started off a little snug but now it's almost too loose.
12249,285,2,50.0,2021-05-07,outdoor,It should be ok for occasional outdoor use.
12250,285,293,0.0,2018-10-30,outdoor,"The rubber is pretty soft and pliable, I am not sure about outdoor use."
12251,285,2,3,2021-05-07,width,"If you have wide feet, you should go true to size."
12252,285,293,3,2018-10-30,width,There is a little dead space in the toe box and the knitted upper is pretty soft and adapts to your feet.
12253,285,2,4,2021-05-07,size,I would suggest half a size down for regular footers.
12254,285,293,4,2018-10-30,size,I went down half a size because the knit stretches out with time.
12255,286,33,9.4,2018-10-04,expert_overall,"The LeBron 16 will suit any play style or move — be it slashing, cutting, shooters, defense, rebounding."
12256,286,293,9.3,2018-10-02,expert_overall,"I really, really like the Lebron 16. The price is expensive but justified by the amazing tech and ultra-premium feel."
12257,286,32,9.0,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"The Lebron 16 is an upgrade in every aspect! They look better, they feel better, and they perform better!"
12258,286,6,9.0,2018-10-01,expert_overall,The Lebron 16 is an outstanding performer!
12259,286,522,8.8,2018-10-01,expert_overall,"Everything I didn't like about the Lebron 15 was fixed! Better traction, better stability, and containment. This is the best Lebron to come out in years!"
12260,286,221,8.8,2018-10-01,expert_overall,"The cushioning setup is super fun to play in, the traction worked on every court and the Battleknit 2.0 is super comfortable. The Lebron 16 is a very versatile shoe, but explosive and fast wing players will particularly love this hoops shoe."
12261,286,701,8.8,2018-10-18,expert_overall,"Awesone impact protection, really good traction, but the court feel is minimal and the Lebron 16 is pretty heavy."
12262,286,45,8.0,2019-01-06,expert_overall,Cushioning and traction are awesome but the fit and support were a bit of a letdown for me.
12263,286,396,8.6,2021-11-09,user_overall,"My first Lebron shoes, bought them for outdoor use. First impression - horrific court feel, boots-like. High ride, gotta get used to it. Incredible cushioning setup for outdoor use - the impact protection is godly and the bounciness is enjoyable. Nice lateral stability. Gorgeous looking, premium feeling. Cons - excessive cushioning for indoor play (I'm >100kg). my right toenail became arch enemies with those shoes, I have to tape it heavily otherwise it gets black after one training (pressure)"
12264,286,358,9.8,2021-12-31,user_overall,"This shoe is nuts. Initially very stiff, the cushioning breaks in after a while and feels like an air mattress beneath your feet. Supreme bounce without sacrificing mobility and court feel, this cushion is best utilised by larger, powerful humans like Bron himself. Traction is epic, nice thick grooves do the job at the highest level. Battleknit is super flexible and my foot feels like it can breath in it. The perfect shoe for a big, explosive athlete like the man this shoe was made for."
12265,286,689,8.0,2021-11-04,user_overall,"Pretty okay pair of shoes. I primarily use these for inside basketball, but they hold up well outside too. If i'm being honest, i expected more for the expensive price. The shoes really aren't anything special, and do not provide a very ""premium"" feel. Accounting for price or not, I'd choose Dame 5's over these any day of the week. For outside and"
12266,286,580,9.0,2021-11-06,user_overall,"This review is for outdoor use only. Using these outdoors was great. They are some of the most comfortable shoes I've worn. The materials were phenomenal. The traction was good for the outdoors. Unfortunately, they did not last long. They lasted about 3-4 months before one of the air max things popped. For Lebrons, they weren't very heavy."
12267,286,707,9.6,2022-05-21,user_overall,"Overall, this shoe surprised me about how good it is. Traction bites hard, even on dusty courts. I have nothing to say about cushioning except for amazing, but its heavy. However, there's one thing I don't like in this shoe is support, I rolled a few times my ankle when I was running, but it rarely happens."
12268,286,33,10.0,2018-10-04,traction,"The Lebron 16 features gripping, thick traction that needs no wiping, and no breaking in."
12269,286,293,8.5,2018-10-02,traction,Not amazing - but pretty damn nice. Dust doesn't seem to be a problem.
12270,286,32,8.0,2018-09-26,traction,"Super hard rubber and deep grooves work well, but don't expect a lot of squeaking or insane grip."
12271,286,6,9.0,2018-10-01,traction,"The traction on the Lebron 16 is really nice! Even on dusty courts, you will have to wipe only very occasionally."
12272,286,522,9.0,2018-10-01,traction,The best traction of a Lebron since the X.
12273,286,221,10.0,2018-10-01,traction,The Lebron 16 held up extremely well even on the worst courts.
12274,286,701,9.0,2018-10-18,traction,The traction is really good!
12275,286,45,9.0,2019-01-06,traction,The wavy herringbone traction pattern was super impressive.
12276,286,33,10.0,2018-10-04,cushion,The LeBron 16 has a stiffer overall setup that still provides serious impact protection but feels quicker and smoother from the jump.
12277,286,293,8.0,2018-10-02,cushion,"The cushioning of the Lebron 16 is high up off-the-ground and provides insane impact protection and bounce. The responsiveness is okay, but the court feel is minimal."
12278,286,32,9.0,2018-09-26,cushion,The cushioning is a little more responsive and less bouncy than the cushioning of the Lebron 15. This setup works a lot better for guards like me.
12279,286,6,9.0,2018-10-01,cushion,Lower ride and not as bouncy as the Lebron 15. This cushioning is still made for bigger and heavier players and  I would have liked more responsiveness.
12280,286,522,9.0,2018-10-01,cushion,The high-off-the-ground Zoom cushioning provides the perfect balance of impact protection and responsiveness.
12281,286,221,9.0,2018-10-01,cushion,The cushioning isn't as crazy bouncy as it was in the predecessor. This time we get a more versatile and responsive setup.
12282,286,701,9.0,2018-10-18,cushion,The court feel isn't great I love the impact protection!
12283,286,45,9.0,2019-01-06,cushion,The Zoom Max cushioning is super comfortable and provides a ton of impact protection. The cushioning is pretty high off the ground which means you lose a little court feel.
12284,286,33,9.0,2018-10-04,materials,"It isn’t the most premium of materials, but it’s nicer than most and performs well."
12285,286,293,10.0,2018-10-02,materials,The Battleknit 2.0 is pretty soft and pliable from the start.
12286,286,32,9.0,2018-09-26,materials,Battleknit 2.0 feels a lot stronger and more durable than the Battleknit used in the Lebron 15.
12287,286,6,9.0,2018-10-01,materials,"Battleknit 2.0 is really, really nice. This version is thicker and stronger which fixes the containment issues of the Lebron 15."
12288,286,522,9.0,2018-10-01,materials,I really like the use of the thicker and less stretchy Battleknit 2.0
12289,286,221,9.0,2018-10-01,materials,The materials are a standout feature of this shoe.
12290,286,701,9.0,2018-10-18,materials,The upper is a bit more rigid and supportive compared to the Lebron 15.
12291,286,45,8.0,2019-01-06,materials,"The materials are super comfortable, soft, and wrap around your feet very nicely."
12292,286,33,9.0,2018-10-04,support,"Battleknit 2.0 is tighter and less stretchy which improves lateral containment. The wide and stable base, as well as the added outriggers, provide stability on lateral cuts."
12293,286,293,10.0,2018-10-02,support,The support is amazing! Materials don't stretch at all and the lateral stability problems of the Lebron 15 are a thing of the past.
12294,286,32,9.0,2018-09-26,support,The support and lockdown are much improved compared to the Lebron 15.
12295,286,6,9.0,2018-10-01,support,"Zero heel slippage, no side-to-side movement, and the tiny outriggers improve lateral stability a lot!"
12296,286,522,9.0,2018-10-01,support,Stability is drastically improved compared to the Lebron 15 by adding a tiny outrigger.
12297,286,701,8.0,2018-10-18,support,Lockdown is pretty good but the ankle support is only average.
12298,286,45,7.0,2019-01-06,support,The dead space and the fact that the cushioning is pretty high off the ground negatively impacted the stability for me.
12299,286,33,9.0,2018-10-04,fit,After my fourth wear everything about the shoe just formed around my foot when laced tight and there is now no movement at all.
12300,286,293,10.0,2018-10-02,fit,The Lebron 16 fits like a glove!
12301,286,32,9.0,2018-09-26,fit,Nice and comfortable fit after a short break-in period.
12302,286,6,9.0,2018-10-01,fit,The one-bootie upper is easy to put on thanks to the flexible tongue and the additional lower eyelets provide a lot of flexibility to get the perfect fit for your feet.
12303,286,522,8.0,2018-10-01,fit,Í did have a little heel slip in the beginning that was fixed by using the lower eyelet and breaking in the midsole.
12304,286,221,7.0,2018-10-01,fit,I went down half a size but the fit was still sloppy for me. I tried to adjust the lacing but couldn't get rid of the dead space in the toe box.
12305,286,45,7.0,2019-01-06,fit,"The fit is perfect for wide-footers, but I experienced a lot of dead space in the toe box and midfoot."
12306,286,293,100.0,2018-10-02,outdoor,Thick and heavy rubber that should work well outdoors.
12307,286,6,3,2018-10-01,width,"As a wide-footer, I didn't have any issues with the fit."
12308,286,522,3,2018-10-01,width,No dead-space at all for my fat feet.
12309,286,45,4,2019-01-06,width,I had to wear an additional pair of socks with my slightly narrow feet.
12310,286,293,4,2018-10-02,size,We went own half a size for a really snug and tight fit.
12311,286,6,3,2018-10-01,size,Runs true to size.
12312,286,522,4,2018-10-01,size,I went true to size but I feel narrow-footers can go down half a size.
12313,286,701,3,2018-10-18,size,They fit true to size.
12314,287,6,9.0,2018-09-26,expert_overall,The Adidas Pro Bounce Low is a great shoe that is absolutely perfect for me. Everything about this shoe is amazing and the cheap price point makes it even better!
12315,287,293,9.0,2018-09-26,expert_overall,The Adidas Pro Bounce Low is a great all-around shoe that should work especially well for guards.
12316,287,45,8.6,2018-11-29,expert_overall,"Right now, this is by far my favorite shoe to hoop in. If you enjoy playing in low-tops then this is the perfect shoe for you!"
12317,287,33,8.3,2018-10-08,expert_overall,The Pro Bounce Low is a very solid shoe that can be used for all positions.
12318,287,396,9.2,2021-11-09,user_overall,"Type of adidas shoes I love. Nothing spectacular at first sight but you respect them more every time you play. (I own a Mid version btw but they are almost same). Awesome traction. Good support, low-to-ground feeling. OUTRIGGERS. Bounce cushioning is sufficient for indoor play. Nice upper materials, nice lacing. Overall a masterpiece of sports engineering. I'd add a loop on the tongue, though, since it likes to move side to side. Live in my bag as replacement shoe for any wrong gym or situation."
12319,287,708,9.3,2022-03-08,user_overall,Very dependable shoe with amazing traction and durability.

12321,287,6,9.0,2018-09-26,traction,"The bite of the traction pattern is really, really nice."
12322,287,293,9.0,2018-09-26,traction,"Traction is great on clean courts and after a short break-in period, the traction works on dusty courts too."
12323,287,45,8.0,2018-11-29,traction,The traction pattern worked like a charm. The only downside is that it collects a lot of dust on dirty courts.
12324,287,33,9.5,2018-10-08,traction,The spiral pattern provides solid traction from start to finish.
12325,287,6,9.0,2018-09-26,cushion,I think Adidas Bounce is one of the best cushioning setups on the market.
12326,287,293,8.0,2018-09-26,cushion,"The Bounce cushioning is very responsive, low-to-the-court and provides a lot of court feel. Impact protection is still decent."
12327,287,45,9.0,2018-11-29,cushion,The Bounce cushioning is super low profile and very responsive. I might even prefer it over Boost cushioning.
12328,287,33,9.0,2018-10-08,cushion,Bounce cushioning is one of the most well-balanced rides from a foam currently available on the market.
12329,287,6,9.0,2018-09-26,materials,I really enjoyed
12330,287,293,9.0,2018-09-26,materials,The mesh upper with enforced forged fiber stitching is comfortable and very supportive.
12331,287,45,9.0,2018-11-29,materials,"The textile mesh construction which is backed by forged fibre is comfortable, durable and requires no break-in time."
12332,287,33,7.0,2018-10-08,materials,ForgeFiber is a lightweight mesh with additional stitching that works great but feels a little cheap.
12333,287,6,9.0,2018-09-26,support,"I didn't have any heel slippage, lateral containment is great and outriggers keep your feet from rolling."
12334,287,293,10.0,2018-09-26,support,"After the break-in period, I didn't experience any heel slippage or lateral containment issues."
12335,287,45,8.0,2018-11-29,support,"The support comes from the lateral outrigger, internal TPU heel counter, lockdown of the upper and works very well."
12336,287,33,9.0,2018-10-08,support,"Good lockdown, torsional support from two TPU spring plates and a wide and flat outsole with two large outriggers provide great support."
12337,287,6,9.0,2018-09-26,fit,I really enjoyed the fit of the Pro Bounce.
12338,287,45,9.0,2018-11-29,fit,The lacing system really makes the shoe conform to your feet.
12339,287,33,7.0,2018-10-08,fit,I had a little bit of dead space in the toe box but the lockdown was still solid.
12340,287,293,50.0,2018-09-26,outdoor,Outdoor use should be okay.
12341,287,45,3,2018-11-29,width,"Whether you have narrow or wide feet, don't worry about the sizing."
12342,287,293,4,2018-09-26,size,True to my Adidas size (which is half a size smaller than Nike)
12343,287,45,3,2018-11-29,size,Go true to size.
12344,288,293,8.8,2018-10-19,expert_overall,"These are up there on the budget category. I would totally recommend the Jordan Jumpman Hustle, as they are one of the best performers of the year!"
12345,288,6,8.8,2018-10-19,expert_overall,"I think the Jordan Jumpman Hustle is a great performer, especially after you break-in the traction a little bit."
12346,288,33,8.6,2018-10-19,expert_overall,"The Jordan Jumpman Hustle is super comfortable, very lightweight and the shoe won’t break the bank. Traction and cushioning are great but support could be better."
12347,288,86,8.6,2018-11-19,expert_overall,"Overall, the Jordan Jumpman Hustle was a delight to play in."
12348,288,710,8.8,2021-12-08,user_overall,Love the shoes. They have an amazing fit and great traction.
12349,288,293,10.0,2018-10-19,traction,The mostly translucent full-length herringbone traction pattern is really nice.
12350,288,6,9.0,2018-10-19,traction,The traction started off a little disappointing but got much better over time.
12351,288,33,9.0,2018-10-19,traction,Simple herringbone traction works well but tends to clog up a little on dusty courts.
12352,288,86,9.0,2018-11-19,traction,Traditional herringbone traction is used and sometimes it’s the simple things are what work best.
12353,288,293,9.0,2018-10-19,cushion,The cushioning is super low and very responsive with decent impact protection - I was impressed!
12354,288,6,8.5,2018-10-19,cushion,"Provides a little bit of impact protection, bounce and a solid amount of court feel and responsiveness."
12355,288,33,9.0,2018-10-19,cushion,Forefoot Zoom Air and a Phylon midsole feel springy in the forefoot and comfortable in the heel.
12356,288,86,9.0,2018-11-19,cushion,The comfortable cushioning worked very well for me as a heavy-footed big guy.
12357,288,293,8.0,2018-10-19,materials,"The upper is thin, cozy, and feels premium."
12358,288,6,8.5,2018-10-19,materials,"I don't like the look of the synthetic shroud that covers the upper. The mesh material is nothing special, but performs well."
12359,288,33,9.0,2018-10-19,materials,I love the look and feel of the materials on-foot.
12360,288,86,9.0,2018-11-19,materials,"While the material combination is nice, I do wish there was a little bit more strength behind the materials/build."
12361,288,293,8.0,2018-10-19,support,The lockdown and containment are fantastic but there is no real outrigger and the base could be a little wider.
12362,288,6,9.0,2018-10-19,support,"No heel slippage, no side-to-side movement, and good containment."
12363,288,33,7.0,2018-10-19,support,"Support is decent overall, but explosive lateral movements can be a bit problematic because of the stretchy upper material."
12364,288,86,7.0,2018-11-19,support,"Support was good, not great, but good."
12365,288,293,9.0,2018-10-19,fit,"Really nice, snug fit with no dead space."
12366,288,6,9.0,2018-10-19,fit,"Overall, the fit of the one-bootie upper was really nice"
12367,288,33,9.0,2018-10-19,fit,"Lockdown is great from a linear standpoint, but the lateral containment could have been a little stronger."
12368,288,86,9.0,2018-11-19,fit,The Asia release model tested is built on a slightly wider last which worked well for my feet.
12369,288,293,50.0,2018-10-19,outdoor,"The rubber is thick and pretty hard, should be okay outdoors."
12370,288,6,3,2018-10-19,width,I am a slightly wide-footer and I did not have any problems.
12371,288,6,4,2018-10-19,size,I went true to size but the shoe felt a little bit long.
12372,289,6,8.1,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"Personally, I would not recommend the KD11 for basketball because of the missing lateral support. Playing in these shoes had me scared about my ankles."
12373,289,293,8.0,2018-07-16,expert_overall,"The KD 11 is a decent performer, but it just wasn't for me. I would recommend this shoe only to bigger pull-up shooters - there just isn't enough support for quicker players like me."
12374,289,32,8.0,2018-08-08,expert_overall,I was really disappointed because I expected more. The KD11 looks nice and is very comfortable but the performance aspects like support and traction just aren't as good as I had hoped.
12375,289,522,7.8,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"If you want a sock-like shoe with great cushioning then you are going to love the KD11. Unfortunately, the missing support and lacking containment are issues I personally can't ignore in a performance basketball shoe."
12376,289,45,7.4,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"Cushioning, materials, and traction are great. The only problem is the lack of support."
12377,289,649,7.3,2018-08-08,expert_overall,The Nike KD11 looks like a comfortable casual sneaker but doesn't work on a basketball court for me because of the lacking support and stability.
12378,289,33,6.7,2018-08-10,expert_overall,The KD11 is one of the most disappointing shoes I reviewed in a while. The fully knit build is just not supportive enough for a performance basketball shoe - use some leather Nike!
12379,289,560,7.2,2023-12-22,user_overall,"I am a lighter guard with wide feet. I wanted to give the KD line a try and I was disappointed. The heel tabs have left a scar on my ankles from the chafing they caused. The materials felt sturdy and tough, which is a plus for me. This shoe seemed to be a real hit or miss, with user experience dependent on how your ankle is shaped. Sadly, I have bigger ankles than the audience Nike designed these for, and I could never shake the weird feeling during use. They are durable as hell."
12380,289,564,7.8,2021-11-16,user_overall,I really like this shoe. But the downfall of this shoe is the pull tab where it digs in my Achilles and it hurts a lot.
12381,289,15,8.2,2022-11-15,user_overall,Outdoor players are lucky to explore this tbh.    :)

12384,289,6,7.5,2018-09-26,traction,"The translucent rubber offers great stopping power on clean courts, but on more dusty courts it was super inconsistent."
12385,289,293,9.0,2018-07-16,traction,"The traction of the KD 11 is good, even on a dusty court."
12386,289,32,8.0,2018-08-08,traction,The traction is pretty inconsistent - works very well on clean courts but slides a lot on dusty courts.
12387,289,522,8.0,2018-09-26,traction,"Works fine on clean courts, needs some wiping on dirty courts."
12388,289,45,8.0,2018-09-26,traction,The traction is fantastic and holds up even on mildly dusty courts.
12389,289,649,8.0,2018-08-08,traction,The traction started off very nicely but seemed to fade a little after breaking it in.
12390,289,33,7.0,2018-08-10,traction,The rubber frays easily and dust gets clogged in the narrow traction pattern instantly.
12391,289,6,9.5,2018-09-26,cushion,The combination of React and full-length Zoom is freaking amazing.
12392,289,293,9.0,2018-07-16,cushion,"The nice and plush insole provides great step-in comfort.  The cushioning started off stiff, but after a while, I could feel the full-length Zoom that is similar to the cushioning of the Why Not Zero.1."
12393,289,32,9.0,2018-08-08,cushion,React's impact protection and Zoom Air's responsiveness is a crazy combination!
12394,289,522,9.0,2018-09-26,cushion,The React + Zoom cushioning feels great underfoot with a nice bounce and without any lag.
12395,289,45,9.0,2018-09-26,cushion,"Combining React and Zoom gives you low-profile responsiveness, comfort, and a lot of bounciness."
12396,289,649,8.0,2018-08-08,cushion,"The cushioning is very comfortable and provides a ton of impact protection. Unfortunately, it's also clunky, stiff and doesn't give you much court feel or responsiveness."
12397,289,33,9.5,2018-08-10,cushion,The combination of React and Zoom Air is money!
12398,289,6,8.0,2018-09-26,materials,The implementation of the Flyknit upper could have been better.
12399,289,293,9.0,2018-07-16,materials,The upper materials need a little to break in but feel very nice afterwards.
12400,289,32,8.0,2018-08-08,materials,"Overall, the materials are okay. The toe box and the heel counter are very sturdy, the mid-foot upper is soft and comfortable. I would have liked more padding on the inside of the tongue."
12401,289,522,8.0,2018-09-26,materials,Feels nice and comfortable and premium but does nothing performance wise in my opinion.
12402,289,45,8.0,2018-09-26,materials,The Flyknit upper is very light and feels great on foot.
12403,289,33,7.0,2018-08-10,materials,The Flyknit is just too soft for a performance basketball.
12404,289,6,7.0,2018-09-26,support,Lockdown in the heel was fine but I felt my foot slipping off the footbed a lot. This feels like a very dangerous shoe to play in if you do a lot of lateral cuts.
12405,289,293,5.0,2018-07-16,support,"I was sliding all over the place in this shoe because the upper material is not strong enough to provide the necessary lockdown. If you rely on cuts and crossovers, then this shoe is not for you."
12406,289,32,7.0,2018-08-08,support,The support was a downer for me as the mid-foot panel is too stretchy for my liking. I was always afraid of ankle sprains because my feet were rolling over on hard lateral cuts.
12407,289,522,7.0,2018-09-26,support,The upper is super stretchy and doesn't provide a lot of containment. Stability is fine even if there is basically no heel counter.
12408,289,45,5.0,2018-09-26,support,There is barely any support in this shoe. If you do a lateral cut or a step back your foot almost falls out of the shoe - not comfortable!!
12409,289,649,5.0,2018-08-08,support,The horrible heel lockdown and constant front-to-back movement inside the shoe didn't inspire confidence for hard cuts and crossovers.
12410,289,33,5.0,2018-08-10,support,Because of the stretchy and sloppy materials I never felt safe playing in these shoes.
12411,289,6,8.5,2018-09-26,fit,The fit of the one-bootie upper is really nice after a short break-in period.
12412,289,522,7.0,2018-09-26,fit,There is a good amount of heel slip to start but it gets a lot better after the break-in period.
12413,289,45,7.0,2018-09-26,fit,The overall fit was pretty good but not outstanding.
12414,289,649,8.0,2018-08-08,fit,"I don't like the sock-construction often used in modern basketball shoes, but the harness-like system hidden under the Flyknit upper improved the comfort a little bit for me."
12415,289,33,5.0,2018-08-10,fit,Never once did I feel securely locked into the shoe.
12416,289,293,0.0,2018-07-16,outdoor,I wouldn't recommend this shoe outdoors because of the soft rubber.
12417,289,45,0.0,2018-09-26,outdoor,Would I take them outdoors? Probably not.
12418,289,293,2,2018-07-16,width,Runs narrow like we are used to from KD shoes.
12419,289,45,2,2018-09-26,width,Slightly narrow like all Durant's shoes.
12420,289,293,5,2018-07-16,size,Long and narrow like every KD shoe ever.
12421,289,522,4,2018-09-26,size,Going down half a size should be the right choice except for the widest-footers.
12422,289,45,3,2018-09-26,size,Fits just like the KD9 or KD10. I went true to size and this worked perfectly for me.
12423,290,32,9.0,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"Good traction, good cushioning and the support and lockdown are on point. The materials may look cheap but they perform well.  Overall, a very solid hoops shoe!"
12424,290,649,8.5,2018-10-08,expert_overall,"The latest Nike Kobe A.D. isn't spectacular, but it is an easy recommendation for players whose priorities lean towards light, minimal, and low shoes."
12425,290,6,8.5,2018-10-30,expert_overall,"It's a great performing shoe, but for a Kobe signature model, the look and in-hand feel of the materials are disappointing."
12426,290,615,8.4,2018-10-01,expert_overall,"I like everything about this shoe! I just wished they would have taken the cushion from the Kobe AD NXT 360, because then it would have been my shoe of the year!"
12427,290,522,8.4,2018-10-16,expert_overall,It doesn't have the latest and greatest tech but this is definitely one of the more fun shoes I played in this year.
12428,290,176,8.3,2018-10-01,expert_overall,"The Kobe AD Exodus isn't the best Kobe ever, but it does almost everything well on-court and is smooth on foot. Works especially well for quicker ""Kyrie-like"" guards."
12429,290,33,8.2,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"I like the Nike Kobe AD Exodus but I don’t love it. The Exodus is lightweight, low profile, and provides aggressive traction — it’s a shoe built for a fast-paced player that gets up and down the court."
12430,290,221,8.0,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"I am having fun in the Kobe AD, but the traction is problematic."
12431,290,293,7.1,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"Tech-wise it's not great but performance is solid and it looks good. Overall, we are a little underwhelmed though and the Kobe AD Exodus probably won't make it into our rotation."
12432,290,192,8.3,2024-03-16,user_overall,"As my first-ever pair of Kobes, these would fit the description of an ""entry-level sneaker"". Traction was good, cushion was average as this is a shoe meant most for guard and support was average. Materials could've been better and the fit was a little strange for me at first, but overall a solid performer nonetheless."
12433,290,527,9.4,2022-11-09,user_overall,"One of my favorite shoes. Amazing court feel, responsiveness, and bounce. My one downfall would be the limited customizable fit without a tongue, it's more of a slip on, luckily they fit my foot pretty great."
12434,290,712,8.4,2022-04-03,user_overall,I really like these shoes. They have lasted through me and my brother for five years. Their traction is very good for what is left on them and I wish I had a new par.

12437,290,32,8.0,2018-09-26,traction,The traction is a strong suit of the Kobe AD Exodus and works especially well on clean courts.
12438,290,649,9.0,2018-10-08,traction,The translucent rubber provides outstanding traction and required very little wiping.
12439,290,6,8.5,2018-10-30,traction,"Overall, the traction was pretty good but I did have some slip-ups on a very dusty court. After a quick wipe, you are ready to go again."
12440,290,615,9.0,2018-10-01,traction,"The Kobe AD Exodus picks up a lot of dust, but it didn't affect performance at all."
12441,290,522,9.0,2018-10-16,traction,Looks similar as the NXT360 but performs better for me. Feels a little tackier and picks up little dust.
12442,290,176,9.0,2018-10-01,traction,"Traction works well on clean courts but on dusty courts, you have to wipe every 4-5 possessions."
12443,290,33,9.0,2018-09-26,traction,I've had nothing but a positive experience with the traction.
12444,290,221,6.0,2018-09-26,traction,I was slipping all over the place.
12445,290,293,6.5,2018-09-26,traction,It started off really bad but got better with time. The Kobe AD Exodus picks up a lot of dust and is hard to wipe.
12446,290,32,9.0,2018-09-26,cushion,"The cushioning is responsive, bouncy and springy - I like it!"
12447,290,649,8.0,2018-10-08,cushion,The Phylon forefoot lacks the dynamic response of Air Zoom but provides excellent court feel and a very speedy feel which works perfectly for fast guards. The Air Zoom in the heel provides decent impact protection.
12448,290,6,8.5,2018-10-30,cushion,The forefoot is low-to-the-ground and responsive with a lot of court feel. The Zoom unit in the heel provides bounciness and impact protection.
12449,290,615,7.0,2018-10-01,cushion,The stiff Phylon in the forefoot did tire my feet after a while of playing.
12450,290,522,8.0,2018-10-16,cushion,"The Zoom Air units in Phylon carrier feels plush, absorbing and springy enough. I think most players will like this setup - I sure did."
12451,290,176,9.0,2018-10-01,cushion,"Huge 14mm Zoom Air unit in the heel and basic injected Phylon in the forefoot. Not bad, but I would prefer full-length Zoom cushioning."
12452,290,33,9.0,2018-09-26,cushion,At $140 I expect better forefoot cushioning than injected Phylon. The heel Zoom Air unit is nice.
12453,290,221,9.0,2018-09-26,cushion,I liked the bouncier cushioning setup of the Exodus compared to other current Kobe models. I felt very explosive and responsive.
12454,290,293,8.0,2018-09-26,cushion,"The cushioning in the heel feels great. The forefoot has very little cushioning but is therefore very responsive. Overall, the shoe felt high-off-the-ground."
12455,290,32,8.0,2018-09-26,materials,"The materials are not premium but feel good, fit good and get the job done."
12456,290,6,8.0,2018-10-30,materials,The materials used in the Exodus are not up to par with other Kobe models like the AD NXT 360. On-court performance of the materials is solid.
12457,290,615,8.0,2018-10-01,materials,The synthetic felt-like upper materials looks a little cheap but offered great containment and performance.
12458,290,522,8.0,2018-10-16,materials,The materials feel kinda cheap but work fine.
12459,290,176,7.0,2018-10-01,materials,"I’ve seen better, but the materials work."
12460,290,33,7.0,2018-09-26,materials,"The performance wasn't hindered by the materials, but the synthetic felt-like suede upper feels and looks cheap."
12461,290,221,8.0,2018-09-26,materials,The materials feel a little cheap but perform well.
12462,290,293,7.0,2018-09-26,materials,The materials don't feel premium on-hand or on-feet but perform well.
12463,290,649,9.0,2018-10-08,support,The sculpted collar padding and external heel counter provide the excellent stability we know from the Kobe line.
12464,290,6,9.0,2018-10-30,support,"No heel slippage, no slipping on the footbed and no lateral instability."
12465,290,615,9.0,2018-10-01,support,"Not once did I feel insecure in these shoes! No lateral movement, great lockdown, and stable base."
12466,290,522,8.0,2018-10-16,support,The support was fine for a Low-cut. Stability is great in the forefoot and just a little unstable and squishy in the heel.
12467,290,176,7.0,2018-10-01,support,Standard heel counter and raised midsole in the heel do an okay job. The missing lateral outrigger and midfoot shank didn't negatively impact stability.
12468,290,33,9.0,2018-09-26,support,The outsole is flat and the forefoot section is slightly wider to provide stability. Your foot sits within the midsole which acts as a natural outrigger - a setup I love.
12469,290,221,8.0,2018-09-26,support,"The lockdown in the forefoot is absolutely fantastic, the midfoot and heel felt a little slippery out-of-the-box."
12470,290,293,7.0,2018-09-26,support,I didn't feel as stable on lateral cuts as in previous Kobe models.
12471,290,32,8.0,2018-09-26,fit,Feels light and comfortable.
12472,290,649,8.0,2018-10-08,fit,I am not a fan of the sock-like construction and its lack of adjustability. But the Kobe AD Exodus provides above average fit considering the limitations of this construction.
12473,290,6,8.5,2018-10-30,fit,Feels like it hugs my feet except for the flimsy and soft toebox.
12474,290,615,9.0,2018-10-01,fit,The lacing system is fire!
12475,290,522,9.0,2018-10-16,fit,The fit is great with no heel slip or other movement inside the shoes.
12476,290,176,9.5,2018-10-01,fit,Lockdown is complete and total.
12477,290,33,7.0,2018-09-26,fit,"Lockdown is pretty good but a standard, separate tongue would have made it much easier to customize the fit to your feet."
12478,290,221,9.0,2018-09-26,fit,The fit is very good overall.
12479,290,293,7.0,2018-09-26,fit,The fit was kind of weird. Narrow but a little too much space in the toe-box.
12480,290,6,0.0,2018-10-30,outdoor,I would not recommend outdoor use because of the nubs used in the traction pattern.
12481,290,293,0.0,2018-09-26,outdoor,No outdoor use for these!
12482,290,6,3,2018-10-30,width,These felt perfectly fine for me as a wide-footer.
12483,290,522,2,2018-10-16,width,The midfoot is pretty narrow.
12484,290,293,2,2018-09-26,width,The fit is rather narrow.
12485,290,6,3,2018-10-30,size,Runs true to size.
12486,290,522,3,2018-10-16,size,Go true to size unless you have very wide feet.
12487,290,293,4,2018-09-26,size,I experienced a good amount of toe-space.
12488,291,6,8.8,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"For a retail price of $100, this is an outstanding shoe."
12489,291,33,8.7,2018-09-26,expert_overall,If the Curry 3 Zero2 came with a heel counter it would be the perfect guard shoe.
12490,291,522,8.6,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"The Steph Curry 3 Zero2 does almost everything exceptionally well with traction, fit and stability being the very high highlights."
12491,291,293,7.2,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"The performance is okay for a budget model, but these won't make it into the rotation."
12492,291,350,8.2,2023-04-08,user_overall,The shoes traction was very good but it's cushionimg was hard and it was very uncomfortable to wear If u want this show I suggest going up half a size or a size it also hurts your feet when u play and u risk injury overall I don't recommend
12493,291,169,8.3,2023-10-20,user_overall,Very solid shoe doesn’t really shine in one area but its overall good. Dust pickup wasn’t an issue had a fun time in this shoe.

12497,291,6,9.0,2018-09-26,traction,I had no problems at all with this traction.
12498,291,33,9.5,2018-09-26,traction,"Traction on the Curry 3ZER0 2 is aggressive, rugged, and covers every direction."
12499,291,522,9.0,2018-09-26,traction,This traction pattern is great and works well on all surfaces.
12500,291,293,7.0,2018-09-26,traction,The traction was a little bit lackluster. Dust didn't really affect the performance.
12501,291,6,9.5,2018-09-26,cushion,"The MicroG and Charged cushioning feels really, really nice!"
12502,291,33,9.0,2018-09-26,cushion,This shoe has the cushion that the Curry 5 lacked without the loss of court feel.
12503,291,522,8.0,2018-09-26,cushion,"If you want low to the ground but more than adequate impact protection, you’ll really like these."
12504,291,293,7.0,2018-09-26,cushion,Very responsive but the impact protection is not great. My feet did hurt a little bit after playing for a while.
12505,291,6,8.5,2018-09-26,materials,The materials are super soft and feel really nice.
12506,291,33,9.0,2018-09-26,materials,I really liked the 3ZER0 2’s upper and the way it wrapped around my foot.
12507,291,522,8.0,2018-09-26,materials,The Maxprene upper material feels like a stronger less stretchy version of neoprene and is very comfortable.
12508,291,293,8.0,2018-09-26,materials,The Maxprene upper feels very comfortable but isn't crazy supportive.
12509,291,6,8.5,2018-09-26,support,"On hard cuts, you sometimes slip out of the footbed a little bit because of the flexible upper materials. Otherwise the support was really nice."
12510,291,33,7.0,2018-09-26,support,"Wide outsole and great forefoot outrigger, but I would have liked the addition of a heel counter."
12511,291,522,9.0,2018-09-26,support,"No heel counter at all, but stability is outstanding thanks to the wide outsole and outrigger."
12512,291,293,7.0,2018-09-26,support,No heel slippage but the materials stretched a little too much and there is virtually no ankle support
12513,291,6,8.5,2018-09-26,fit,Pretty good 1:1 fit for my slightly wide feet.
12514,291,33,9.0,2018-09-26,fit,The 3ZER0 2 just sucks your feet into the shoe.
12515,291,522,9.0,2018-09-26,fit,Fits like a sock - no dead space at all!
12516,291,293,7.0,2018-09-26,fit,"The fit started off well but after a while, I started swimming in these. I used an extra insole which improved the fit a lot."
12517,291,293,50.0,2018-09-26,outdoor,"Even though the rubber is soft, the deep grooves will probably do fine outdoors."
12518,291,522,3,2018-09-26,width,Fits like a glove in true to size.
12519,291,293,3,2018-09-26,width,This shoe is pretty narrow like every Curry.
12520,291,522,3,2018-09-26,size,True to size so simple people!!
12521,291,293,4,2018-09-26,size,I went true to size and had a few mm extra space in the forefoot.
12522,292,293,9.3,2018-10-16,expert_overall,"The HOVR cushioning was a bit disappointing, but other than that, the Under Armour HOVR Havoc is an amazing performer with awesome traction and a very minimal, low-to-the-ground feel."
12523,292,176,9.1,2018-10-12,expert_overall,"If you are looking for a seriously quick, responsive, biting-traction shoe, the HOVR Havoc Low will more than satisfy."
12524,292,6,8.9,2018-10-01,expert_overall,This is one of my top 5 performance basketball shoes of 2018 so far!
12525,292,522,8.2,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"Okay overall, but nothing great aside from traction, stability, and containment."
12526,292,651,8.4,2021-11-29,user_overall,
12527,292,715,8.8,2022-02-03,user_overall,
12528,292,293,10.0,2018-10-16,traction,The traction has a great bite and picks up very little dust!
12529,292,176,9.5,2018-10-12,traction,Herringbone from heel to toe works well even on dusty courts!
12530,292,6,9.0,2018-10-01,traction,The traction pattern bites really hard with great stopping power.
12531,292,522,9.0,2018-09-26,traction,The traditional herringbone traction pattern is very similar to the Curry 3 and works great.
12532,292,293,8.0,2018-10-16,cushion,"The HOVR cushioning is insanely caged and super hard. Great court feel and responsiveness, decent impact protection but not very bouncy."
12533,292,176,9.0,2018-10-12,cushion,The HOVR cushioning is caged to provide more response and to feel more stable than the HOVR cushioning we know from running shoes.
12534,292,6,9.0,2018-10-01,cushion,The HOVR cushioning started off really stiff but after breaking it in the cushioning in the heel started to feel amazing.
12535,292,522,7.0,2018-09-26,cushion,The cushioning is very firm out the box and takes a lot of break-in because it’s sandwiched too much.
12536,292,293,9.0,2018-10-16,materials,The materials are very thin and soft while also providing good support.
12537,292,176,9.0,2018-10-12,materials,"The upper is made from rather cheap fuse and mesh, but the HOVR Havoc Low uses it smartly to create a supremely comfy sneaker."
12538,292,6,8.5,2018-10-01,materials,"The upper is made completely from mesh with some TPU overlays in the toebox and the laterals side of the forefoot. Usually, this would feel cheap, but in this case, the upper requires almost no break-in period and performs great!"
12539,292,522,8.0,2018-09-26,materials,The Mesh and synthetic panels are in all the right places and work well.
12540,292,293,10.0,2018-10-16,support,This is a very wide and stable shoe. Lateral containment and lockdown are awesome!
12541,292,176,9.0,2018-10-12,support,The HOVR Havoc Low has a super-wide fat-booty heel that rides flat on the floor and helps you feel safe and stable.
12542,292,6,9.0,2018-10-01,support,"Even though this is a low cut, I always felt stable, safe, and locked down!"
12543,292,522,9.0,2018-09-26,support,Stability is very good with a low-to-the-ground forefoot and wide outsole
12544,292,176,9.0,2018-10-12,fit,Perfect fit in the mid- and forefoot but I experienced some lace pressure around the ankle.
12545,292,6,9.0,2018-10-01,fit,This shoe fits like a glove!
12546,292,522,8.0,2018-09-26,fit,Forefoot to midfoot fit great out of the box but the heel gave me some serious slip due to the stiffness of the outsole and placement of the top eyelets.
12547,292,293,100.0,2018-10-16,outdoor,The rubber is super hard and should work fine outdoors!
12548,292,522,2,2018-09-26,width,The fit in the forefoot is rather snug.
12549,292,6,3,2018-10-01,size,Go true to size.
12550,292,522,3,2018-09-26,size,Fits true to size.
12551,293,6,8.0,2018-09-26,expert_overall,I would not recommend this shoe as it felt super stiff and clunky.
12552,293,293,7.4,2018-09-26,expert_overall,I didn't really enjoy playing in these shoes. Probably works better if you are a big guy who plays in the low post.
12553,293,6,8.5,2018-09-26,traction,The traction is probably the best aspect of this shoe. Works well on clean and dusty courts.
12554,293,293,7.0,2018-09-26,traction,"Works well on clean courts, but on dirty courts, it's pretty impossible to wipe off the dust."
12555,293,6,7.5,2018-09-26,cushion,"I couldn't really feel the React cushioning. Overall, the cushioning felt awkward and was really disappointing."
12556,293,293,7.0,2018-09-26,cushion,"The React cushioning is heavily caged and doesn't feel very comfortable. Overall, it's not horrible but I was pretty disappointed."
12557,293,6,8.0,2018-09-26,materials,The materials are too stiff and restrictive for my liking.
12558,293,293,7.0,2018-09-26,materials,"The materials are pretty stiff, not breathable, and feel bulky."
12559,293,6,8.0,2018-09-26,support,Support is pretty good. I had no heel slippage or side-to-side movements in the footbed.
12560,293,293,8.0,2018-09-26,support,Lateral containment and ankle support are good but the very stiff external heel counter was pretty uncomfortable.
12561,293,6,8.0,2018-09-26,fit,I had to take off the shoe at times because my forefoot cramped up.
12562,293,293,8.0,2018-09-26,fit,The stiffer upper materials are not very comfortable but fit pretty well after a break-in period.
12563,293,293,0.0,2018-09-26,outdoor,Outdoor use is not recommended because of the pretty soft rubber.
12564,293,293,1,2018-09-26,width,It's really narrow and the upper material doesn't stretch out a lot.
12565,293,293,4,2018-09-26,size,I went down half a size like I always do in Jordan shoes.
12566,294,6,8.7,2018-07-16,expert_overall,"For $110, you will not be disappointed! The Kyrie Low is a good all-around performer and a lot of fun to play in."
12567,294,176,8.7,2018-10-20,expert_overall,"The package of traction, court feel, and fit make the Kyrie Low ideal for most guards and any other player not needing a wide shoe or supreme cushioning."
12568,294,293,8.4,2018-08-08,expert_overall,I really enjoyed playing in the Kyrie Low. If you don't need a lot of impact protection then this shoe is a great choice!
12569,294,33,7.8,2018-10-12,expert_overall,"Better than the Kyrie 2 and 1, but not as good as the Kyrie 3 or 4."
12570,294,716,9.0,2022-04-29,user_overall,"my first ever kyrie shoe and I've loved it for volleyball. The front-loaded zoom unit allows for explosive jumping and quick movements from side to side. Would recommend these shoes to anyone with narrow feet, and want a durable explosive feeling shoe."

12573,294,6,9.0,2018-07-16,traction,"I had no slippage whatsoever! Even if the outsole picks up dust, it still bites the floor very well."
12574,294,176,9.5,2018-10-20,traction,"Kyrie models always have great traction, and the Kyrie Low doesn't dissapoint."
12575,294,293,9.0,2018-08-08,traction,"Not quite on Kyrie 2 level, but still very good!"
12576,294,33,8.0,2018-10-12,traction,"Traction isn't as good as the Kyrie 2,3 or 4 but still decent."
12577,294,6,9.0,2018-07-16,cushion,Full-length Phylon midsole with bottom-loaded Zoom Air units in the front and heel. I have nothing to complain about!
12578,294,176,9.0,2018-10-20,cushion,"You can't really feel the forefoot and heel Zoom Air units because of the stiff Phylon midsole. However, you get a lot of court feel and responsiveness which should be great for quick guards like Kyrie."
12579,294,293,7.0,2018-08-08,cushion,"There is some compression in the heel and adequate impact protection. Other than that, you feel very low-to-the-ground and responsive."
12580,294,33,8.0,2018-10-12,cushion,I couldn't really feel the Nike Zoom Air units.
12581,294,6,8.0,2018-07-16,materials,The mesh on the upper feels a lot cheaper than the material used in the regular Kyrie 4. It starts off really stiff but breaks in over time.
12582,294,176,7.0,2018-10-20,materials,"The heavily glued, canvas-style fabric took some serious break-in time."
12583,294,293,8.0,2018-08-08,materials,"The materials aren't looking great and feel cheap in hand, but they are comfortable and get the job done!"
12584,294,33,7.0,2018-10-12,materials,"The materials are basic: Mesh, nylon, and fuse in certain high-wear areas. I experienced some splitting off on the toe box after a few toe-drags."
12585,294,6,9.0,2018-07-16,support,No lateral movements and heel slippage was fixed by cranking down the laces in the top area.
12586,294,176,9.0,2018-10-20,support,The low-riding midsole and the lacing system lock you in tightly and provide solid support.
12587,294,293,9.0,2018-08-08,support,"Like always in Kyrie's models, support and lockdown are amazing"
12588,294,33,8.0,2018-10-12,support,"Lockdown is nothing special and the strap doesn't do a ton. But overall, support is decent for a low-cut."
12589,294,6,8.5,2018-07-16,fit,"I experienced needles when I cranked the laces in the forefoot too much. As a slight wide-footer, this is not a perfect choice."
12590,294,176,9.0,2018-10-20,fit,"The shoe pulls nice and tight around your foot, locking everything from the midfoot forward in and down with no movement at all."
12591,294,293,9.0,2018-08-08,fit,The fit starts off a bit tight but loosens up after the break-in period.
12592,294,33,8.0,2018-10-12,fit,I do like the way they fit. Very similar to the Kyrie 1.
12593,294,293,0.0,2018-08-08,outdoor,The super soft rubber will probably not work outdoors.
12594,294,293,2,2018-08-08,width,This shoe is pretty narrow.
12595,294,293,4,2018-08-08,size,I would suggest going down half a size.
12596,295,6,8.0,2018-08-08,expert_overall,I would not recommend this shoe for $140. The traction is pretty bad and the fit didn't work for me.
12597,295,615,7.8,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"The D Rose 9 is a solid performer, but there are better performers at a more affordable price out there."
12598,295,293,7.5,2018-08-08,expert_overall,"We loved the cushioning! Unfortunately, the traction is lackluster and the fit works only for players with very wide feet."
12599,295,176,7.0,2018-08-08,expert_overall,"If you require traction and lockdown from your basketball shoes you need to look elsewhere. You should only get the D Rose 9 if you are a stationary shooter, you don't rely on quickness and you like the look and casual appeal of the D Rose 9."
12600,295,6,6.5,2018-08-08,traction,The traction of the D Rose 9 is atrocious - especially on dusty courts.
12601,295,615,7.0,2018-09-26,traction,The traction pattern is probably the most inconsistent I ever experienced.
12602,295,293,6.0,2018-08-08,traction,"On a dusty court, you have to wipe after every play!"
12603,295,176,7.0,2018-08-08,traction,"On a clean court, the traction is decent. But the lines of the traction pattern are really close together and attract a on of dust."
12604,295,6,8.5,2018-08-08,cushion,"Low-to-the-ground feeling in the forefoot and thicker cushioning in the rear. I would have liked a little more bounce in the forefoot, but I can't really complain."
12605,295,615,8.0,2018-09-26,cushion,"I usually like Bounce cushioning, but my knees didn't like the tougher setup of the D Rose 9."
12606,295,293,10.0,2018-08-08,cushion,"The Bounce cushioning provides good impact protection, great court feel and responsiveness and a slight bounce."
12607,295,176,9.0,2018-08-08,cushion,The Bounce cushioning offers great court feel and the impact protection is fine - I just didn't fall in love with it.
12608,295,6,8.5,2018-08-08,materials,"The knitted materials feel amazing on-foot, but they tend to get hot after playing a while."
12609,295,615,8.0,2018-09-26,materials,"The knit upper is nice, flexible and durable."
12610,295,293,9.0,2018-08-08,materials,We like the soft and thin knitted materials.
12611,295,176,7.0,2018-08-08,materials,The materials are a bright spot and bring a casual appeal to the D Rose 9.
12612,295,6,9.0,2018-08-08,support,No side-to-side movement and zero heel slippage.
12613,295,615,8.0,2018-09-26,support,I felt secure and comfortable thanks to the strong lockdown and internal heel counter.
12614,295,176,7.0,2018-08-08,support,"The materials are just not enough to keep hard-driving, slashing players contained."
12615,295,6,7.5,2018-08-08,fit,There is a lot of dead space in the toe box.
12616,295,615,8.0,2018-09-26,fit,I should have gone down half a size. But after using extra insoles and a second pair of socks the fit was good.
12617,295,293,5.0,2018-08-08,fit,Doesn't work very well for narrow feet.
12618,295,176,5.0,2018-08-08,fit,"The fit was way too big in my regular 10.5. Combine this, with the soft knit and roomy toe box and my feet were swimming inside the D Rose 9."
12619,295,293,0.0,2018-08-08,outdoor,"The rubber is very pliable and thin, I wouldn't use these outdoors."
12620,295,293,5,2018-08-08,width,If you are a wide-footer you are going to love this shoe!
12621,295,293,5,2018-08-08,size,"I went down a full size, this shoe runs very long."
12622,296,32,9.5,2018-08-08,expert_overall,"This is an awesome performer with great tech at an affordable price. Cushion, traction, and materials stayed the same but the fit and support are slightly improved!"
12623,296,6,8.8,2018-08-08,expert_overall,I would pick the PG 2.5 over the PG 2 as they look better and provide a more customizable fit thanks to the forefoot strap.
12624,296,293,8.2,2018-08-08,expert_overall,The performance stayed exactly the same but we think the PG 2.5 looks better than the PG2.

12630,296,32,9.0,2018-08-08,traction,"There are some minor slips here and there, but overall, the traction is really, really solid."
12631,296,6,9.0,2018-08-08,traction,The traction pattern is great and holds up well on dusty courts.
12632,296,293,8.0,2018-08-08,traction,Dust isn't a huge problem but the stopping power was never great.
12633,296,32,9.0,2018-08-08,cushion,The combination of Phylon and Zoom Air is straight fire!
12634,296,6,8.5,2018-08-08,cushion,I still wish that they had introduced a Zoom unit in the heel for a more forgiving cushioning.
12635,296,293,6.0,2018-08-08,cushion,You can feel the forefoot Zoom a little but the heel is completely dead.
12636,296,32,9.0,2018-08-08,materials,"The materials are light, soft, flexible and don't require any break-in time."
12637,296,6,8.5,2018-08-08,materials,The materials aren't premium but they get the job done.
12638,296,293,9.0,2018-08-08,materials,"The materials are a little different compared to the Nike PG 2, but they are qeually nice!"
12639,296,32,9.0,2018-08-08,support,The strap that was added to the 2.5 adds a little more support in the forefoot and removes the heel slippage I experienced in the previous model.
12640,296,6,9.0,2018-08-08,support,I had no heel slippage at all and the forefoot strap provides a more customizable fit in the front.
12641,296,293,9.0,2018-08-08,support,The forefoot strap adds a little more support to an already very supportive shoe.
12642,296,6,9.0,2018-08-08,fit,Pretty good 1:1 fit.
12643,296,293,9.0,2018-08-08,fit,The PG2 is easy to get on and super comfortable.
12644,296,293,0.0,2018-08-08,outdoor,"The translucent rubber is wearing off quickly, even indoors."
12645,296,6,2,2018-08-08,width,A little bit narrow in the forefoot.
12646,296,293,2,2018-08-08,width,The PG 2.5 is slightly narrow.

12648,296,293,3,2018-08-08,size,Runs true to size.

12652,297,45,7.0,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"The Hyperdunk X is an above average performer. The fit, materials, and support do very well. Unfortunately, the traction on mildly dusty courts is a bit disappointing."

12656,297,176,9.0,2018-09-26,traction,Works well on every kind of court - I am not sure I ever wiped the outsole while wearing the Hyperdunk X.
12657,297,6,8.0,2018-09-26,traction,"The wavy traction pattern worked well on clean courts. On dusty courts, you lose a lot of bite and need to wipe from time to time."
12658,297,522,8.0,2019-01-13,traction,The traction took a little break-in time but did a good job overall.
12659,297,45,6.0,2018-09-26,traction,"The traction didn't really give me the amount of grip that I personally like, especially on dusty courts."
12660,297,176,9.5,2018-09-26,cushion,"The cushioning is fantastic. No pain, no aches, no harsh jarring from landing, and it feels quick and bouncy on every move."
12661,297,6,8.5,2018-09-26,cushion,The Air Zoom units in the heel and forefoot give you solid bounce and decent impact protection.
12662,297,522,9.0,2019-01-13,cushion,"The Zoom cushioning is a nice blend of comfort, impact protection, and springiness."
12663,297,45,7.0,2018-09-26,cushion,The Zoom Air units in the heel and forefoot get the job done. But I can't help but feel like it's a step back from React cushioning in the Hyperdunk 2017 or the full-length Zoom of the Hyperdunk 2016.
12664,297,176,7.0,2018-09-26,materials,"The materials are…okay. Nothing is premium except for the little bit of leather on the heel cup, but it works."
12665,297,6,8.5,2018-09-26,materials,"The materials feel pretty standard, definitely not premium. However, the shoe is well ventilated and the materials get the job done."
12666,297,522,8.0,2019-01-13,materials,"Nothing fancy, but the textile upper is thick, comfortable, and requires zero break-in time."
12667,297,45,7.0,2018-09-26,materials,The upper materials are basic but get the job done.
12668,297,176,9.0,2018-09-26,support,"The lacing system pulls the shoe tightly and securely around your foot. The heel counter, midfoot shank, and the small outriggers also help with support."
12669,297,6,9.0,2018-09-26,support,"Huge heel counter prevents heel slippage, lateral outrigger provides a lot of stability and there is no side-to-side movement in the footbed."
12670,297,522,8.0,2019-01-13,support,"Flat outsole and outrigger, midfoot shank, and tight lacing system combine for a very supportive shoe."
12671,297,45,7.0,2018-09-26,support,The support is not outstanding but still above average.
12672,297,176,9.0,2018-09-26,fit,The fit is accommodating to different foot-shapes and needs.
12673,297,6,9.0,2018-09-26,fit,The fit is pretty nice even though it is hard to get your feet into these shoes.
12674,297,522,9.0,2019-01-13,fit,"No side-to-side movement,heel slip, or deadspace in the toe box. Awesome job!"
12675,297,45,8.0,2018-09-26,fit,The Hyperdunk X fits like a glove.

12677,297,6,2,2018-09-26,width,A little bit narrow in the forefoot.
12678,297,6,3,2018-09-26,size,"If you have wide feet go up half a size, regular feet go true to size."
12679,297,522,3,2019-01-13,size,True to size for almost everyone except the wide footers.
12680,297,45,3,2018-09-26,size,I suggest going true to size.

12700,298,45,7.0,2018-09-26,support,"The overall lockdown, the heel counter, and the lateral outrigger really get the job done."

12704,298,293,0.0,2018-08-08,outdoor,I wouldn't recommend outdoor use because the rubber is super soft.
12705,298,45,50.0,2018-09-26,outdoor,The deep grooves should do well outdoors.
12706,298,293,2,2018-08-08,width,I would not recommend this shoe for wide-footers.
12707,298,45,3,2018-09-26,width,My slightly wide feet were locked in nicely.
12708,298,293,4,2018-08-08,size,I went down half a size because Hperdunks always run a little long for me.

12716,299,176,9.0,2018-06-12,traction,The wide traction pattern works very well and doesn't pick up dust.
12717,299,293,9.0,2018-06-12,cushion,The cushioning is much softer and plushy as you would suspect from a Phylon carrier - we were pleasantly surprised!
12718,299,33,9.0,2018-08-08,cushion,Lightweight Phylon midsole and forefoot Zoom session provides a great balance between impact protection and responsiveness.
12719,299,176,7.0,2018-06-12,cushion,Zoom Air and injected Phylon feels low and quick with no impact problems at all.
12720,299,293,8.0,2018-06-12,materials,"The material is soft and breaks-in easily. Overall, the material is not very premium, but for a budget model it gets the job done!"

12722,299,176,9.0,2018-06-12,materials,The form-fitting upper flexes in all the right ways but holds solid where it needs to.

12724,299,33,8.0,2018-08-08,support,Wide and flat base with a super smooth transition and great mid-foot support. I would have like a more pronounced lateral outrigger.

12740,300,33,9.0,2018-06-12,cushion,Semi-firm Phylon as well as Zoom Air in the heel and forefoot provide a pretty sweet ride.
12741,300,293,8.0,2018-04-17,cushion,The forefoot cushion is a bit mushier and less responsive than I would have liked. Heel cushion feels firmer and impact protection is great.

12770,301,613,8.4,2022-08-28,user_overall,It's a good shoe with ok traction ok cushion nice materials good suport and good fit
12771,301,72,6.0,2021-12-23,user_overall,This shoe is only for the biggest curry fans out there.
12772,301,293,8.0,2018-04-17,traction,Great on clean courts but the Curry 5 picks up dust like crazy. You have to wipe really hard to get off the dust too.
12773,301,522,8.0,2018-04-30,traction,"On dusty floors though, wiping wasn’t just necessary, it was REQUIRED."
12774,301,32,7.0,2018-06-12,traction,The traction was pretty decent but attracts a lot of dust.
12775,301,33,7.0,2018-04-17,traction,Traction is very inconsistent.
12776,301,6,6.5,2018-04-24,traction,Stay away from the Curry 5 if you play on dusty courts.
12777,301,221,6.0,2018-04-17,traction,This is the worst traction I have ever experienced in a Curry model. This is a real dust collector.
12778,301,45,7.0,2018-07-16,traction,"Traction is decent, but the rubber picks up a lot of dust, so you will need to wipe a lot."
12779,301,176,5.0,2018-04-17,traction,The Curry 5 picked up every bit of dust and took it home.
12780,301,293,7.0,2018-04-17,cushion,Cushioning is very minimal and responsive.
12781,301,522,7.0,2018-04-30,cushion,EVUA is back and is still boring like the Curry 4 set up although it feels slightly firmer and snoozier to me.
12782,301,32,8.0,2018-06-12,cushion,The cushioning is much more comfortable than the rock-hard Curry 4.
12783,301,33,7.0,2018-04-17,cushion,Cushioning is minimal.
12784,301,6,8.5,2018-04-24,cushion,Great court feel but very little impact protection.
12785,301,221,8.0,2018-04-17,cushion,I was pleasantly surprised by the cushioning setup. More impact protection and a little bit of bounce-back.
12786,301,45,6.0,2018-07-16,cushion,"The EVA cushioning provides very little impact protection and comfort. Only recommended, if you value court-feel and explosiveness above all else."
12787,301,176,7.0,2018-04-17,cushion,Dense EVA foam gives no real feel of impact protection or energy feedback.
12788,301,293,9.0,2018-04-17,materials,I love the materials!
12789,301,522,8.0,2018-04-30,materials,"Materials break in with play, but start out stiff."
12790,301,33,9.0,2018-04-17,materials,Anafoam is a great material.
12791,301,6,8.5,2018-04-24,materials,"The one-bootie knit upper feels very nice, the rest of the materials are pretty basic."
12792,301,221,7.0,2018-04-17,materials,The upper doesn't feel like Anafoam and wasn't very comfortable on the top of my feet.
12793,301,45,8.0,2018-07-16,materials,"The materials are light, flexible and feel great on foot."
12794,301,176,9.0,2018-04-17,materials,Anafoam is back and feels great!
12795,301,293,10.0,2018-04-17,support,"Wide base, and good lockdown."
12796,301,522,9.0,2018-04-30,support,Compared to the Curry 4 this shoe is slightly more stable with similar support.
12797,301,32,8.0,2018-06-12,support,"Slight heel slip,  but otherwise I felt stable and nicely locked down."
12798,301,33,9.0,2018-04-17,support,Support is good.
12799,301,6,8.5,2018-04-24,support,No side-to-side movement and the heel is locked in place.
12800,301,221,9.0,2018-04-17,support,I never felt like I was in danger of rolling my feet.
12801,301,45,6.0,2018-07-16,support,The upper support is very minimal - it almost seems as if this shoe was designed to be worn with an ankle brace.
12802,301,176,7.0,2018-04-17,support,Good midfoot support but the heel slip was terrible.
12803,301,293,10.0,2018-04-17,fit,The fit was very comfortable.
12804,301,522,8.0,2018-04-30,fit,"I had slight issues with heel slip, no movement or sliding in the forefoot."
12805,301,32,6.0,2018-06-12,fit,Fuse overlays on the medial side caused painful irritation and blisters - and I am not the only one having this poblem!
12806,301,33,5.0,2018-04-17,fit,The fit is horrendous. Painfully horrendous.
12807,301,6,5.0,2018-04-24,fit,The arch kept digging into my feet causing pain and blisters.
12808,301,221,5.0,2018-04-17,fit,I had terrible blisters on the medial side of my arch.
12809,301,45,8.0,2018-07-16,fit,Nice sock-like 1:1 fit.
12810,301,176,5.0,2018-04-17,fit,Anafoam is too soft to keep your heels locked in and the lacing system hurts if you lace it too tight.
12811,301,293,50.0,2018-04-17,outdoor,Outdoor use you should be okay because the rubber is hard and the traction pattern is deep.
12812,301,45,0.0,2018-07-16,outdoor,Shallow grooves and translucent rubber won't last long outdoors.
12813,301,522,3,2018-04-30,width,Regular and narrow footers can go true to size though.
12814,301,6,2,2018-04-24,width,If you have wide feet then the arch will dig into the medial side of your feet.
12815,301,45,2,2018-07-16,width,The width is narrow to regular.
12816,301,522,3,2018-04-30,size,"As a wide-footer, I found half a size up more comfortable."
12817,301,6,3,2018-04-24,size,Length-wise the Curry 5 runs true to size.
12818,301,45,3,2018-07-16,size,Go true to size.
12819,302,293,8.6,2018-05-04,expert_overall,This is a top-tier performer for a very affordable price. This is going to be on the list of shoes with the best traction!
12820,302,176,8.5,2018-04-17,expert_overall,Very good traction and perhaps the best Boost cushioning in a basketball sneaker. Make sure to go down half a size because the fit didn't work for me in my true size.
12821,302,32,8.5,2018-04-17,expert_overall,"Insane traction, responsive cushioning and a very affordable price. I actually prefer the Crazylight Boost over the more expensive Adidas Harden 2."
12822,302,522,8.2,2018-08-08,expert_overall,It's almost as if Adidas read my blog and fixed all the issues I had with the predecessor. Great shoe that almost any player will enjoy - especially at the affordable price!
12823,302,6,7.5,2018-04-17,expert_overall,"Amazing cushioning, good traction and solid materials -  this could have been a 9.0! But dead space in the toebox and excessive heel slippage killed the Crazy Light Boost 2018 for me."
12824,302,594,8.6,2021-11-28,user_overall,Weird fit. Otherwise a very good shoe overall.
12825,302,293,10.0,2018-05-04,traction,The traction is amazing!
12826,302,176,9.5,2018-04-17,traction,The Crazylight Boost 2018 had serious grip on every surface.
12827,302,32,10.0,2018-04-17,traction,This traction is insane! I had no problems even on mildly dusty courts.
12828,302,522,9.0,2018-08-08,traction,The nice pliable rubber with deep grooves takes a little to break-in but then it provides great grip. Well done Adidas!
12829,302,6,8.0,2018-04-17,traction,The traction performs very well on clean courts but you will need to wipe a lot on dusty courts.
12830,302,293,9.0,2018-05-04,cushion,You can't go wrong with Boost cushioning.
12831,302,176,10.0,2018-04-17,cushion,The Crazylight Boost 2018 may be the most cushion-y Boost we have seen in basketball.
12832,302,32,8.0,2018-04-17,cushion,"Very firm and responsive, not as spongy as the Crazy Explosive."
12833,302,522,8.0,2018-08-08,cushion,Boost cushioning provides a great blend of impact protection and court feel that most players will like.
12834,302,6,9.0,2018-04-17,cushion,Great court feel and responsiveness with decent impact protection - perfect for my playing style.
12835,302,293,8.0,2018-05-04,materials,The materials are very pliable and feel soft. I would have preferred them to be a little thinner though.
12836,302,176,7.0,2018-04-17,materials,The materials are very basic but comfortable on foot.
12837,302,32,8.0,2018-04-17,materials,"Soft and flexible, nothing spectacular but gets the job done."
12838,302,522,8.0,2018-08-08,materials,The stretchy mesh upper didn't let me down.
12839,302,6,8.0,2018-04-17,materials,Materials are not premium but they do their job.
12840,302,293,8.0,2018-05-04,support,"Lateral containment, lockdown, and support are very good. I had a tiny bit of heel slippage."
12841,302,176,9.0,2018-04-17,support,"Solid midfoot shank and good forefoot lockdown, but support suffered from heel slippage and movement of the feet."
12842,302,32,8.0,2018-04-17,support,"I had some slight heel slippage. Other than that, the CLB 2018 felt very stable and supportive."
12843,302,522,8.0,2018-08-08,support,Overall I had no issues with support and stability.
12844,302,6,7.0,2018-04-17,support,"Great forefoot lockdown, and stable base, but I experienced a lot of heel slippage. I felt like I could slide out of these shoes at all times."
12845,302,293,8.0,2018-05-04,fit,There is a little bit of dead space in the front.
12846,302,176,7.0,2018-04-17,fit,The shoe was very roomy and the simple lacing system did very little to hold my foot down.
12847,302,32,8.0,2018-04-17,fit,The Crazy Light Boost 2018 is very comfortable.
12848,302,522,8.0,2018-08-08,fit,Heel slip is improved compared to the CLB 2016 but still not perfect.
12849,302,6,8.0,2018-04-17,fit,I had a little bit of dead space in the toe box.
12850,302,293,100.0,2018-05-04,outdoor,Hard and thick rubber - outdoor use should be good!
12851,302,6,4,2018-04-17,width,A little bit wider than the CLB 2016.
12852,302,522,5,2018-08-08,size,These run long similar to the CLB 2016. If you don't have wide feet go down half a size.
12853,302,6,4,2018-04-17,size,Runs half a size long.
12854,303,176,9.5,2018-04-17,expert_overall,"It may be an opinion clouded in sentiment, but there is no denying it: the Protro is a great, great, great performer."
12855,303,33,9.4,2018-04-26,expert_overall,I miss shoes that are built like this. Nike reduced a bit of bulk from the original and created a shoe that I didn't want to take off again.
12856,303,6,9.0,2018-10-01,expert_overall,"At $175, I wouldn't really recommend the Kobe Protro for on-court use. This is a great performer, but there are cheaper shoes that perform just as well. If you are a big Kobe fan or you like the old school materials, then go ahead and buy these!"
12857,303,522,8.8,2018-08-08,expert_overall,The Kobe 1 Protro feels and plays like the OG which is a good thing! From traction to containment and balanced cushioning - it does everything right and gets a first-team rating from me!
12858,303,221,8.5,2018-04-30,expert_overall,"At the end of the day, the Kobe 1 Protro still feels like a throwback sneaker. The materials feel heavy and restrictive compared to current basketball shoe models."
12859,303,293,8.4,2018-04-30,expert_overall,"The Kobe 1 Protro is a decent big-man shoe. But for me, it was way too clunky and heavy. I feel like this is more of a lifestyle sneaker."
12860,303,729,8.9,2023-04-28,user_overall,"Leather upper very supportive but unbreathable. Too heavy and bulky shoe for shifty guards. But traction, air zoom cushioning, materials quality, support patterns is AMAZING. Slightly long shoe btw."
12861,303,222,8.2,2023-05-26,user_overall,"It’s pretty bulky, the cushion is stiff and the traction is nice but not top notch. Is really a beautiful shoe, but i wouldn’t consider it a great performer."
12862,303,552,10.0,2021-11-06,user_overall,"Just my kinda shoes, but it's heavy and not very breathable due to the material use, but loves it in terms of traction, cushion and kobe."
12863,303,651,7.8,2022-03-30,user_overall,
12864,303,176,10.0,2018-04-17,traction,The Kobe 1 Protro sticks like glue to any floor.
12865,303,33,9.5,2018-04-26,traction,It’s the tackiest of tractions it grips the court — any court — like nobody’s business.
12866,303,6,9.0,2018-10-01,traction,"Herringbone traction pattern always works. Whether I played on clean or dusty courts, I had no problems after a short break-in period."
12867,303,522,9.0,2018-08-08,traction,The traction takes a little to break in but Nike did an awesome job with this multi-directional herringbone pattern.
12868,303,221,8.0,2018-04-30,traction,The outsole isn't as tacky as I would have liked it to be.
12869,303,293,8.0,2018-04-30,traction,The traction wasn't as good as I hoped it would be.
12870,303,176,9.5,2018-04-17,cushion,"Nike Zoom Ari cushioning like it was originally designed to be: low, fast, speedy and responsive."
12871,303,33,9.5,2018-04-26,cushion,"The full-length Zoom Air here is low-to-the-ground, ultra responsive and has some nice feedback."
12872,303,6,9.5,2018-10-01,cushion,Full-length Zoom is my favorite cushioning setup and it feels amazing in the Kobe Protro.
12873,303,522,9.0,2018-08-08,cushion,"I thoroughly enjoyed the full-length Zoom cushioning which provides a great blend of fun, impact protection, and court feel."
12874,303,221,9.0,2018-04-30,cushion,"This is a very versatile cushioning setup which is very responsive, fast, with decent impact protection. Perfect for explosive wing players."
12875,303,293,9.0,2018-04-30,cushion,The cushioning feels very responsive and fast.
12876,303,176,9.5,2018-04-17,materials,"This is it: leather, suede, and leather, and more suede. Takes a while to break-in but then it feels great."
12877,303,33,10.0,2018-04-26,materials,I had forgotten just how nice leather is to play in!
12878,303,6,9.0,2018-10-01,materials,"Super-nice, old-school, real leather."
12879,303,522,8.0,2018-08-08,materials,The leather and suede are a little stiffer than the original and need some time to break in.
12880,303,293,9.0,2018-04-30,materials,The leather is very soft and feels great on foot.
12881,303,176,9.5,2018-04-17,support,"Wide base, large outrigger, lateral support from foam teeth on the lateral side of the midsole and the sturdy leather provide all the support you need."
12882,303,33,9.0,2018-04-26,support,Tthe forefoot stability is some of the best around — maybe even of all-time.
12883,303,6,8.5,2018-10-01,support,"I experienced slight heel slippage even when cranking down the laces. No side-to-side movement on the footbed, great torsional stability, and the lateral outriggers protect your ankles from rolling."
12884,303,522,9.0,2018-08-08,support,The ankle is very flexible and provides you with a wide range of motion but not a ton of support. The outsole is very wide and flat which helps to prevent ankle sprains.
12885,303,221,10.0,2018-04-30,support,"If you feel like basketball shoes are too flimsy these days, then you will enjoy the Kobe 1 Protro because the materials are tough enough for even the most explosive players."
12886,303,293,9.0,2018-04-30,support,Your feet are going nowhere in these shoes!
12887,303,176,9.0,2018-04-17,fit,"In the beginning, the shoe will feel bulky and disconnected because the leather takes a while to conform to your feet. Fit becomes much better after playing in the Kobe 1 Protro for a few days."
12888,303,33,9.0,2018-04-26,fit,Once the leather is broken-in the fit was great and almost provided the mobility of a low-cut.
12889,303,6,9.0,2018-10-01,fit,Hugs my feet nicely and the leather feels comfortable after breaking it in.
12890,303,522,9.0,2018-08-08,fit,No heel slip. No movement side to side. Well done Nike!
12891,303,221,7.0,2018-04-30,fit,"Even though I spent a ton of time trying to lace the Kobe 1 Proto as tight as possible, I didn't feel locked-in because the leather didn't conform to my feet."
12892,303,293,7.0,2018-04-30,fit,I felt the fit was bulky and cumbersome.
12893,303,293,100.0,2018-04-30,outdoor,Outdoor use should be good because of the hard and thick rubber.
12894,303,6,2,2018-10-01,width,Slightly narrow in the forefoot but loosens up over time.
12895,303,293,4,2018-04-30,width,The Kobe 1 Proto runs wide.
12896,303,6,3,2018-10-01,size,Runs true to size.
12897,303,522,4,2018-08-08,size,I went down half a size and they fit me just fine.
12898,303,293,3,2018-04-30,size,Runs true to size.
12899,304,615,9.5,2018-04-30,expert_overall,"Overall, the Kobe NXT 360 is the best Kobe shoe since the Kobe 9, in my opinion."
12900,304,293,9.4,2018-04-25,expert_overall,There is no other shoe I want to play in as much as these. Even though the traction of the translucent rubber is not the best this still might be the best basketball shoe we ever played in.
12901,304,6,9.2,2018-07-16,expert_overall,The Kobe AD NXT 360 is a great performer and looks amazing!
12902,304,45,8.8,2018-09-26,expert_overall,This is officially PureKicks best-rated shoe so far!
12903,304,33,8.6,2018-06-16,expert_overall,The Kobe NXT 360 is a true next-generation shoe and incredibly fun to play in!
12904,304,32,8.5,2018-04-24,expert_overall,"The traction is subpar, the 360 Flyknit concept is cool but nothing spectacular and the price is too expensive for what you get."
12905,304,221,8.4,2018-06-12,expert_overall,I absolutely loved playing in these shoes! The Kobe AD NXT 360 truly feels like a high-performance shoe with cutting-edge technology and will be in my rotation for a long time.
12906,304,522,8.4,2018-07-16,expert_overall,"So is the NXT 360 worth the price of admission? In a nutshell, no. The Mamba Instinct delivers similar performance, at a fraction of the price!"

12912,304,615,9.0,2018-04-30,traction,"The traction wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t the best either. Works well on clean courts but dusty courts are problematic."
12913,304,293,7.0,2018-04-25,traction,The translucent traction pattern attracted a lot of dust and required tough wiping. On clean courts the traction was good.
12914,304,6,9.5,2018-07-16,traction,The traction is phenomenal even on dustier courts!
12915,304,45,9.0,2018-09-26,traction,You don't have to worry about slipping or sliding at all.
12916,304,33,9.0,2018-06-16,traction,Traction on the Kobe NXT 360 started out phenomenally but has already lost some of its grip after 4 weeks of use.
12917,304,32,7.0,2018-04-24,traction,The traction doesn't grip the floor very well even after breaking them in.
12918,304,221,7.0,2018-06-12,traction,"The rubber compound isn't very sticky but did a decent job. On a dusty court you will need to wipe, but then you're good to go."
12919,304,522,8.0,2018-07-16,traction,Traction was a bit disappointing as It didn’t have the bite I was expecting on clean floors and picked up a decent amount of dust.
12920,304,615,10.0,2018-04-30,cushion,"The comfort is there, the impact protection is there, the court feel is there — the stuff is just amazing."
12921,304,293,10.0,2018-04-25,cushion,The best cushioning setup we have ever experienced. Nike just nailed it!
12922,304,6,9.0,2018-07-16,cushion,This is one of my favorite cushioning setups and comes really close to full-length Zoom.
12923,304,45,10.0,2018-09-26,cushion,The mixture of Nike React and Lunarlon feels absolutely incredible.
12924,304,33,9.0,2018-06-16,cushion,The mixed React and Lunarlon drop-in midsole provides a fluid ride with a lot of court-feel in the front and impact protection in the rear.
12925,304,32,8.0,2018-04-24,cushion,Nike Lunarlon combined with React cushioning is solid but I like more responsive cushioning like Nike Zoom Air.
12926,304,221,8.0,2018-06-12,cushion,"Very low to the ground, responsive and a ton of court feel. If you need a lot of impact protection - this is not for you."
12927,304,522,9.0,2018-07-16,cushion,"If you want low to the ground yet comfortable and balanced cushioning, then this is your set up."
12928,304,615,9.5,2018-04-30,materials,I'm almost speechless because the materials are so nice!
12929,304,293,10.0,2018-04-25,materials,"The upper is incredibly minimal, doesn't stretch and provides very good ventilation."
12930,304,6,9.5,2018-07-16,materials,"The pure 360 Flyknit in the rear feels amazing, the front is TPU reinforced to provide more lockdown and durability.  Being able to see through the upper is really cool and unique."
12931,304,45,9.0,2018-09-26,materials,The materials are probably the most comfortable I ever experienced in a basketball shoe.
12932,304,33,7.0,2018-06-16,materials,"360-degrees of Flyknit was hyped up quite a bit. It performs well, but it wasn’t anything spectacular."
12933,304,221,10.0,2018-06-12,materials,The extremely lightweight and flexible 360 Flyknit material is truly cutting edge and feels like an extension of your feet.
12934,304,522,8.0,2018-07-16,materials,TPU reinforced Flyknit is very breathable and comfortable.
12935,304,615,9.5,2018-04-30,support,The support comes mainly drom the drop-in midsole and is fantastic.
12936,304,293,10.0,2018-04-25,support,"No heel slippage, great containment, and lateral support."
12937,304,6,9.0,2018-07-16,support,"Zero heel slippage, no side-to-side movement. I just would have wished to get a lateral outrigger."
12938,304,45,8.0,2018-09-26,support,"The support is very, very good considering the minimal build of the upper."
12939,304,33,9.0,2018-06-16,support,For  $200 I would have liked a few more support features like an external outrigger or a mid-foot carbon fiber plate.
12940,304,32,8.0,2018-04-24,support,The support was surprisingly good considering the type of construction.
12941,304,221,8.0,2018-06-12,support,Stability is not an issue with the Kobe AD NXT 360!
12942,304,522,7.0,2018-07-16,support,"Support is fine for a low top with excellent heel fit and a decent heel counter. However, the rounded outsole with no outrigger is just asking me for an ankle sprain."
12943,304,615,9.5,2018-04-30,fit,Great lockdown and very good ventilation.
12944,304,293,10.0,2018-04-25,fit,This is the best fitting shoe I have ever worn!
12945,304,6,9.0,2018-07-16,fit,"Nice 1:1 fit, no complaints at all!"
12946,304,45,8.0,2018-09-26,fit,The fit of this shoe is very good.
12947,304,33,9.0,2018-06-16,fit,"Lockdown was surprisingly good, and if you get the right size, then this shoe feels like an extension of your foot!"
12948,304,221,9.0,2018-06-12,fit,The fit is awesome - I had a second skin experience!
12949,304,522,10.0,2018-07-16,fit,"Great heel lockdown, no dead space in the toe box, no side-to-side movement and the thin upper feels like a second skin. The fit is the highlight of the 360 -  no doubt!"
12950,304,293,0.0,2018-04-25,outdoor,Outdoor use is not recommended.
12951,304,6,0.0,2018-07-16,outdoor,The rubber is pretty soft and the pattern is too narrow for outdoor use.
12952,304,45,0.0,2018-09-26,outdoor,I would definitely not take these outdoors.
12953,304,293,2,2018-04-25,width,The width is pretty narrow.
12954,304,6,3,2018-07-16,width,I have slightly wide feet but the Kobe AD NXT 360 didn't bother me in my true size.
12955,304,45,3,2018-09-26,width,The shoe will conform to the shape of your feet and worked perfectly fine for my wide feet.
12956,304,293,4,2018-04-25,size,"They run long, go down half a size!"
12957,304,6,3,2018-07-16,size,"Go true to size, even if you have slightly wide feet."
12958,304,45,3,2018-09-26,size,True-to-size fit me perfectly well.
12959,304,522,4,2018-07-16,size,I went true to size with the 360 and it has a tiny bit of extra length in the toe but not enough to size down half a size.
12960,305,293,9.0,2018-06-12,expert_overall,The Lebron Soldier 12 is 100% worth its price! It's just nice to play in a shoe with gnarly traction like this!
12961,305,522,8.6,2018-09-26,expert_overall,"If you want a shoe that does everything very well, this is your shoe."
12962,305,45,7.4,2018-06-12,expert_overall,"The traction was surprisingly fantastic! The fit was brillitant, the support was good, if only the materials would have been better!"
12963,305,504,7.6,2022-01-05,user_overall,"The shoe was good indoors, for more of a big man in the paint than a PG or SG. However durability is terrible. After 2 months of playing indoors/outdoors the bubble in the midsole came out of the bottoms that's how much rubber came off..."

12966,305,293,10.0,2018-06-12,traction,"The traction is absolutely amazing, even on dusty courts!"
12967,305,522,9.0,2018-09-26,traction,The pliable rubber with a simple blade pattern just works on every surface with minimal wiping.
12968,305,45,9.0,2018-06-12,traction,The traction really bit the floor even on dusty courts!
12969,305,293,7.0,2018-06-12,cushion,"Bottom-loaded heel and forefoot Zoom in a firm Phylon midsole. Impact protection is decent, courtfeel is not great as you feel pretty high up."
12970,305,522,8.0,2018-09-26,cushion,"Overall, I’m happy with how the Soldier XII feels underfoot."
12971,305,45,8.0,2018-06-12,cushion,With forefoot Zoom and heel Zoom you are taken care off!
12972,305,293,9.0,2018-06-12,materials,"Neoprene-like material around the midfoot and canvas / leather depending on the colorway on the forefoot. It's not as premium as the Battleknit on the Lebron 15, but still really nice!"
12973,305,522,9.0,2018-09-26,materials,The synthetic leather feels very premium and the knit looks very similar to Battleknit.
12974,305,45,5.0,2018-06-12,materials,The straps weren't holding up - we had to restrap all the time which was pretty annoying. Also the ventilation was pretty bad.
12975,305,293,10.0,2018-06-12,support,"The straps of the Lebron 12 give you a very nice lockdown, no heel slippage or lateral movement."
12976,305,522,8.0,2018-09-26,support,Support is average with a pretty flexible sock like upper.
12977,305,45,7.0,2018-06-12,support,"Heel counter, outrigger, and nice lockdown are there. Feels like a low top, but the support is good."
12978,305,522,9.0,2018-09-26,fit,The fit is very good overall with the Soldier XII without any heel slip or wide to side movement and no dead space in the forefoot at all.
12979,305,45,8.0,2018-06-12,fit,Fits like an glove and requires minimal break-in.
12980,305,293,50.0,2018-06-12,outdoor,"You could get away with it, if you really want to."
12981,305,45,100.0,2018-06-12,outdoor,"Hard rubber, deep grooves - what more do you want?"
12982,305,522,3,2018-09-26,size,True to size.
12983,305,45,3,2018-06-12,size,Go true to size.
12984,306,293,8.2,2018-03-25,expert_overall,This is by far the cheapest signature model on the market but it's still a very good performer. We enjoyed it a lot!
12985,306,32,7.5,2018-04-24,expert_overall,"Considering that the Kyrie Flytrap is a budget model it gets the job done, but it's nothing spectacular. Save some extra money and get the Kyrie 4."
12986,306,33,7.4,2018-04-17,expert_overall,"Not a bad shoe for $80, but I would opt for discounted Kyrie 4s — unless you happen to have a wide foot."
12987,306,649,6.8,2018-03-25,expert_overall,I can't recommend the Kyrie Flytrap from a performance standpoint. The Flytrap feels so cheap that it doesn’t even feel like it was made by Nike.
12988,306,615,6.7,2018-03-25,expert_overall,Is it worth your $80 bucks? I don’t think so.
12989,306,729,7.2,2023-04-28,user_overall,"If you are a looking cheap outdoor shoe, flytrap series good option for you. Good for shifty guards who dont need cushion. But materials and fit line is so bad."
12990,306,733,8.0,2022-12-29,user_overall,"Good shoe to play in especially outdoors. It's mainly for guards, it focuses on response than impact protection"
12991,306,686,7.8,2022-02-22,user_overall,Great for wide footers and this is the only shoe that the traction got worse each time i played in it.
12992,306,233,7.4,2023-12-28,user_overall,
12993,306,651,7.8,2021-11-29,user_overall,
12994,306,293,9.0,2018-03-25,traction,Awesome stopping power and dust wasn't a big problem because of the wide traction pattern.
12995,306,32,8.0,2018-04-24,traction,"The traction is very good on lateral moves, but I had problems with the straight-line stopping power."
12996,306,33,7.0,2018-04-17,traction,"Works well on well-maintained courts, but I had problems on old and dusty courts."
12997,306,649,8.0,2018-03-25,traction,The traction is the best aspect of the Kyrie Flytrap and comes very close to the original Kyrie 4.
12998,306,615,9.5,2018-03-25,traction,The traction on the Kyrie Flytrap is excellent
12999,306,293,7.0,2018-03-25,cushion,The Phylon cushioning isn't great but a lot softer than the extremely hard cushioning of the Kyrie 2 and 3.
13000,306,33,7.0,2018-04-17,cushion,The cushion in the Nike Kyrie Flytrap is about as minimal as it gets.
13001,306,649,6.0,2018-03-25,cushion,The Zoom bag found here is comically small and provides very little impact protection. The wafer-thin Phylon insole doesn't help much either.
13002,306,615,7.0,2018-03-25,cushion,The Phylon cushion setup isn't horrible.
13003,306,293,9.0,2018-03-25,materials,"The material is super thin, very comfortable, and doesn't require any break-in period."
13004,306,32,8.0,2018-04-24,materials,The basic materials feel light and comfortable and get the job done.
13005,306,33,9.0,2018-04-17,materials,I was pleasantly surprised by the thin woven material used on the upper material.
13006,306,615,7.0,2018-03-25,materials,The mesh-like knit provides a lot of support and containment.
13007,306,293,8.0,2018-03-25,support,"There were no issues with support, lockdown, and stability."
13008,306,32,7.0,2018-04-24,support,"I am not a big fan of the burrito style tongue, but lockdown and support are still decent."
13009,306,33,7.0,2018-04-17,support,The support in the shoe is adequate overall.
13010,306,649,7.0,2018-03-25,support,"The Flytrap’s ankle support isn’t necessarily bad, just not very comfortable or confidence-inspiring."
13011,306,615,5.0,2018-03-25,support,The support was slightly below OK.
13012,306,293,8.0,2018-03-25,fit,The fit of this shoe was off in our regular sizes. Think about going down at least half a size.
13013,306,33,7.0,2018-04-17,fit,The fit didn't work very well for me because of my narrow feet.
13014,306,649,6.0,2018-03-25,fit,I had to wear a second pair of socks to fill the dead space in the forefoot.
13015,306,615,5.0,2018-03-25,fit,Everything about the fit for me was weird.
13016,306,293,100.0,2018-03-25,outdoor,The rubber is pretty hard and should be very good outdoors!
13017,307,33,9.0,2018-04-25,expert_overall,The Lebron 15 Low fixes the issues of the mid version with stability and support on lateral movements. This is a shoe that will for everyone.
13018,307,176,8.7,2018-06-12,expert_overall,The Lebron 15 Low is a vast improvement over last year's Lows. It's a little more guard-oriented with less cushioning and better stability and traction during lateral cuts. It also works well for lighter players that didn't like the bulky High-top version of the Lebron 15.
13019,307,293,8.4,2018-04-25,expert_overall,"I am not a big fan of the Lebron 15 Low. Expensive, heavier than most Lows and the high ride won't work for quick guards who rely on lateral cuts."

13021,307,456,8.6,2022-01-15,user_overall,
13022,307,33,9.0,2018-04-25,traction,I’d say this was a slight improvement over the mid version.
13023,307,176,9.0,2018-06-12,traction,The traction pattern from the original Lebron 15 has been turned by 30 degrees which makes it much better when moving laterally.
13024,307,293,8.0,2018-04-25,traction,The traction works well and requires little wiping.
13025,307,33,9.0,2018-04-25,cushion,Air Max in the heel and traditional forefoot Zoom Air created a very fluid ride with a bit of spring to each step.
13026,307,176,7.0,2018-06-12,cushion,"Lower ride, very responsive but less springy and not as much impact protection as the High."
13027,307,293,8.0,2018-04-25,cushion,Great impact protection but responsiveness could be better. You feel very high up which hurt stability a little.
13028,307,33,9.0,2018-04-25,materials,Battleknit is a wonderful upper that fits and feels great on-foot.
13029,307,176,9.0,2018-06-12,materials,Battleknit is soft in all the right spots and the ankle and tongue tab are made of a very nice synthetic leather.
13030,307,293,9.0,2018-04-25,materials,Battleknit is super comfortable and durable.
13031,307,33,9.0,2018-04-25,support,A much bigger outrigger provides the stability that was missing from the mid version.
13032,307,176,9.5,2018-06-12,support,The support has improved a lot with a lower ride and the addition of an outrigger.
13033,307,293,7.0,2018-04-25,support,High ride and small outrigger made me feel a bit unstable.
13034,307,33,9.0,2018-04-25,fit,I’m happy to say that the fit gave me no problems at all.
13035,307,176,9.0,2018-06-12,fit,My feet didn't move inside the shoe and heel lockdown was fantastic for a low.
13036,307,293,10.0,2018-04-25,fit,The fit is very nice!
13037,307,293,0.0,2018-04-25,outdoor,Outdoor use is not recommended.
13038,307,293,2,2018-04-25,width,Narrower than most Lebrons.
13039,307,293,4,2018-04-25,size,Go down half a size if you have narrow feet.
13040,308,33,9.0,2018-02-26,expert_overall,The PG 2 is a really fun shoe to play because it enhanced nearly every feature found on the PG 1.
13041,308,32,9.0,2018-03-04,expert_overall,"The PG2 has slightly improved in every aspect: better cushioning, nicer materials, more comfortable fit and slightly improved traction make them a contender for best shoe of 2018."
13042,308,615,9.0,2018-03-25,expert_overall,The Nike PG 2 is a well-rounded shoe and great for people all shapes and sizes. I’d say its definitely an upgrade from the PG 1.
13043,308,176,9.0,2018-03-25,expert_overall,The PG2 is honestly the best all-around shoe that Nike has on the market right now (especially at $110).
13044,308,6,8.6,2018-02-26,expert_overall,The PG2 performs well across all aspects and comes at an extremely fair price.
13045,308,221,8.6,2018-03-25,expert_overall,The Nike PG2 is a slight improvement over the PG1 and in the competition for the best bang-for-the-buck basketball shoe on the market.
13046,308,522,8.4,2018-03-25,expert_overall,"The Nike PG2 is all any player would need, everything about it is solid."
13047,308,649,8.3,2018-08-08,expert_overall,"Lockdown and fit have been greatly improved, the cushioning offers exceptional response after a break-in period and $110 remains a great deal! Unfortunately, the shoe still isn't the most comfortable and traction has taken a small step backward."
13048,308,293,8.2,2018-03-04,expert_overall,"At this price point, you will have a hard time finding another shoe of this quality."
13049,308,45,8.0,2018-03-25,expert_overall,This shoe is an absolute steal! I especially loved the incredible fit and traction.
13050,308,735,9.6,2022-11-16,user_overall,Overall fit is great which really gave ton of support for my foot. Cushion is stiff and lacking on heel comfort but super responsive and amazing court feel. Durability is pretty excellect due to foam type and suede materials which gave premium and old school aesthetics. Traction does have a good bite although durability of the outsole is my major concern. It really burns quickly the traction pattern of the shoe.   I think the shoe is perfect for players with smooth style of play like PG himself.

13055,308,33,9.0,2018-02-26,traction,The aggressive pattern is multidirectional and works well under pressure - even on dusty courts.
13056,308,32,9.0,2018-03-04,traction,The traction is awesome!
13057,308,615,9.0,2018-03-25,traction,"Overall, I give the PG 2’s traction a solid thumbs up."
13058,308,176,9.0,2018-03-25,traction,This translucent colorway attracts a lot of dust but works very well on clean courts.
13059,308,6,9.0,2018-02-26,traction,I had no problems at all - even on dustier courts.
13060,308,221,9.0,2018-03-25,traction,The traction was excellent no matter the court.
13061,308,522,9.0,2018-03-25,traction,Thin and pliable rubber on a multi-directional pattern is always a good sign.
13062,308,649,7.0,2018-08-08,traction,The traction of the PG2 required regular swiping and never provided the reassuring squeak I am looking for.
13063,308,293,8.0,2018-03-04,traction,"The bite is not very aggressive, but even on dust, you will never slide out."
13064,308,45,8.0,2018-03-25,traction,The solid traction pattern worked well on clean and dusty courts. The translucent traction pattern started to wear-off quickly.
13065,308,33,9.0,2018-02-26,cushion,"Lightweight Phylon and 10mm Zoom air unit in the forefoot feels light, stable, and supportive."
13066,308,32,9.0,2018-03-04,cushion,Forefoot Zoom unit feels bouncier and plusher compared to the PG1.
13067,308,615,9.0,2018-03-25,cushion,Cushion quickly became my favorite part of the shoe .
13068,308,176,9.0,2018-03-25,cushion,The top loaded Zoom unit makes the forefoot area of the PG2 bouncy and responsive without feeling unstable.
13069,308,6,8.0,2018-02-26,cushion,The cushioning feels a little more forgiving compared to the PG1. The impact protection could be a little better.
13070,308,221,9.0,2018-03-25,cushion,I love how the top-loaded 10mm Zoom bags feel.
13071,308,522,8.0,2018-03-25,cushion,"Overall, cushioning feels good, softer than the PG1 with a little more fun in the forefoot."
13072,308,649,9.0,2018-08-08,cushion,The balance between cushioning and court feel is exceptional after a rather lengthy break-in period.
13073,308,293,6.0,2018-03-04,cushion,This ride is rough.
13074,308,45,8.0,2018-03-25,cushion,The thick forefoot Zoom feels incredible. There is very little cushioning in the heel.
13075,308,33,9.0,2018-02-26,materials,Durable. Flexible. Comfortable. All-in-one.
13076,308,615,9.0,2018-03-25,materials,The mesh upper with some suede panels makes for a good combination.
13077,308,176,9.0,2018-03-25,materials,Ballistic-style mesh with a nice touch of suede does its job.
13078,308,6,8.0,2018-02-26,materials,Soft mesh enforced with suede and nubuck.
13079,308,221,8.0,2018-03-25,materials,"Nice mix of suede, neoprene, and mesh."
13080,308,522,8.0,2018-03-25,materials,The materials on the PG2 are flexible and strong and require no break-in
13081,308,293,9.0,2018-03-04,materials,Materials are astonishingly nice.
13082,308,45,8.0,2018-03-25,materials,"At $110, the materials perform very well!"
13083,308,33,9.0,2018-02-26,support,"The support isn’t anything extravagant, but I felt safe and stable at all times."
13084,308,32,9.0,2018-03-04,support,Forefoot wing-straps and outrigger provide great lockdown and lateral containment.
13085,308,615,9.0,2018-03-25,support,The overall support was solid.
13086,308,176,9.0,2018-03-25,support,"Wide base, stable foam, locked-in forefoot — that's everything you need for a solid support shoe."
13087,308,6,9.0,2018-02-26,support,Zero lateral movement issues and great lockdown in the heel.
13088,308,221,8.0,2018-03-25,support,All the standard support features are there.
13089,308,522,8.0,2018-03-25,support,"Stability is very good thanks to a low-to-the-ground ride, flat outsole, and forefoot outrigger"
13090,308,649,8.0,2018-08-08,support,I would have preferred a little more padding around the ankle to improve heel lockdown. But when you lace the PG2 tightly enough you will feel secure and safe.
13091,308,293,9.0,2018-03-04,support,"Sturdy materials, really good lateral containment, pronounced outrigger and great lockdown."
13092,308,45,7.0,2018-03-25,support,I liked the forefoot lockdown but there was a little bit of heel slippage.
13093,308,33,9.0,2018-02-26,fit,Lockdown is a standout feature of the PG 2
13094,308,615,9.0,2018-03-25,fit,Lockdown is great and the shoe is versatile enough to accomodate different foot shapes.
13095,308,176,9.0,2018-03-25,fit,Nice lockdown in the forefoot but I had a little more dead space in the ankle collar than I like.
13096,308,6,9.0,2018-02-26,fit,Overall the fit was very nice.
13097,308,221,9.0,2018-03-25,fit,The two straps work very well and the shoes broke in very nicely!
13098,308,522,9.0,2018-03-25,fit,I had no heel slip and no movement side to side.
13099,308,649,9.0,2018-08-08,fit,"The fit is much improved compared to the PG1. Forefoot lockdown is second to none, the heel isn't bad either."
13100,308,293,9.0,2018-03-04,fit,The PG2 is easy to get on and super comfortable.
13101,308,45,9.0,2018-03-25,fit,The fit of the PG2 is sensational!
13102,308,293,0.0,2018-03-04,outdoor,The Nike PG2 won't hold up very long outdoors because of the soft and pliable rubber.
13103,308,45,50.0,2018-03-25,outdoor,"Don't use the translucent colorway outdoors, but the solid colorway should work decently."
13104,308,6,1,2018-02-26,width,Very narrow.
13105,308,522,2,2018-03-25,width,The PG2 started off a little tight for me but loosened up with play.
13106,308,293,2,2018-03-04,width,The PG2 fits pretty narrow.
13107,308,6,3,2018-02-26,size,They run pretty true to size.
13108,308,522,3,2018-03-25,size,True to size
13109,308,293,3,2018-03-04,size,True to size.
13110,309,293,9.2,2018-03-04,expert_overall,We really enjoyed playing in these. The Harden Vol. 2 should work well for everyone - responsive enough for guards but the support and comfortable cushioning will work well for bigger guys too!
13111,309,33,8.8,2018-03-04,expert_overall,"Overall a great shoe, but unfortunately, the inconsistency that I experienced with the traction will likely keep the Harden Vol 2 out of my rotation."
13112,309,522,8.8,2018-03-04,expert_overall,The Harden Vol2 is extremely fun to wear! Overall I feel that Adidas improved everything compared to the V1.
13113,309,615,8.7,2018-03-04,expert_overall,Unless you play on crispy clean courts I wouldn't recommend the Harden Vol 2 because there are a bunch of better options on the market.
13114,309,221,8.6,2018-06-12,expert_overall,The Harden 2 will defintely stay in my gym bag for a while! I especially loved the comfortable materials and the Boost cushioning. Everything about this sneaker just worked for me - and they are just flat out fun to play in!
13115,309,6,8.5,2018-02-26,expert_overall,Overall the Harden Vol. 2 is a great performer. Some nitpicking: I would have liked the heel to be a little less clunky and the Boost cushioning to be a little softer in the forefoot.
13116,309,32,8.0,2018-03-25,expert_overall,"Overall, this shoe is pretty good. Great shoe if you have bad knees, you need a lot of comfort and impact protection and you can live with the lackluster traction."
13117,309,45,7.8,2018-02-26,expert_overall,"Amazing cushioning, very nice materials and support. Traction is solid but I wasn't happy with the fit."
13118,309,456,8.5,2022-01-13,user_overall,"I’ll keep this short, the only thing that held back the Harden Vol. 2 was the weight… and the inconsistent traction ;)"

13122,309,293,9.0,2018-03-04,traction,Traction needs a little break in time but stopping power is great on clean courts. Attracts a lot of dust though.
13123,309,33,7.0,2018-03-04,traction,"Unfortunately, the traction on the Harden Vol 2 just wasn’t as good as that of the original."
13124,309,522,8.0,2018-03-04,traction,"Traction is ridiculously good on clean floors, but you need to wipe a lot on dusty courts."
13125,309,615,7.0,2018-03-04,traction,"On a clean court, the traction was solid, but the Harden Vol 2 collects dust like nobody's business."
13126,309,221,8.0,2018-06-12,traction,"I thought the traction was pretty solid. You will have to wipe every now and then but then you get good traction. To be safe, get a colorway with a white outsole, as players with a black or grey outsole reported more problems with the traction than others."
13127,309,6,9.0,2018-02-26,traction,"This traction pattern performs very well. I usually play on really dust courts, but as long as you wipe, you will not have any problems."
13128,309,32,6.0,2018-03-25,traction,The traction was pretty disappointing and just didn't grip the floor. Don't even bother on a dusty court.
13129,309,45,7.0,2018-02-26,traction,"On a clean court the traction is great, but unfortunately, the rubber is a real dust collector."
13130,309,293,10.0,2018-03-04,cushion,This Boost cushioning setup is really nice. Very comfortable but still remains responsive and provides good court feel.
13131,309,33,9.5,2018-03-04,cushion,Boost cushioning works really well.
13132,309,522,9.0,2018-03-04,cushion,Firm Boost setup is a nice blend of speed and impact protection.
13133,309,615,9.5,2018-03-04,cushion,Thick Boost cushioning does a great job with impact protection.
13134,309,221,9.0,2018-06-12,cushion,Full length boost provides a ton of bounce and impact protection as well as a surprising amount of responsiveness. This is the best and most versatile Boost experience on the hardwood!
13135,309,6,9.0,2018-02-26,cushion,A lot of impact protection in the heel but very responsive in the forefoot.
13136,309,32,9.0,2018-03-25,cushion,"This shoe is very, very comfy due to the huge amount of Boost. Court feel and responsiveness could be better."
13137,309,45,10.0,2018-02-26,cushion,The Boost cushioning is incredible. I don't know how you could hate on that!
13138,309,293,9.0,2018-03-04,materials,The materials are soft and pliable.
13139,309,33,9.0,2018-03-04,materials,Materials aren't premium but perform very well.
13140,309,522,9.0,2018-03-04,materials,Sure it isn’t Primeknit but it looks premium with all that texture and color and performs just as well.
13141,309,615,9.0,2018-03-04,materials,Materials are pretty basic but perform well.
13142,309,221,9.0,2018-06-12,materials,Zero break-in time!
13143,309,6,8.0,2018-02-26,materials,"The forged fiber, textile, and mesh are pretty nice."
13144,309,32,8.0,2018-03-25,materials,"The mesh in the forefoot feels really nice, the synthetic panel on the back works well."
13145,309,45,8.0,2018-02-26,materials,Materials are not flashy but perform very well.
13146,309,293,9.0,2018-03-04,support,"Very supportive - great lockdown, wide base and super strong materials."
13147,309,33,9.5,2018-03-04,support,"For a Guard shoe, the support is here and shouldn’t let you down."
13148,309,522,9.0,2018-03-04,support,I really enjoyed the wide outsole and never felt in danger or turning my ankle at all.
13149,309,615,9.0,2018-03-04,support,"Wide base, strong mesh, and adjustable lacing system provide pretty good support."
13150,309,221,8.0,2018-06-12,support,I had no complaints when it came to support.
13151,309,6,8.0,2018-02-26,support,"I had no side-to-side movement, but a little heel slippage in the beginning which was fixed by playing with the adjustable lacing system."
13152,309,32,9.0,2018-03-25,support,This shoe gives really good support and the customizable lacing system gives you a lot of options to adapt the lockdown to your preferences.
13153,309,45,8.0,2018-02-26,support,"Internal heel counter, adaptive lacing system, lateral outrigger and great fit of the bootie setup do a very nice job!"
13154,309,293,9.0,2018-03-04,fit,"Great lockdown in the forefoot and lateral containment, but I would have liked the heel to be a little higher to avoid heel slippage."
13155,309,33,9.0,2018-03-04,fit,I love how it fits and feels.
13156,309,522,9.0,2018-03-04,fit,"The heel needs a little break in, otherwise, the shoe fits nicely out of the box."
13157,309,615,9.0,2018-03-04,fit,The one-piece bootie feels great on foot.
13158,309,221,9.0,2018-06-12,fit,The lockdown is absolutely amazing and the lacing system is almost too good!
13159,309,32,9.0,2018-03-25,fit,I had no problems with heel slippage or lateral containment. The bootie construction fit me very well.
13160,309,45,6.0,2018-02-26,fit,"Adjustable lacing system provides great lockdown. But there is an elastic band that separates the forefoot from the backfoot, which was really uncomfortable in the beginning."
13161,309,293,50.0,2018-03-04,outdoor,Outdoor use should be okay as the rubber is pretty hard.
13162,309,45,50.0,2018-02-26,outdoor,Outdoors you will be okay - just not for a very long time.
13163,309,522,2,2018-03-04,width,Wide footers like myself will want to go true to size because these run snug true to size.
13164,309,6,3,2018-02-26,width,I have slightly wide feet but these fit me perfectly.
13165,309,522,4,2018-03-04,size,Per usual Adidas runs slightly long but it’s shorter than the V1.
13166,309,6,3,2018-02-26,size,"Unlike other Adidas shoes, these fit me well going true to size."
13167,310,293,9.8,2018-11-26,expert_overall,I really like everything about the Adidas Crazy BYW X. The performance is great and should work well for players of all positions.
13168,310,33,8.7,2018-11-26,expert_overall,"I think the Crazy BYW X is very good, but the traction definitely could be better."
13169,310,221,7.8,2018-11-26,expert_overall,"Overall, the performance of the Adidas BYW X is solid. But the uneven ride and the lacking outsole durability are no-gos considering the hefty price tag."

13173,310,293,9.0,2018-11-26,traction,Traction worked really well on clean courts but you need to wipe from time to time on dusty courts.
13174,310,33,7.0,2018-11-26,traction,"Traction was amazing…to start. Unfortunately, the traction got worse with every session and need a lot of wiping now."
13175,310,221,8.0,2018-11-26,traction,The tight traction pattern in the forefoot works well on clean courts but picks up a lot of dust. The rubber in the heel is very soft and started to fray quickly.
13176,310,293,10.0,2018-11-26,cushion,Cushioning feels really soft but remains responsive in the forefoot.
13177,310,33,9.0,2018-11-26,cushion,"The uncaged Boost in the heel is really bouncy, the caged Boost in the forefoot is more responsive and feels low-to-the-ground."
13178,310,221,8.0,2018-11-26,cushion,"The fully-caged Boost in the forefoot feels firm, low-to-the-ground, and really responsive. I felt a little unbalanced because the heel sits a lot higher than the forefoot and is a lot softer. Overall, I am not a big fan of this combination."
13179,310,293,10.0,2018-11-26,materials,The materials are super-super premium.
13180,310,33,9.0,2018-11-26,materials,Materials featured are pretty average for a modern shoe.
13181,310,221,9.0,2018-11-26,materials,"Comfortable PrimeKnit in the collar, the rest of the upper is made from a dual-layer mesh that looks and feels like a woven material. Overall, the materials are soft, flexible and deliver an old-school style with some new-school flavor."
13182,310,293,10.0,2018-11-26,support,The lockdown and support are really nice.
13183,310,33,9.0,2018-11-26,support,The support was really surprising on the Crazy BYW X.
13184,310,221,7.0,2018-11-26,support,"The heel counter works very well, but I didn't feel securely locked down by the lacing system or the upper material in the front."
13185,310,293,10.0,2018-11-26,fit,The fit of the shoes is really nice - they really feel like an extension of your feet.
13186,310,33,9.5,2018-11-26,fit,"After the break-in period, you will experience a form-fitting shoe like nothing you’ve ever felt before."
13187,310,221,7.0,2018-11-26,fit,The lace pressure in the Primeknit collar area was uncomfortable for my wide feet. I also experienced some dead space in the forefoot.
13188,311,293,9.4,2018-01-23,expert_overall,The full-length zoom setup is worth the $125 alone. A great big-man shoe as the cushion is amazing!
13189,311,615,9.4,2018-01-29,expert_overall,"I didn’t expect the shoe to perform this well, but damn! Solid traction, great cushioning, great fit and lockdown, support was on point."

13193,311,522,8.6,2018-02-26,expert_overall,The Why Not Zero.1 is a very nice start for Westbrook’s signature line from a performance standpoint.
13194,311,739,8.1,2018-10-08,expert_overall,"I really enjoyed the full-length cushioning, and the support and lockdown. Overall, I'd wish this shoe was a little less bulky."
13195,311,6,8.0,2018-01-21,expert_overall,"The cushion is great, but the lacking traction and the uncomfortable strap hold back what could have been a top performer.  I am a bit disappointed by Russel Westbrooks first signature sneaker."

13204,311,33,9.0,2018-01-29,traction,If you hoop indoors then you should be very satisfied.
13205,311,176,9.0,2018-01-24,traction,"When clean and the court is workable, you’re straight Gorilla Glue."
13206,311,32,8.0,2018-01-23,traction,Traction is inconsistent depending on the floor. Works well on clean courts but on dusty courts you need to wipe a lot.

13211,311,293,10.0,2018-01-23,cushion,This is the best cushioning setup out there!
13212,311,615,10.0,2018-01-29,cushion,This full-length Zoom setup felt absolutely perfect.
13213,311,33,9.0,2018-01-29,cushion,This setup felt awesome — especially in the forefoot.
13214,311,176,9.5,2018-01-24,cushion,You get a responsive rocket ride that is low enough for quick guards and won’t hurt when you land.
13215,311,32,10.0,2018-01-23,cushion,"Full-length zoom is my favourite cushioning setup. This shoe is super explosive, responsive and comfortable."
13216,311,522,8.0,2018-02-26,cushion,Bottom-loaded Zoom under a big junk of Phylon. I like the quick setup but it would be a lot more fun if they felt Zoomier underfoot.
13217,311,739,9.0,2018-10-08,cushion,The full-length Zoom cushioning is the best feature of the shoe.

13225,311,522,8.0,2018-02-26,materials,Mesh and fuse are the primary materials on the Why Not and it works fine
13226,311,739,8.0,2018-10-08,materials,The mesh and fuse upper materials take a while to break-in but feel very durable and supportive.

13231,311,33,9.5,2018-01-29,support,"The wide flat base promotes a ton of stability, while the bulky midsole acts as one of the gnarliest outriggers of all-time."
13232,311,176,10.0,2018-01-24,support,Huge heel counter and outrigger provide phenomenal support without being clunky.
13233,311,32,9.0,2018-01-23,support,"Great lockdown, secure lacing system, and a massive outrigger provide great support."
13234,311,522,9.0,2018-02-26,support,Support and stability are outstanding!

13238,311,615,9.5,2018-01-29,fit,The moment your foot slides into the shoe the fit just grabs you and locks you in.
13239,311,33,10.0,2018-01-29,fit,The fit is fan-freaking-tastic.
13240,311,176,10.0,2018-01-24,fit,"Once your foot is in the shoe, there is no movement at all. NONE."
13241,311,32,9.0,2018-01-23,fit,"Overall, the shoe is very comfortable. The lace-lock was a little uncomfortable, but you can take it off without compromising performance."
13242,311,522,9.0,2018-02-26,fit,Overall the fit was great right out of the box aside from some lacelock pain.
13243,311,739,8.0,2018-10-08,fit,I had problems finding the right size because of the very snug feeling.
13244,311,6,7.0,2018-01-21,fit,The strap made this shoe very painful to play in and the sizing is a bit strange.
13245,311,45,7.0,2018-03-25,fit,"I the beginning, the one-bootie upper is really hard to get in."
13246,311,293,0.0,2018-01-23,outdoor,I would definitely not recommend outdoor use.
13247,311,45,50.0,2018-03-25,outdoor,You could probably take these outdoors for a while
13248,311,522,3,2018-02-26,width,True to size for everyone except maybe narrow footers.
13249,311,6,2,2018-01-21,width,The shoe fits really snug.
13250,311,522,4,2018-02-26,size,There is a teeny tiny bit of extra length but not enough for me to size down.
13251,311,6,4,2018-01-21,size,The shoe runs a little long.
13252,312,6,9.1,2017-12-29,expert_overall,"At $120, the Kyrie 4 is an absolute steal! This is a very well constructed shoe and an absolute beast on the court. Probably my favorite shoe to play in right now!"
13253,312,33,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, the Nike Kyrie 4 is Nike’s best performer this year. There’s just enough cushion for most, solid traction, fantastic fit and adequate support — and all of comes at a “team” friendly price point of $120."
13254,312,615,9.0,2018-01-14,expert_overall,The Kyrie 4 is the best Kyrie to date. This shoe has everything and is Nike’s best all-around hooping kick right now.
13255,312,45,9.0,2018-01-21,expert_overall,This is the best Kyrie signature shoe ever. The traction is amazing and the cushion and materials are vastly improved.
13256,312,86,9.0,2018-02-26,expert_overall,The Kyrie 4 is one of Nike’s best-performing signature shoes that works well at all positions.
13257,312,293,8.6,2018-01-05,expert_overall,"The Kyrie 4 is a phenomenal addition to the Kyrie line. It comes with improved cushioning and materials, great fit and support. The traction is a little disappointing, but for $120 these are a great pickup!"
13258,312,32,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,Definitely the best shoe in the Kyrie signature line so far. Perfect for quick guards who don't rely a lot on impact protection.
13259,312,221,8.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I had a lot of fun in the Kyrie 4! I give them a B+ - it's not quite elite, but almost there. However, at a $120 price these offer great value!"
13260,312,522,8.4,2018-01-05,expert_overall,"All in all, the Kyrie 4 is a solid shoe that does everything fairly well, while doing nothing outstanding or really poorly. Cushioning has improved, the traction is decent overall and I really liked the comfort of the plush interior."
13261,312,486,8.3,2018-01-29,expert_overall,"Overall, I am satisfied with the Kyrie 4. Minimal break-in time, great traction and a fair price. The Kyrie 4 gets the job done!"
13262,312,497,8.6,2022-01-13,user_overall,"The Nike Kyrie 4 is a nice shoe for guards. It is a reliable low to the ground shoe. The traction was pretty good on a clean court, but it slipped a little on dust. The traction was still pretty good tho, so you should be fine. The cushion isn’t too bad, but it’s nothing special either. It is responsive and has amazing court feel. The support was pretty good, and the rounded outsole helped with stability, so that you dont roll your ankle easily. The upper wasn’t the best, but it was pretty good!"
13263,312,560,9.5,2023-12-22,user_overall,"I played in a single pair of Kyrie 4s all through high school. The materials feel amazing and the shoes are still holding to this day, almost 2 years removed from those days. I tie my laces extremely tight, and when other shoes would show wear by stretching and popping, the Kyries would stand strong. They’re solid when you need them to be and versatile otherwise. My only complaint is that any amount of dust on the traction surface would lead to lots of slipping. They do have a roomy toebox."
13264,312,478,8.8,2022-02-23,user_overall,"This is one of the first good shoes i played with. The traction was decent but sometimes i would slip some. Cushion is great and much better than previous kyrie models. The stability was amazing and i didn't have any problems with heel slip or containment. The ventilation is not great though as the shoe can get pretty hit for me, although i don't mind it much. Overall i think this is great for shifty players but it also has good stability for big men, aesthetically this is my favorite model."
13265,312,361,8.6,2022-01-23,user_overall,"The Kyrie 4 is pretty similar to the Kyrie 3, but a WHOLE lot comfier! I absolutely LOVED the Cushlon midsole, it provided a perfect amount of both cushion and response! The traction is a bit of a downgrade from the 3, but still pretty dang good for me. Overall I highly recommended this shoe for all positions!"
13266,312,601,9.0,2023-05-20,user_overall,One of my favorite juries I’ve had. Played some of my best ball in them. Love the kyrie ones and these the most. Might get another pair sometime my other ones are beat after a year or two in them
13267,312,6,9.0,2017-12-29,traction,"Overall, the traction of the solid colorway is nice and requires minimal wiping."
13268,312,33,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,This multi-directional herringbone traction pattern worked really nicely.
13269,312,615,9.0,2018-01-14,traction,The traction did a great job after it broke in.
13270,312,45,9.0,2018-01-21,traction,"Not the best traction of the Kyrie line, but still amazing."
13271,312,86,9.0,2018-02-26,traction,"The multi-directional herringbone works well, but some break-in time and occasional wiping is required."
13272,312,293,6.0,2018-01-05,traction,"The traction started of really slippery but gut better after a break-in period. Unfortunately, it remained pretty inconsistent and never lived up to the high standards of previous Kyrie models."
13273,312,32,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,Traction was hit or miss with the Kyrie 4. Dusty courts can be problematic.
13274,312,221,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction is pretty solid but I had to wipe pretty much any chance I got.
13275,312,522,8.0,2018-01-05,traction,"Overall, traction works well on clean floors and is serviceable on dusty floors but there are better options than the Kyrie 4 traction."
13276,312,486,9.0,2018-01-29,traction,The traction on the Kyrie 4 is really aggressive.
13277,312,6,9.0,2017-12-29,cushion,The full-length cushlon provides cushion and impact protection without sacrificing court feel and responsiveness. I really enjoy this cushion setup.
13278,312,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Cushion is the best it’s ever been in any Kyrie model.
13279,312,615,9.0,2018-01-14,cushion,This setup is ideal for players looking for court feel that still need some adequate impact protection.
13280,312,45,9.0,2018-01-21,cushion,The full-length Cushlon feels soft under your feet and is a great balance for guards and even bigger guys.
13281,312,86,9.0,2018-02-26,cushion,As a big man I enjoyed the setup.
13282,312,293,10.0,2018-01-05,cushion,"Wow - what an improvement!  The zoom unit in the heel and the full-length cushlon sole provide great impact protection, nice heel-to-toe transition and a responsive court feel. Amazing!"
13283,312,32,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"By far the best cushioning setup in the Kyrie line, but still pretty firm. I would have liked more impact protection."
13284,312,221,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Nike Zoom unit in the heel and Cushlon foam in the forefoot is a great improvement over the Kyrie 3.
13285,312,522,8.0,2018-01-05,cushion,"Heel cushioning is great and the cushlon sole is more comfortable than Phylon, but performs only decently to me during play."
13286,312,486,8.0,2018-01-29,cushion,Low-profile cushioning is a great balance between impact protection and court feel.
13287,312,6,9.0,2017-12-29,materials,Engineered mesh upper feels good and the suede on the back is a nice touch.
13288,312,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Lightweight engineered mesh, nylon and suede heel - doesn't feel cheap at all!"
13289,312,615,9.0,2018-01-14,materials,We don't get anything premium but get some decent materials that come close.
13290,312,45,9.0,2018-01-21,materials,The materials are good and feel comfortable straight out of the box this time.
13291,312,86,9.0,2018-02-26,materials,Engineered mesh and suede are a great mix at this price.

13294,312,221,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"I love the sued leather panels, but the nylon backed mesh is a little disappointing."
13295,312,522,8.0,2018-01-05,materials,Materials and build quality are about what you’d expect at the $120 retail price.
13296,312,486,8.0,2018-01-29,materials,The mesh and flywire feel fair.
13297,312,6,9.5,2017-12-29,support,"For me, this is one of the best support systems I ever experienced in a basketball shoe. Great lockdown and no side-to-side movement at all."
13298,312,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Support on the Kyrie 4 was something I had no issues with.
13299,312,615,9.0,2018-01-14,support,I felt very secure.
13300,312,45,9.0,2018-01-21,support,Gives you all the support and lockdown a quick guard needs.
13301,312,86,9.0,2018-02-26,support,"The ""teeth"" stabilize you laterally and the heel counter locks you down nicely."
13302,312,293,9.0,2018-01-05,support,"No heel slippage, no lateral movement, overall great support."
13303,312,32,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Traditional flywire lacing system, broad base, and internal heel counter provide great support."
13304,312,221,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Very smooth heel-to-toe transition, the support is my favorite feature of the Kyrie 4."
13305,312,522,9.0,2018-01-05,support,Overall I feel support and stability are very good and even better than the Kyrie 3. Nice job Nike!
13306,312,486,8.0,2018-01-29,support,The support is fair and works well for smaller guys. Bigger guys might look for more support.
13307,312,6,9.0,2017-12-29,fit,"The half-bootie upper,  traditional lacing system and narrow cut provide a great 1-1 fit after a short break-in period."
13308,312,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,I always felt secure in the shoe and never felt my foot sliding around at any time
13309,312,615,9.0,2018-01-14,fit,As long as you tie these kicks up nice and snug you will be good to go.
13310,312,86,9.0,2018-02-26,fit,The Kyrie series has always been solid from a fit standpoint.
13311,312,293,9.0,2018-01-05,fit,The fit is super nice and comfortable.
13312,312,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,"I had some problems with the heel digging into my Achilles, but after breaking them in they became more comfortable."
13313,312,221,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The Kyrie 4 fits like a glove.
13314,312,522,9.0,2018-01-05,fit,The plush interior is comfortable and provides enough wiggle room to accommodate different foot shapes. There was no lateral movement or heel slippage at all!
13315,312,45,100.0,2018-01-21,outdoor,A solid rubber colorway should be good outdoors.
13316,312,293,0.0,2018-01-05,outdoor,"The rubber is pretty soft, we wouldn't recommend outdoor use."
13317,312,293,2,2018-01-05,width,The fit is slightly narrow but less so than the Kyrie 3.
13318,312,522,2,2018-01-05,width,Wide footers will probably want to go up half a size due to the narrow midfoot.
13319,312,45,3,2018-01-21,size,Fits true to size.
13320,312,293,3,2018-01-05,size,Go true to size.

13323,313,615,9.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"The Way of Wade 6 is a solid performer, and I enjoy this shoe a lot. I find myself going to this sneaker just about much as I go to my Dame 4s."
13324,313,32,9.0,2018-02-26,expert_overall,"Materials and cushion are great, support and traction are solid. With a few tweaks this could have been the sneaker of the year!"
13325,313,33,8.8,2018-01-14,expert_overall,The Way of Wade 6 competes with most of the top-tier shoes offered from other brands.
13326,313,293,8.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"Very comfortable, really nice traction - I love the performance of these. The only downside is the lateral containment and the excessive toe room."
13327,313,615,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,This traction pattern performed a lot better than what I thought it was going to.
13328,313,32,8.0,2018-02-26,traction,Traction is good but not great.
13329,313,33,7.0,2018-01-14,traction,Good but not great.
13330,313,293,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,"Very good bite, sticks like glue, and minimal wiping."
13331,313,615,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,Super comfortable and great impact protection but not very responsive.
13332,313,32,10.0,2018-02-26,cushion,"The cushioning is by far the best part of this shoe. This is the perfect combination of comfort, impact protection, and responsiveness."
13333,313,33,9.5,2018-01-14,cushion,Fantastic. Simply fantastic.
13334,313,293,10.0,2017-12-27,cushion,"The cushion is super soft, low-to-the-ground, and provides great impact protection."

13336,313,32,9.0,2018-02-26,materials,The knitted upper is very comfortable and feels light.
13337,313,33,9.5,2018-01-14,materials,"This upper is truly ready to go fresh out the box, no break-in required."
13338,313,293,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,The material is nice and gets super soft.
13339,313,615,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"External heel counter, broad base and the ankle strap provide great stability and support."

13341,313,293,6.0,2017-12-27,support,The upper material stretches too much on lateral cuts. Heel lockdown was pretty good though.
13342,313,615,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The partial bootie upper does a great job of containing the foot keeping it in place.
13343,313,33,9.0,2018-01-14,fit,Containment on the Wade 6 is very much on point.
13344,313,293,6.0,2017-12-27,fit,I didn't like the huge amount of dead space in the toe box.
13345,313,293,4,2017-12-27,width,The Way of Wade 6 is pretty wide.
13346,313,293,4,2017-12-27,size,I went down half a size.
13347,314,293,8.6,2018-01-14,expert_overall,The Kyrie S1 perform pretty similar to the Kyrie 1 but feels a little bit bulkier.
13348,314,45,8.5,2017-12-29,expert_overall,This is a really nice concoction of the first three Kyrie models.
13349,314,33,8.3,2018-01-14,expert_overall,I was surprised with how much I enjoyed the shoe on-court.
13350,314,715,8.6,2022-01-14,user_overall,
13351,314,293,9.0,2018-01-14,traction,"Super loud squeak, hard bite, but dust is a problem."
13352,314,45,9.0,2017-12-29,traction,The modified Herringbone taken from the Kyrie 1 performed very well.
13353,314,33,7.0,2018-01-14,traction,"The traction wasn’t deal breaker bad, but it definitely made me appreciate what I experienced in the Kyrie 2, 3, and 4."
13354,314,293,8.0,2018-01-14,cushion,"The cushioning is pretty stiff, responsive and offers great court feel. Little impact protection though."
13355,314,45,9.0,2017-12-29,cushion,Zoom bag in the fore-foot is one of the great things about this shoe.
13356,314,33,7.0,2018-01-14,cushion,"While the cushion isn’t mind blowing or spectacular, it’s good enough."
13357,314,293,8.0,2018-01-14,materials,"Materials are okay, they become pretty soft after breaking them in and perform well."
13358,314,45,7.0,2017-12-29,materials,Pretty basic materials that take a long time to break in. I am not a fan of the suede strap.
13359,314,33,9.0,2018-01-14,materials,After breaking in the S1 Hybrid I wound up really enjoying how everything felt and played together.
13360,314,293,9.0,2018-01-14,support,The support is really good like we are used from the Kyrie series.
13361,314,45,9.0,2017-12-29,support,This is a very supportive shoe - maybe even too much for my type of game.
13362,314,33,9.0,2018-01-14,support,"Nothing special, but the S1 Hybrid has everything you need."

13366,314,45,2,2017-12-29,width,The fit is quite narrow
13367,315,293,9.6,2018-01-14,expert_overall,"I love how light and minimal the Curry 4 Low feels. Traction and cushion remained unchanged from the High-Top, but materials and fit are much improved."
13368,315,6,8.9,2018-01-14,expert_overall,I think the Curry 4 Low is an upgrade to the original version and I really love to play in them.
13369,315,33,8.6,2018-01-14,expert_overall,The Curry 4 Low offers great traction and stability for low-to-the-ground guards that prefer to be quick on their feet.
13370,315,32,8.5,2018-01-21,expert_overall,Better materials and fit compared to the Highs. But the same lackluster cushioning prevents these shoes from being a top performer.
13371,315,522,7.8,2018-01-21,expert_overall,"On the court, the Curry 4 Low doesn’t really do anything better than the mid, plus I had some heel slip."
13372,315,456,8.8,2022-11-12,user_overall,"The Curry 4 Lows are a joy to play in. The traction stands out above all, stopping on a dime! Aside from the knit which offers little support and the slightly odd fit in the heel of the shoe, I can’t hold much against the Curry 4 Lows! Truly a superb shoe!!!"

13374,315,293,9.0,2018-01-14,traction,The traction is really sticky and performs just as well as in the High model.
13375,315,6,9.0,2018-01-14,traction,I had zero problems on all courts I played on.
13376,315,33,9.0,2018-01-14,traction,Linear coverage is fantastic and lateral coverage is handled very well too.
13377,315,32,9.0,2018-01-21,traction,Traction takes a while to break-in but works very well after that.
13378,315,522,9.0,2018-01-21,traction,Same as the High which is a good thing.
13379,315,293,9.0,2018-01-14,cushion,"Thick and padded insole, cushioning is super low-to-the-ground and responsive."
13380,315,6,8.5,2018-01-14,cushion,Very responsive and low-to-the-ground with minimal impact protection.
13381,315,33,7.0,2018-01-14,cushion,This isn’t the shoe for people that need cushioning.
13382,315,32,8.0,2018-01-21,cushion,"Little to none impact protection, but great court-feel and responsiveness."
13383,315,522,7.0,2018-01-21,cushion,The cushioning feels okay albeit boring. Don’t expect it to last as the EVUA gets compressed.
13384,315,293,10.0,2018-01-14,materials,The upper material is a lot softer and more comfortable compared to the high-top version of the Curry 4.
13385,315,6,9.0,2018-01-14,materials,The materials feel way more premium compared to the Highs.
13386,315,33,9.0,2018-01-14,materials,All of the material components worked well with one another and have been fairly durable.
13387,315,32,9.0,2018-01-21,materials,The Low uses more knit and less synthetics which leads to a much more comfortable shoe.
13388,315,522,8.0,2018-01-21,materials,The materials feel softer and need less break-in time.
13389,315,293,10.0,2018-01-14,support,Great lockdown and the wide outrigger provides great stability.
13390,315,6,9.0,2018-01-14,support,The support is surprisingly good for such a minimal shoe. No side-to-side movement or heel slippage.
13391,315,33,9.0,2018-01-14,support,Despite being a minimal low-cut shoe the support is solid.
13392,315,32,9.0,2018-01-21,support,I feel like the Lows are a little more supportive compared to the Highs.
13393,315,522,8.0,2018-01-21,support,"Overall, support is very minimal but stability is excellent."
13394,315,293,10.0,2018-01-14,fit,The fit is really nice and comfortable.
13395,315,6,9.0,2018-01-14,fit,The 1:1 fit is amazing after a short break-in period.
13396,315,33,9.0,2018-01-14,fit,The Curry 4 Low breaks in rather quickly but will remain snug at all times.
13397,315,32,9.0,2018-01-21,fit,The Lows feel a lot more comfortable and flexible than the Highs.
13398,315,522,7.0,2018-01-21,fit,"Overall, the fit was decent but the heel slip was annoying."
13399,315,293,50.0,2018-01-14,outdoor,The rubber is fairly hard and thick.
13400,315,6,2,2018-01-14,width,Very snug in the beginning.
13401,315,6,3,2018-01-14,size,True to size.
13402,315,522,2,2018-01-21,size,I suggest going half a size up.
13403,316,293,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Curry 4 feels super-duper responsive. As one of the lightest shoes on the market, it provides great traction, tight fit, and low-to-the-ground feeling which makes it the perfect shoe for quick guards."
13404,316,6,8.9,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Curry 4 is a great shoe for guards that rely on quick, responsive movements. I really liked everything about it except the very minimal impact protection."
13405,316,176,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Curry 4 is a great shoe for quick, ball-handling point guards who need speed with no lag."
13406,316,615,8.7,2017-01-01,expert_overall,The Under Armour Curry 4 is a fantastic shoe for anyone looking for court feel. For the people who want impact protection I’d say stay clear from the Curry 4.
13407,316,33,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Curry 4 feels like it should have come after the Curry 2. It provides a better fit, greater stability, and more control."
13408,316,32,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I have mixed feelings about the Curry 4. Traction is a strong point, materials are 50:50, support and cushion are decent. However, I can't help to be a little disappointed."
13409,316,486,8.5,2017-12-29,expert_overall,These get the job done - especially if you are looking for a shoe that is really supportive.
13410,316,45,8.5,2018-01-14,expert_overall,"This is the best Curry signature shoe so far. Great traction, good cushioning and support - perfect for quick guards."
13411,316,522,8.2,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"The Curry 4 is for the quick guard who likes a low to the ground ride with responsive cushioning, tight traction, stability and containment for quick cuts and movements."
13412,316,221,7.8,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"Overall, I am a little disappointed by the Curry 4, mainly due to the very firm cushioning and budget material."
13413,316,497,8.7,2022-01-13,user_overall,"The Under Armour Curry 4 is a great shoe for guards! It is a fast and responsive shoe, and it is very light. The traction was amazing on clean courts, and it was pretty good on dust as well. The shoe lacks cushioning, but if you want a responsive shoe with amazing court feel, this shoe is for you! The support was pretty good because of the upper, and it locks you in so your foot doesn’t move off the footbed. The upper is also pretty good, it is thin and breathable, but it takes time to break in."
13414,316,740,10.0,2022-06-01,user_overall,10/10 amazing such a good shoe I had no problems. Overall amazing shoe
13415,316,741,8.2,2023-03-18,user_overall,"Takes time to out on, wears down quickly if you play outdoors"
13416,316,346,8.4,2023-01-07,user_overall,
13417,316,742,9.8,2023-03-15,user_overall,
13418,316,293,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Traction is freaking nice!
13419,316,6,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Great traction in all direction. But the translucent outsoles pick up a decent amount of dust.
13420,316,176,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"No herringbone, no problem — especially on clean courts."
13421,316,615,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The circular traction patterns works well on clean and dusty courts.
13422,316,33,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The spiral pattern put in place offers multi-directional coverage for any move performed at any time. Linear coverage is fantastic and lateral coverage is handled very well too.
13423,316,32,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction pattern needs a little to break in and picks up a lot of dust. But a few wipes here and there and you are good to go!
13424,316,486,9.0,2017-12-29,traction,The traction is a strong point of the Curry 4.
13425,316,45,10.0,2018-01-14,traction,The traction is the standout feature of the Under Armour Curry 4.
13426,316,522,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,These have a nice bite to them and but need the occasional wipe to stay sticky depending on how dusty the floor is.
13427,316,221,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,The traction was absolutely fantastic on all surfaces.
13428,316,293,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The cushioning is very thin so you feel very low to the ground. However, impact protection is still decent."
13429,316,6,8.5,2017-01-01,cushion,"Cushioning is very, very minimal. Great responsiveness and court feel, but you don't get a lot of impact protection."
13430,316,176,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Great court feel and responsiveness, but there is almost no impact protection."
13431,316,615,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,This is what I like to call “bricks in a pillow cushion. I am not a fan of it all.
13432,316,33,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"This isn’t the shoe for people looking for cushioning. Much like the Curry models of the past, these are all about control, court feel, and stability."
13433,316,32,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Cushioning is very minimal, firm and responsive. I wish it had a little more impact protection."
13434,316,486,8.0,2017-12-29,cushion,"The cushioning is not bad, but there is definitely room for improvement."
13435,316,45,8.0,2018-01-14,cushion,Midsole cushioning is very minimal which gives you great court feel but zero impact protection.
13436,316,522,7.0,2017-12-27,cushion,"The Curry 4 sits very low and has a firm, minimal cushioning set up."
13437,316,221,6.0,2017-12-27,cushion,These have no cushioning whatsoever.
13438,316,293,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Painful break-in period, but the thin and stretchy materials are really nice after that."
13439,316,6,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The one-bootie upper made out of knit provides great lockdown and gives you a nice 1-1 fit.
13440,316,176,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The new materials cut down on weight drastically while still providing fit and support.
13441,316,615,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The materials are going to take a few hoop session to break in.
13442,316,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The synthetic breaks in very nicely and mimics leather in a way that I hadn’t expected.
13443,316,32,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"At first, the upper material feels stiff and plasticky. The synthetic overlay softens up after a while. The knit is great though!"
13444,316,486,8.0,2017-12-29,materials,"I like the knit upper, but the synthetics that wrap around the sneaker are not up to the standards of a signature model."
13445,316,45,8.0,2018-01-14,materials,A long break-in time is required but then it's fine.
13446,316,522,7.0,2017-12-27,materials,"Overall, materials feel cheap and may turn off some consumers."
13447,316,221,7.0,2017-12-27,materials,"Out of the box, the materials felt pretty cheap. However, they broke in nicely and got more comfortable."
13448,316,293,10.0,2017-01-01,support,The tight fit of the upper ensures great lockdown and lateral containment.
13449,316,6,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Internal heel counter, lateral outrigger and speed plate provide a nice overall support."
13450,316,176,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"For a seriously lightweight and minimal shoe, support and stability aren’t a problem."
13451,316,615,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The support is great.
13452,316,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Despite being a minimal shoe, the support is solid."
13453,316,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,The base of the shoe is very wide for a ton of stability. The ankle sleeve doesn't provide any ankle support as it is thin as a sock.
13454,316,486,9.0,2017-12-29,support,This shoe is very supportive.
13455,316,45,8.0,2018-01-14,support,The support is alright but I am missing a heel counter.
13456,316,522,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"Stability really shines on the Curry 4. Low to the ground, firm cushioning, forefoot outrigger, a split heel, and a very stable wide outsole feel stable and safe on all movements."
13457,316,293,10.0,2017-01-01,fit,"There is no dead space anywhere - the fit is really, really nice."
13458,316,6,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"If you get the correct size, the fit is really tight and provides great lockdown."
13459,316,176,10.0,2017-01-01,fit,"This is the best fitting Curry yet, and that is saying something after the incredible fit of the Curry 2."
13460,316,615,9.5,2017-01-01,fit,Now that is what you call a one-to-one fit.
13461,316,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Lockdown on the Curry 4 was excellent. The entire shoe is a sock, a very tight sock."
13462,316,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The break-in period was very painful for me, as the upper kept digging into my forefoot on the lateral side. After the break-in period, the fit was more comfortable, but there was  some dead space."
13463,316,522,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,"Overall the fit is excellent if you fit the shoe correctly or if you adjust to the shoe by wearing thinner or thicker socks.  Unfortunately, the fit is very specific which makes it hard to find the right size."
13464,316,221,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The fit is probably the best feature of the Curry 4.
13465,316,293,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,Outdoor should be okay because the rubber is hard and thick.
13466,316,522,2,2017-12-27,width,Wide footers may want to go up in size for comfort.
13467,316,6,3,2017-01-01,size,It's important to go true to size because of the one-bootie upper.
13468,316,486,3,2017-12-29,size,These run true to size.
13469,316,45,2,2018-01-14,size,"Go up half a size, otherwise, the shoe is very uncomfortable."
13470,316,522,2,2017-12-27,size,Runs a little short but true to size for most everyone.
13471,317,293,9.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"One of the best performance shoes I have played in this year, especially at this price. A very nice shoe that will work for every type of player."
13472,317,33,9.1,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Anta KT3 is a great shoe. Between the Dame 4, Curry 4 and KT3 I have one hell of a lineup to choose from on any given night."
13473,317,221,8.6,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"I think Anta killed it with the KT3. This is a very affordable signature sneaker with a premium knitted upper, great traction and responsive cushioning."
13474,317,32,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,Premium materials as well as improved cushioning and traction - a definitive improvement over the KT2.
13475,317,739,8.5,2018-04-17,expert_overall,I enjoyed playing in the Anta KT3 and I would easily recommend the shoe for multiple player positions because of it's adequate cushioning.
13476,317,743,8.0,2022-08-07,user_overall,
13477,317,293,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction is super nice. On a clean court, it bites really hard, on a dusty court you will need to wipe a lot."
13478,317,33,9.5,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction on the ANTA KT3 looks like a finger print, à la the Air Jordan XX3, and like other circular patterns, it works wonderfully."
13479,317,221,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,The traction works fantastic on all surfaces.
13480,317,32,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The multi-directional traction pattern grips to the floor really well.
13481,317,739,8.0,2018-04-17,traction,The translucent rubber attracts a lot of dust and requires constant wiping which gets annoying quickly.
13482,317,293,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushioning feels soft and plush but is still responsive. I really enjoyed this setup.
13483,317,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The forefoot area heavily focuses on court feel while the heel focuses on impact protection.
13484,317,221,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,You are going to love the cushion if you are a forefoot heavy player. Very low-to-the-ground and responsive but minimal energy return.
13485,317,32,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushioning is soft but still responsive. Impact protection in the heel is improved compared to the KT2.
13486,317,739,8.5,2018-04-17,cushion,The Anta EVE cushioning is very comfortable and provides a lot of impact protection.
13487,317,293,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,The knitted upper material is super soft and doesn't need any break-in period.
13488,317,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Durable and comfortable knit backed by nylon and glue — and I love it.
13489,317,221,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,The fully knitted upper is flexible and comfortable.
13490,317,32,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Soft and flexible knit feels really nice and works very well.
13491,317,739,8.5,2018-04-17,materials,The Anta KT3 features a knit upper which is on par with today's trend.
13492,317,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,I didn't have any issues with support and lockdown.
13493,317,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Everything you need is there and it all works well.
13494,317,221,8.0,2017-12-27,support,The support was great and made me want to run my cuts a little tighter and more quickly - just like Klay Thompson!
13495,317,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,The traditional lacing system and the internal heel counter provide excellent containment.  The wide outrigger ensures lateral stability during cuts.
13496,317,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The fit is amazing.
13497,317,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The fit is a bit looser and less suffocating than in the KT2.
13498,317,221,8.0,2017-12-27,fit,The KT3 fit is rather particular and won't work for every player. Tight in the midfoot but there is a bit of dead space in the toe box.
13499,317,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The material and cushioning are really comfortable. Unfortunately, the lateral outrigger was pinching my toes on my left foot."
13500,317,739,8.5,2018-04-17,fit,The fit is nice and works well even without the strap.
13501,317,293,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,"Rubber is pretty firm, so outdoor use should be okay."
13502,318,86,9.3,2018-01-05,expert_overall,"The LeBron 15 is one of the best LeBron shoes ever. Materials, fit, and cushion are the definite highlights of the shoe."
13503,318,6,9.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I think this is one of the best Lebrons ever. Material usage is great, cushioning is great, support is great -  basically, everthing is really nice! But keep in mind that this shoe is made for big and heavy players, and won't work as well for smaller guards."
13504,318,615,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, the LeBron 15 is a fun shoe to play in. Especially, the cushion is fabulous!"
13505,318,45,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Lebron 15 is the best Lebron of all time. This shoe ticks all the boxes, the only slight downside was the traction."
13506,318,176,8.9,2018-01-21,expert_overall,"This may be the best playing LeBron shoe ever. If you are looking for the absolute best Nike cushioning in basketball and a shoe that bleeds technology, the LeBron 15 is your ride."
13507,318,33,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I love pieces of the LeBron 15. Materials and fit are highlights, and the cushion is the best Nike has offered in years. Stability made them a bit concerning for me while on the floor and I never ended up feeling as comfortable as I wanted to be."
13508,318,293,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"My favorite Lebron ever - I really enjoyed playing in the Lebron 15. The cushioning is insane, the materials are as premium as it gets, unfortunately, the price is too."
13509,318,522,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"There are a lot of positives with the LBJ 15 especially the cushioning, the fit, and the soft materials. Traction isn’t horrible but it definitely isn’t King worthy and needs some serious break in and wear to improve."
13510,318,649,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The LeBron 15 doesn’t offer anything truly groundbreaking in terms of its design, but it’s taken existing concepts and improved on nearly everything. The traction was the only real downer for me, but it wasn’t bad enough to ruin the things I did like."
13511,318,32,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"As a small guard, I didn't love the high-off-the-ground feeling and the laggy cushioning. However, if you are a bigger, heavier and powerful player than you will love the Lebron 15."
13512,318,470,8.8,2021-10-25,user_overall,"The LeBron 15 overall was pretty good. It had good traction, very comfortable cushion, nice feeling materials, and snug fit. The support on the other hand wasn't that nice considering the movement in the footbed, and the durability wasn't that good either since I ran through my outsole in about a week and half. But for the most part, it was solid."
13513,318,744,9.4,2023-06-26,user_overall,"The shoe is amazing on court, and has great support and cushion. I rarely roll my ankle or get ankle injuries with these shoes. The main problem is the side to side movements and traction on outdoor surfaces."
13514,318,71,9.0,2022-03-19,user_overall,Great shoes with one con in the sole being too tight which had me rolling my ankle in random occasions while running.

13516,318,745,9.0,2023-01-15,user_overall,
13517,318,86,9.0,2018-01-05,traction,The traction does well overall — I just wish it had more bite.
13518,318,6,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction is pretty damn good even on a translucent rubber colorway. On dusty courts, you will need to wipe a lot."
13519,318,615,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The LeBron 15 features a spiked triangle pattern that made the traction dope.
13520,318,45,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction looks beastly, unfortunately, it didn't perform quite as well as I had hoped."
13521,318,176,9.0,2018-01-21,traction,"Nowhere near the best, or even great, but it was good enough."
13522,318,33,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Linear traction bites and grips the floor really well, lateral traction could be better."
13523,318,293,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,Traction has problems with lateral cuts as the pattern is not multidirectional.
13524,318,522,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,I’ve said over and over that traction has never really been a strength of the Lebron sig line and these are really no different.
13525,318,649,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,The LeBron 15’s traction isn’t awful – more like slightly below average.
13526,318,32,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,The grip is pretty solid.
13527,318,86,10.0,2018-01-05,cushion,"If you need the cushion as much as my knees do, then this is where it is at."
13528,318,6,9.5,2017-01-01,cushion,"The cushioning is extremely bouncy and very plush. For my liking, it was a little bit too high of the ground though."
13529,318,615,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The LeBron 15 is best feeling cushion setup I have ever experienced on any LeBron shoe.
13530,318,45,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushioning setup works like a charm. It's extremely comfortable but still provides decent court feel.
13531,318,176,10.0,2018-01-21,cushion,Best. Zoom. Ever.
13532,318,33,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Beast mode! If you’re a cushion-above-all-else type of player then you’ll love these.
13533,318,293,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The cushion is insanely bouncy, and impact protection is great. You lose some responsiveness and court feel due to the very high cushioning."
13534,318,522,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,This is pretty damn close to cushioning perfection.
13535,318,649,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The cushioning offers the best of both worlds, offering both response and defense against impact as well as smooth heel-to-toe transition."
13536,318,32,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushioning is by far the best part of this shoe. The cushioning feels as nice as diving into a pool of fluffiness!
13537,318,86,9.5,2018-01-05,materials,Battleknit feels awesome on feet.
13538,318,6,9.5,2017-01-01,materials,Stretchy and comfortable Battleknit material is amazing.
13539,318,615,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"To my surprise, the thick Flyknit felt good."
13540,318,45,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Battleknit upper combined fits very comfortably.
13541,318,176,9.5,2018-01-21,materials,"The comfort is there, the flexibility is freaking awesome, and the durability seems to be way better than past builds."
13542,318,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Battleknit is used here (aka really thick Flyknit) and it feels awesome on-foot.
13543,318,293,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,Battleknit material feels plush and premium.
13544,318,522,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Battleknit, or in layman’s terms, Flyknit with more texture and a synthetic backing. Nothing really innovative, just a cool name."
13545,318,32,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The Battleknit material is pretty nice and very comfortable.
13546,318,86,9.0,2018-01-05,support,Those that require a lot of lateral movements may struggle due to the lack of stability.
13547,318,6,9.0,2017-01-01,support,External heel counter and Battleknit material contained my foot very well.
13548,318,615,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Great containment, no heel slippage, and very good ankle support."
13549,318,45,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"I have no complaints about support, I felt locked in from the start!"
13550,318,176,7.0,2018-01-21,support,There was a feeling of being uncontained that never had me feeling confident.
13551,318,33,7.0,2017-01-01,support,Midsole and outsole lack a wide enough base which really hurts the lateral stability and overall support.
13552,318,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Heel lockdown is great but lateral containment could be improved. The narrow base, lack of outrigger, and high cushioning hold back the stability and support."
13553,318,522,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Stability is good but could have been improved with the use of an outrigger.
13554,318,649,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"The interior collar locks down the heel respectably well. Along with additional stability provided by the external heel counter, I found a secure fit."
13555,318,32,6.0,2017-01-01,support,Support wasn't really good for me. I didn't feel stable or balanced because the shoe is very high off the ground.
13556,318,86,9.0,2018-01-05,fit,Comfortable fit with no break-in time.
13557,318,6,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The one-bootie upper is easy to get on and provides a great 1:1 fit.
13558,318,615,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Lockdown is the bomb.
13559,318,45,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The one-bootie upper is easy to get in and fits nicely.
13560,318,176,9.0,2018-01-21,fit,Battleknit wraps perfectly around your foot without feeling restrictive.
13561,318,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Once you’re in the LeBron 15 and laced up, especially if you opt for going down half size, you’ll be locked in and ready to go."
13562,318,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The stretchy material provides a great fit.
13563,318,522,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,I had zero issues with heel slip and no movement side to side from the get-go.
13564,318,649,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The shoe is supremely comfortable while maintaining stability and protection.
13565,318,32,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Nice and comfortable fit.
13566,318,6,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,"The rubber is soft, I wouldn't recommend these for outdoor use."
13567,318,293,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,The rubber seems pretty durable.
13568,318,293,3,2017-01-01,width,Runs a little more narrow than most Lebrons.
13569,318,6,3,2017-01-01,size,I went true to size.
13570,318,45,4,2017-01-01,size,They fit a tiny bit long.
13571,318,293,4,2017-01-01,size,Go down half a size.
13572,318,522,4,2017-01-01,size,The XV runs a little long but fit fine true to size for my wide feet.
13573,319,33,9.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,The Air Jordan 32 is a huge step in the right direction. Everything feels refined. If Jordan Brand can keep the stability but increase the flexibility then it will have perfected the Flight Speed setup. I think people are going to like this one.
13574,319,615,9.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Air Jordan XXXII is a banger for real. This shoe has everything you need: good traction, good cushion, excellent materials, and amazing support."
13575,319,86,9.2,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"This is hands down the best on-court Air Jordan Model to date, as it should be. Every feature fits the mold to near perfection. Jordan Brand took a huge step in the right direction across all performance aspects."
13576,319,522,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The AJ XXXII is a great shoe that should satisfy everyone except the minimalist hoop crowd that love shoes like the Kobe 8, Mamba Mentality, Instinct etc"
13577,319,6,9.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"Across the spectrum, this shoe performs very well and should work for all types of players. Pretty pricey, but worth every penny!"
13578,319,221,8.8,2017-12-27,expert_overall,The Air Jordan 32 is a great performer and I was a little sad when I had to put these aside to test other performance shoes. The only two downsides are the long break-in period and the hefty price tag.
13579,319,649,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Despite sky-high expectations, the Air Jordan 32 mostly delivers. I liked the more minimal collar and feel of the 31s cushioning better, but thought the 32 offered far superior traction and a smoother transition."
13580,319,486,8.7,2018-01-14,expert_overall,I think this is a great shoe for in-between players who are looking for a good mix of comfortable cushioning and responsiveness.
13581,319,701,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I think Jordan brand did a great job with the XXXII. This has taken over the Nike PG1 as my go-to basketball shoes.  Traction, cushioning and lockdown are all great - what else do you need in a performance sneaker?"
13582,319,32,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Pros: Great Traction, Cushioning provides a good balance between impact protection and res"
13583,319,45,8.5,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"Overall, I would describe the Air Jordan 32 as a responsive shoe with ultimate support. Great for big guys, but unfortunately, the traction was pretty disappointing."
13584,319,293,8.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,Nice shoes with premium materials and nice cushioning. I was a bit disappointed by the traction and the lateral containment. At a steep $185 I wouldn't recommend these.
13585,319,560,9.2,2023-12-22,user_overall,"You could climb a wall in these shoes. They will grip to anything, no matter how much dust is on the surface. I played competitively for 3 years in a pair of these shoes. I liked to tie my laces tight, and the loops on the upper portion of the shoe are barely separating at this point. All good things come to an end, and I was sad to retire these shoes due to my worries over the durability of the loops. Everything else about the Jordan 32 is exemplary!"

13589,319,33,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Not only did they grip the court, but it gripped really well."
13590,319,615,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Traction on the Air Jordan XXXII was straight up beast mode compared to the 31.
13591,319,86,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,"No matter hard the cuts I made, the Air Jordan 32 traction pattern played to all my needs."
13592,319,522,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Great traction especially on clean floors but not in the top tier across the spectrum of conditions.
13593,319,6,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,The traction has an amazing bite and squeaks like nothing else.
13594,319,221,8.0,2017-12-27,traction,The overall experience was pretty consistent but not perfect. You will need to wipe often on dusty courts.
13595,319,649,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The 32’s grip is as good as any I can remember an Air Jordan having.
13596,319,486,8.0,2018-01-14,traction,The traction can be hit or miss.
13597,319,701,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction is really good. Inside or outside, we didn't have any problems."
13598,319,32,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction is probably the best aspect of the shoe. Even on dusty courts, you will need to wipe only very little."
13599,319,45,6.0,2017-12-27,traction,The traction didn't feel great and took a lot of wiping. If you are a defender who likes to slip and slide - this is the shoe for you!
13600,319,293,5.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Not as bad as the Jordan 31, but not as good as the D Rose 8 or Kyrie 3 either."
13601,319,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Heel and forefoot segmented Zoom Air returns and for me, this setup feels more balanced than unlocked setups in the past."
13602,319,615,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The Air Jordan XXXII’s cushion is still money and the impact protection is excellent.
13603,319,86,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,The cushion setup provides enough stability and impact protection to give you springy bounce-back.
13604,319,522,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"This set up doesn’t blow my mind but it feels like Zoom should and is a great blend of impact protection, responsiveness, and stability."
13605,319,6,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,Phylon carrier with unlocked Zoom in the front and regular Zoom in the heel. I wish more shoes would use this type of setup.
13606,319,221,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,"Very long break-in period, but after that, you get amazing energy return and high-level responsiveness. Probably the most versatile cushioning setup out there today."
13607,319,649,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The cushioning offers more than ample impact protection, but it just didn’t feel as dynamic as those models with the carved-out bags."
13608,319,486,9.0,2018-01-14,cushion,Great balance between court feel and impact protection.
13609,319,701,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Low to the ground feeling, bouncy but still responsive with good impact protection. I absolutely love it."
13610,319,32,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The cushioning is well-balanced. The midsole is a bit firm at first, but after a while the transition is fine."
13611,319,45,10.0,2017-12-27,cushion,The cushioning is clearly my favorite part of this shoe.
13612,319,293,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushion is very firm and responsive. Heel to toe transition is a bit clunky in the beginning. Subtle bounce and low to the ground feeling.
13613,319,33,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,I absolutely love the materials on the Air Jordan 32.
13614,319,615,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,I could not have asked for better materials.
13615,319,86,10.0,2017-12-27,materials,This is the Fyknit we’ve all been asking for.
13616,319,522,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Nice Flyknit JB. If you’re big into materials, you’ll enjoy these."
13617,319,6,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,The pure Flyknit upper feels amazing and offers a lot of containment.
13618,319,221,10.0,2017-12-27,materials,The best version of Flyknit ever used on performance basketball shoes.
13619,319,486,9.0,2018-01-14,materials,Comfy and moldable upper.
13620,319,701,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,I like the upper a lot. Gives you stability but it's not bulky in any way.
13621,319,32,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Probably the best Flyknit that was ever put on a basketball shoe. The inside of the shoe is very soft and comfortable. Unfortunately, the heel area is very bulky and restrictive."
13622,319,45,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,"The Flyknit upper feels really nice and comfortable. Unfortunately, it's also pretty heavy and not very breathable."
13623,319,293,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,This s**t is crazy. The very premium materials feel great and look amazing.
13624,319,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Support shouldn’t be an issue. A solid outrigger, as well as an internal and external heel counter, worked well."
13625,319,615,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The support is bomb too.
13626,319,86,9.0,2017-12-27,support,The support gives you exactly what is needed and removes everything else.
13627,319,522,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Stability is excellent on the XXXII thanks to forefoot outrigger and a fairly flat outsole around the heel.
13628,319,6,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"No heel slippage, no side-to-side movement, and my ankle felt really secure."
13629,319,221,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"No thrills, no gimmicks - the support does a great job without doing anything special."
13630,319,649,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"The molded collar, along with the ribbed external heel counter, give rock-solid stability. Combined with the forefoot outrigger, the shoe feels safe and secure."
13631,319,701,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Lockdown is excellent, lacing setup is a little bit tricky. Firm cushioning also helps with feeling very stable and secure."
13632,319,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Ankle support is very good but feels a little restrictive and bulky.
13633,319,45,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"The support is fantastic, maybe even too much for smaller and quicker players. Great for big guys!"
13634,319,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The Flyknit upper stretches a little too much for me. Ankle support is decent and lockdown is good.
13635,319,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The shoe just felt like it was made for my foot, something I really enjoy."
13636,319,615,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,My foot did not move in this shoe no matter what I did.
13637,319,86,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The materials are comfortable and nicely conform to my foot.
13638,319,522,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"No heel slip or movement side to side, just a tighter and more refined fit than the XXXI. Great job JB!"
13639,319,6,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,After the material breaks in the one-bootie upper gives you a great 1:1 fit.
13640,319,221,8.0,2017-12-27,fit,"After breaking them in, you start to feel every thread of Flyknit wrap around your foot.  Great lockdown, but the midfoot was a little tight and I had a little dead space in the toebox."
13641,319,649,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The bootie style upper makes this shoe a bit hard to get on but does fit securely from the start.
13642,319,701,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,The shoe fits very snug and I felt a little bit of pressure in the heel. After time went on the felt better.
13643,319,32,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Nice and plush feeling around your feet.
13644,319,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"After breaking them in they are very comfortable. Materials fit really nicely to your feet, no unnecessary dead space at all."
13645,319,701,100.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,Outdoor traction was good.
13646,319,45,50.0,2017-12-27,outdoor,A solid rubber version should do the trick outdoors.
13647,319,293,100.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,"The rubber is super hard and thick, so outdoor use should be good."
13648,319,6,2,2017-12-27,width,The shoe feels slightly narrow.
13649,319,701,2,2017-01-01,width,They fit really snug and there is no dead space at all.
13650,319,293,2,2017-01-01,width,These run pretty narrow.
13651,319,522,4,2017-01-01,size,They are a tad long but I only had a little more than a finger width at the toe box which is my preference.
13652,319,6,4,2017-12-27,size,Runs a tad bit long.
13653,319,701,3,2017-01-01,size,"Very snug, but I wouldn't recommend sizing up."
13654,319,293,4,2017-01-01,size,Maybe you want to go down half a size.
13655,320,33,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,The Dame line continues to be the best signature you can get for your money. Bang for your buck like no other.
13656,320,32,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,This is a really good performance basketball shoe - probably one of the best basketball shoes of 2017! Especially at the low list price of $115.
13657,320,615,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I was having so much fun in this kick I didn’t want to stop. If there was a category for “fun to play in” I would rate the Dame 4 Hall of Fame!
13658,320,176,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"With good cushioning, good fit, and good materials, the Dame 4 is good at everything. As an overall package, this is one of the most complete and fun shoes to play in that you will ever find."
13659,320,86,9.0,2017-12-29,expert_overall,"Decent cushion, good fit, good materials — the shoe is good for everything on the court and gives you a great overall package."
13660,320,293,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I loved playing in these. Perfect for guards who want to be low to the ground and are looking for a very responsive shoe.
13661,320,6,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,The Dame 4 is the perfect shoe for quick guards and offers amazing performance at a very affordable price.
13662,320,522,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I really really really enjoy playing in this shoe but only on clean or slightly dusty floors. But the fact that I would even consider playing in these despite the meh traction speaks volumes about how fun this shoe is overall.
13663,320,45,8.6,2017-12-27,expert_overall,The Dame 4 is an underrated shoe that works very well for quick guards.
13664,320,486,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,This is probably the best performing shoe to hoop in right now! This shoe is really smooth and I come back to it all the time.
13665,320,221,8.5,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"Traction, cushion, fit were all great, and the support system is all I need. This is one of the best-value sneakers I have ever worn!"
13666,320,136,9.1,2022-06-20,user_overall,"Best shoe I’ve played in. Only the Kyrie 6 were close to match it. It’s perfect for a quick and responsive point guard. You feel very low to the ground while you have very decent impact protection. I loved it. It may take some time to break in the traction, not too long; once it goes, it’s an amazing performer."
13667,320,372,5.8,2022-07-10,user_overall,Was not a top tier performer to be fair and I honestly didn't like playing in it.Also the fit was the worst one I have experienced yet.The only positive think is the cushion.

13673,320,615,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"As weird as this outsole may look, the performance is insane."
13674,320,176,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The Dame 4 doesn’t feel aggressive in stops, but it never slipped out or slid while playing, which makes me a happy player."
13675,320,86,9.0,2017-12-29,traction,This traction was as spot on as any other shoe I’ve played in this year.
13676,320,293,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction started off really bad but got a lot better after breaking in. Overall, the traction is solid, but you will need to wipe a lot on dusty courts."
13677,320,6,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"On clean courts, the bite of the traction pattern is amazing. On dusty courts, it still held up pretty well."
13678,320,522,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"After the break-in period, the traction isn't bad but it definitely isn’t middle top to top tier either."
13679,320,45,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,I play on one of the dustiest courts of London and this traction did a fantastic job.
13680,320,486,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction is a bit inconsistent and collects dust very fast. In clean gyms, it works very well."
13681,320,221,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,These gripped the floor very well for me!
13682,320,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Very low to the ground,  but the ""Bounce"" cushioning doesn't make you feel like you’re playing in a super firm cushion."
13683,320,32,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Man, do I love the cushioning in these. The perfect combination of comfort, responsiveness, court feel and impact protection."
13684,320,615,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,This setup is one of the best low profile setups I have ever experienced. You can really feel the court underneath your foot.
13685,320,176,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Normally, I like a more cushioned feel but the Dame 4 felt so fast and fun that losing a little cushioning was outweighed."
13686,320,86,9.0,2017-12-29,cushion,Cushion works well for those who look for a low ride and immediate responsiveness.
13687,320,293,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Full-length bounce cushioning is really nice. Probably one of the lowest basketball shoes ever with a very good court feel. Impact protection is still good, especially in the heel."
13688,320,6,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Low-to-the-ground, very responsive and decent impact protection. The ""Bounce"" cushioning does a great job."
13689,320,522,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Full-length Bounce is back again and I have zero complaints.
13690,320,45,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,"The full-length Bounce cushioning is low to the ground, soft and responsive - just what you want as a quick guard."
13691,320,486,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,I really like the Bounce cushioning.
13692,320,221,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,The Bounce cushioning is more on the responsive side which works well for explosive players.
13693,320,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Nice mesh that allows for much better airflow than the Dame 3 did.
13694,320,32,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Soft and comfy - I really like the materials.
13695,320,615,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Anything I did the materials were right there with me. No pinching, binding, nothing — just nicely ventilated mesh."
13696,320,176,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The upper is thick but not stiff and provides a combination of flex and padding that immediately forms to your foot and feels like an extension of your foot.
13697,320,86,9.0,2017-12-29,materials,For a “budget model” to provide materials of this caliber is amazing.
13698,320,293,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Materials are super nice and comfortable. The materials actually feel very premium - especially for the affordable price,"
13699,320,6,8.5,2017-01-01,materials,After the break-in period the materials feel really nice.
13700,320,522,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Materials aren’t high end in name, but feel and look premiumish."
13701,320,45,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,The materials feel nice but look dirty very quickly.
13702,320,221,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,"The materials are soft and comfortable, durability might be a problem."
13703,320,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Fairly flat and stable base, outrigger, internal heel counter, midfoot torsional shank, and a wonderful 1-to-1 fit provide you with excellent support."
13704,320,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"I had problems with the lacing system which made my foot move around a little inside the shoes. Otherwise, support is good."
13705,320,615,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"If the fit is right, then the support is outstanding."
13706,320,176,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Overall, it isn’t restrictive, but definitely stable and supportive."
13707,320,86,9.0,2017-12-29,support,"Internal heel counter, torsional support plate and lateral outrigger produce a shoe that is just flat out stable."
13708,320,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"I had problems with slight heel slippage. Otherwise, the materials are strong and durable and provide excellent support for such a low shoe."
13709,320,6,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Gone are the problems I had with heel slippage in the Dame 3. Overall, I had no problems at all with support."
13710,320,522,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Midfoot support is good and stability is excellent thanks to a very wide outsole and firmer, lower cushioning."
13711,320,45,8.0,2017-12-27,support,"Internal heel counter, cable lacing system, and lateral outrigger provide good support. You need to tie the shoe really tightly to avoid heel slippage."
13712,320,486,9.0,2017-01-01,support,This shoe is more supportive than I expected.
13713,320,221,8.0,2017-12-27,support,The support systems are minimal but get the job done!
13714,320,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The entire shoe fit me perfectly 1-to-1 and felt like they were made for me.
13715,320,615,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Lockdown is crazy. The compression collar holds you in place and the lacing system is fire.
13716,320,176,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The fit is so tight - the lacing system is almost not even needed.
13717,320,86,9.0,2017-12-29,fit,The shoe wraps around your foot seamlessly and acts like an extension of your body.
13718,320,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Snug as a bug.
13719,320,6,8.5,2017-01-01,fit,A very nicely fitting shoe.
13720,320,522,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"No heel slip, no lace pressure, no deadspace and no side to side movement"
13721,320,45,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The fit was perfectly fine.
13722,320,486,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Initially, it was hard to put this shoe on, but now my feet are slipping right in."
13723,320,293,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,"Outdoor use is not recommended. Traction pattern is shallow, and rubber is on the softer side."
13724,320,45,0.0,2017-12-27,outdoor,I don't recommend these to play outdoors.
13725,320,293,2,2017-01-01,width,These run pretty narrow.
13726,320,522,2,2017-01-01,width,"For wide feet, I would stick with the regular size."
13727,320,293,4,2017-01-01,size,"I went half a size down, to my regular Adidas size."
13728,320,6,4,2017-01-01,size,Go down half a size from what you are wearing in Nike's or Under Armours.
13729,320,522,4,2017-01-01,size,Runs slightly large.
13730,320,45,3,2017-12-27,size,I got mine true to size.
13731,321,33,9.2,2018-01-24,expert_overall,The Air Jordan 32 is a huge step in the right direction.
13732,321,6,9.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,I think this shoe is worth every penny and I like the low-top version better than the regular mid. The Air Jordan 32 Low offers slightly better traction and more freedom of movement.
13733,321,45,8.8,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"You get amazing cushioning, and premium materials. Unfortunately, the traction is a real dust collector. Decent performer, but probably not worth the hefty price tag"
13734,321,293,8.2,2017-12-27,expert_overall,I really enjoyed playing in these! The Air Jordan 32 Low is super comfortable and performs very well.
13735,321,33,9.0,2018-01-24,traction,The Lows seem to uses better rubber overall.
13736,321,6,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,"The traction is a huge improvement over the Air Jordan 31. I had no slipping issues at all, even on dusty courts. The Lows seem to have a slightly better traction than the Mids."
13737,321,45,7.0,2017-12-27,traction,"The traction is better than the 31, but it's still not amazing. This traction pattern is a real dust collector."
13738,321,293,7.0,2017-12-27,traction,Performs very well on clean courts but you need to wipe a lot on dusty courts.
13739,321,33,9.0,2018-01-24,cushion,"For me, this setup feels more balanced than unlocked setups in the past."
13740,321,6,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,"The cushion setup felt a little clunky in the beginning. After the break-in period, the cushioning provides a really nice balance between responsiveness and impact protection."
13741,321,45,10.0,2017-12-27,cushion,The Flightspeed midsole is amazing. Beautiful responsive cushioning that makes you want to dunk every time you catch the ball.
13742,321,293,7.0,2017-12-27,cushion,Cushion is very responsive but the heel-to-toe transition is a little clunky.
13743,321,33,10.0,2018-01-24,materials,I absolutely love the materials on the Air Jordan 32.
13744,321,6,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,The tightly woven knit is very durable and feels very premium.
13745,321,45,10.0,2017-12-27,materials,This is probably the best Flyknit I ever felt in a basketball sneaker.
13746,321,293,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,The materials feel super premium and comfortable.
13747,321,33,9.0,2018-01-24,support,"There is an internal heel counter, as well as the visible external piece — both do their job well."
13748,321,6,9.0,2017-12-27,support,I like the feeling of a low-top and don't miss the added ankle support of the mid version. No heel slippage - no side-to-side movement.
13749,321,45,8.0,2017-12-27,support,Lockdown could have been better as I had to relace the shoe every 30 minutes.
13750,321,293,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"Overall support performs well, but on aggressive crossovers my feet came out of the footbed a little bit."
13751,321,33,9.0,2018-01-24,fit,"The shoe just felt like it was made for my foot, something I really enjoy."
13752,321,6,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The one-bootie-upper has a nice 1:1 fit.
13753,321,293,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,Tight and comfortable fit.
13754,321,45,50.0,2017-12-27,outdoor,"Outdoors, you will be fine."
13755,321,293,100.0,2017-12-27,outdoor,I played outdoors in these a few times and had no problems at all.
13756,321,6,2,2017-12-27,width,Fits slightly snug in the beginning.
13757,321,45,3,2017-12-27,width,The width is regular.
13758,321,293,1,2017-12-27,width,These are super narrow.
13759,321,6,4,2017-12-27,size,Runs just slightly long.
13760,321,45,4,2017-12-27,size,Fits a little bit longer.
13761,321,293,3,2017-12-27,size,True to size.
13762,322,293,9.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The performance of the D Rose 8 is stellar. Feels like a lighter, streamlined and more minimal D Rose 7. I love these shoes and put them on the top of my list of Adidas performance sneakers."
13763,322,176,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"By combining great traction, awesome cushioning, and serious fit, the Rose 8 is built for every player."
13764,322,6,8.9,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"For $140 this is a really good shoe. It brings everything you want: impact protection, responsiveness, ventilation, support and really good traction. If you like supportive high-tops, then this is the perfect shoe for you!"
13765,322,33,8.9,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"The Adidas D Rose 8 is a very solid shoe. Traction is my main gripe with the Rose 8, but everything from the midsole up worked really well."
13766,322,522,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Since the D Rose 5, we’ve gotten great cushioning, traction, support and stability, and a reliable fit year over year and the D Rose 8 is no different. Materials aren’t always the best but that’s always been a non-issue for me."
13767,322,45,8.6,2017-12-27,expert_overall,No distractions! This is a traditional basketball shoe and a great overall performer. This shoe worked very well for my style of game!
13768,322,748,8.4,2022-12-18,user_overall,everything was good especially the cushioning and traction . only problem i had was the laces were too short and hard to tie it properly . also the top front materials don't really last if you played frequently in it.
13769,322,749,8.0,2021-12-14,user_overall,Good shoe overall. Rather short so I had to take it a size and a half above. Outdoor it is quite durable but the traction and the cushion are average.
13770,322,750,9.1,2022-03-01,user_overall,
13771,322,751,10.0,2022-04-03,user_overall,
13772,322,293,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The new ""zipper"" traction is really nice. The stopping power is amazing."
13773,322,176,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The Rose 8 still stops on a dime and holds the floor like a grudge (word, Rakim). Dust was barely an issue because the pattern is wide and pushes any debris out and off the sole to keep you ripping."
13774,322,6,9.5,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction was really, really good. Very squeaky and very hard bite. I haven't slipped yet, and I have played on dusty courts."
13775,322,33,7.0,2017-12-27,traction,The rubber compound excelled while the pattern left a little to be desired.
13776,322,522,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Overall the traction is still very good.
13777,322,45,7.0,2017-12-27,traction,The traction is probably the worst part of this shoe. It's fine when it's clean but puts you on skates on dusty courts.
13778,322,293,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The full-length Boost setup provides an amazing balance between responsiveness, impact protection, court feel and heel-to-toe transition. You can't go wrong with this cushioning!"
13779,322,176,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Full-length Boost is thick and plush with serious impact protection.
13780,322,6,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The Boost setup is very bouncy in the heel and a little less pronounced in the front. If feels amazing while still providing responsiveness and court feel.
13781,322,33,10.0,2017-12-27,cushion,If you want a little bit of everything out of your cushion then this might be the setup you’ve been waiting for.
13782,322,522,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Very comfortable out of the box.
13783,322,45,10.0,2017-12-27,cushion,Full-length Boost gives you everything you need from a midsole.
13784,322,293,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,A very basic foam-backed mesh upper. It's a little stiff in the beginning but needs a little break in time.
13785,322,176,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,Mesh and fuse would feel right at home in 2012 but they feel great!
13786,322,6,8.5,2017-01-01,materials,Mesh upper with TPU overlay get the job done but they are not exactly premium.
13787,322,33,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,"It worked really well on-court, it just isn’t what I like."
13788,322,522,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,Zero issues with the materials although I’m sure many would prefer Primeknit.
13789,322,45,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,Pretty basic - but get the job done!
13790,322,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"The materials don't stretch, ankle support is really good and lockdown is solid."
13791,322,176,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"The upper is supportive with no stretch, so containment on hard cuts is strapped and locked. The ankle is locked in with the high cut and padding."
13792,322,6,9.0,2017-01-01,support,I had no side-to-side movement or heel slippage. Support features are almost too much for me.
13793,322,33,9.5,2017-12-27,support,"The heel counter keeps your ankle safe and secure, the wider forefoot offers great stability and the fuse upper contains your feet very well."
13794,322,522,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The D Rose 8 strikes a nice balance between support and flexibility.
13795,322,45,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"The support comes from the heel counter, outrigger, and the ankle collar. Ticks all the boxes!"
13796,322,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,For me the fit was amazing.
13797,322,176,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Let that mesh soften up with some run-time heat and then pull the laces tight and BAM! No sliding.
13798,322,6,8.5,2017-01-01,fit,Overall a great fitting shoe even for me as a wide-footer.
13799,322,33,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,Once laced up I felt secure.
13800,322,522,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,I think the generic simple design of the lacing set up will really make a broader set of players feet happy.
13801,322,45,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,Nice 1:1 fit.
13802,322,293,100.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,Thick and solid rubber should work well outdoors and the upper material is very durable too.
13803,322,45,0.0,2017-12-27,outdoor,Don't use the translucent rubber models outdoors.
13804,322,6,4,2017-01-01,width,A little bit of extra room in the toe area.
13805,322,522,4,2017-01-01,width,Comfortably width wide even for my wide feet.
13806,322,45,2,2017-12-27,width,This shoe fits a little narrow in the beginning.
13807,322,6,3,2017-01-01,size,I think they run true to size.
13808,322,522,4,2017-01-01,size,Half size down is best for everyone
13809,322,45,3,2017-12-27,size,I went true to size and that worked well.
13810,323,293,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,You feel super fast in these shoes. The Hyperdunk 2017 is one of the top performers of 2017
13811,323,486,9.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,I am a big fan of the comfort and amazing traction of the FlyKnit version of the Hyperdunk 2017.
13812,323,6,8.7,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"Overall, I can highly recommend this shoe for players of every position. Me, as a guard, I love this shoe as I get decent impact protection and a great court feel!"
13813,323,86,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,The Nike React Hyperdunk 2017 is by far one of the most solid shoes I’ve played in this year
13814,323,522,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"HD2017 has taken the top Hyperdunk spot. Better traction than previous Hyperdunks, better cushioning than the 2012-14 version, great fit, good stability and excellent containment… what more do you want?"
13815,323,32,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, this is a really good shoe. Good traction, nice material and solid lockdown. Support could have been a little better. At $160 it is a little expensive."
13816,323,45,8.5,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"Amazing traction, good support and the addition of React cushioning is welcome. I like shoes you can just put on, and they don't get in the way."
13817,323,615,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Nike Hyperdunk 2017 Flyknit isn’t a bad shoe. The cushion isn’t what I expected, but it’s tolerable. The lateral containment wasn’t the best, but it won’t keep me from hooping in these again."
13818,323,649,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I’d say the React Hyperdunk was disappointing. It is a hard shoe to recommend when better options are available at all price points.

13823,323,486,10.0,2017-12-27,traction,I feel like someone took a glue stick and went over the bottom of my shoes!
13824,323,6,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,Traction is phenomenal and collects very little dust.
13825,323,86,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The outsole did take some time to break-in but afterwards, it’s amazing — especially that extended outrigger."
13826,323,522,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Almost Kobe IX level.. almost.
13827,323,32,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction is phenomenal on clean courts, but on dusty courts you need to wipe frequently."
13828,323,45,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,I absolutely loved the traction!
13829,323,615,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction was so good I was on the court stopping on a dime when I didn’t have to.
13830,323,649,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,I found the traction to be first class in every regard.
13831,323,293,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Good amount of impact protection and very responsive, but not very bouncy."
13832,323,486,8.0,2017-12-27,cushion,The Rect cushioning felt really nice playing in it.
13833,323,6,8.5,2017-12-27,cushion,"I can't complain too much, decent bounce and impact protection."
13834,323,86,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,A big guy like myself — someone who has a heavy in-step and lands hard — requires something more cushioned
13835,323,522,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Overall I really liked the full length React foam set up even if it isn’t the most fun feeling or bounciest set up.
13836,323,32,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,React Cushioning feels pretty nice but I wasn't blown away by the performance. Feels like a more firm and responsive Lunarlon.
13837,323,45,8.0,2017-12-27,cushion,Responsive and firm cushioning with decent impact protection.
13838,323,615,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The React foam was stiff, and it had no life — it was super dead."
13839,323,649,6.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"I found React to feel lifeless, and lacking in almost all areas."
13840,323,293,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Super soft and no break-in period.
13841,323,486,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,The FlyKnit version is really comfortable.
13842,323,6,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,The full FlyKnit upper feels really comfortable and gives you a nice 1:1 fit.
13843,323,86,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The upper is constructed entirely of Flyknit and it’s super comfortable around the foot
13844,323,522,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,I had no issues at all with the materials.
13845,323,32,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"The materials feel really nice, no break in needed!"
13846,323,615,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The materials are extremely comfortable.
13847,323,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Lockdown and support was good, but the upper is a bit too stretchy for hard cuts."
13848,323,486,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"Really nice containment, no heel slippage -reminded me of the Kobe 9."
13849,323,6,8.5,2017-12-27,support,I had slight problems on very hard lateral cuts because the FlyKnit stretches and doesn't provide as much containment as the mesh version.
13850,323,86,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"The support comes directly from the fit, and the fit was wonderful once fully broken in"
13851,323,522,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The HD does a great job with stability thanks to the pods along the lateral side of the shoe.
13852,323,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Support and lockdown are pretty solid.
13853,323,45,8.0,2017-12-27,support,"The support was good, but not the greatest.That's because the FlyKnit does sacrifice in this area in exchange for more comfort."
13854,323,615,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"Too much lateral movement, other than that, everything else was good."
13855,323,649,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"The heel is solidly stabilized thanks to these elements, and the aforementioned tongue padding offers enough protection to further lock the heel in from the top."
13856,323,293,10.0,2017-01-01,fit,The fit was just incredible.
13857,323,6,8.5,2017-12-27,fit,"The materials give you a nice 1:1 fit, but with my wide feet I had a slightly uncomfortable break-in period."
13858,323,86,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,One of my favorite aspects of the shoe is the fit
13859,323,522,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,I was very pleased with the fit of the HD17.
13860,323,45,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The FlyKnit upper molds around your feet very well.
13861,323,615,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Once the Flyknit broke in, the materials loosened up, causing some dead space in the toebox."
13862,323,293,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,Durability for outdoor play isn't the best.
13863,323,6,1,2017-12-27,width,The FlyKnit version of this shoe runs very narrow.
13864,323,522,2,2017-01-01,width,Wide footers will want to go up half a size.
13865,323,522,3,2017-01-01,size,A little short length wise but true to size overall.
13866,323,45,3,2017-12-27,size,True to size.
13867,324,486,9.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,I think the Kobe AD Mid is the best Kobe shoe out right now! Better than the NXT or the regular AD.
13868,324,32,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, the Kobe AD Mid is a solid performer with phenomenal traction, nice cushioning and solid support. The suede material is a little too stiff for my liking, but hopefully, future releases with a Jacquard or Flyknit upper will fix this issue."
13869,324,6,8.9,2017-12-27,expert_overall,The Kobe AD is an amazing performer but I just wish they had used a different upper material.
13870,324,522,8.6,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"I think the Kobe AD Mid is an excellent all-around performer on the court. Not surprisingly, it’s one of my top five for the year due to its great overall performance."
13871,324,45,8.5,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"The Kobe AD Mid is a beautiful and comfortable shoe that unfortunately suffers from bad ventilation and a small amount of heel slippage. Otherwise, I really like this shoe!"
13872,324,293,8.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"This shoe feels very different than any other Kobe shoe I ever played in. It provides less responsiveness and court feel than other Kobes. It seems like after his retirement, Kobe wants a little more cushioning and a more ""old school"" vibe from his shoes."
13873,324,221,8.2,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"This is a very well performing shoe but there are no standout features. Great pickup for Kobe fans, but there are cheaper shoes that perform just as well."
13874,324,33,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,The shoe plays and performs really well. Traction was awesome and the cushion was solid — especially for guards. Ventilation and material quality are where the Kobe AD Mid’s could improve.
13875,324,615,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,The Kobe AD Mid is a beautiful shoe. The only real complaint I have is with the lacing system digging into my foot.
13876,324,480,7.6,2021-12-16,user_overall,"Traction was good and cushion was good, but it bottomed out quickly and hurt my feet on heavier impacts. The materials are really stiff and thick, and they gave me blisters. The ankle support was also really bad. If you're gonna buy Kobe's, get a nicer pair, not these."
13877,324,376,9.0,2023-02-05,user_overall,"The perfect outdoor shoe, will last ages unless you get gum rubber or translucent outsole"
13878,324,741,9.0,2023-03-18,user_overall,"Awesome shoe, wore down pretty quickly when played outdoors but indoors it was flawless"
13879,324,753,8.4,2022-12-05,user_overall,
13880,324,754,9.0,2024-05-28,user_overall,
13881,324,486,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,The traction pattern is excellent!
13882,324,32,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction is super squeaky. On these, that is a good thing! On dusty courts, the traction pattern is not ideal."
13883,324,6,9.5,2017-12-27,traction,The traction is beastly!
13884,324,522,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,The traction is excellent and just outside the elite group.
13885,324,45,10.0,2017-12-27,traction,This traction is beastly!
13886,324,293,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"On a clean court, the traction is superb, but the traction pattern collects a lot of dust."
13887,324,221,8.0,2017-12-27,traction,"The traction pattern is pretty tight and picks up a lot of dust. After a significant break-in period, the traction got the job done."
13888,324,33,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,This sh*t was beastly!
13889,324,615,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Traction was designed to be a beast and that it was!
13890,324,486,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,I am a big fan of the Lunarlon cushioning. Great balance between impact protection and court feel.
13891,324,32,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,I really like the Lunarlon in the front and Zoom Air in the heel setup.
13892,324,6,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,Full-length Lunarlon with Zoom in the heel gets the job done. Decent impact protection and good court feel.
13893,324,522,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,"The Lunarlon in the ADM feels great from heel to toe with a nice Zoom bag in the heel and provides a nice balance of court feel, impact protection, and bounce."
13894,324,45,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,The cushioning setup feels really nice!
13895,324,293,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Full-length lunarlon feels super nice. Good impact protection but a little less court feel than what we are used to from the Kobe line.
13896,324,221,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,The cushioning setup is very well balanced and should work for all types of players.
13897,324,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The midsole is Lunarlon and the heel features a large volume Zoom Air unit. You will not be disappointed with this setup.
13898,324,615,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The impact protection in the heel was excellent, and some very nice Lunarlon cushioned the rest of the foot."
13899,324,32,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,The synthetic suede upper is pretty stiff and doesn't feel as nice as a Flyknit or Jacquard.
13900,324,6,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,"The materials feel cheap, the tongue could have used more padding and the ventilation is pretty bad."
13901,324,522,7.0,2017-12-27,materials,The materials Nike chose just look and feel unfinished.
13902,324,45,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,"The mesh materials feel like Nubuck which is nice, but the breathability is pretty horrible."
13903,324,293,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,The material is very firm in the beginning but becomes comfortable pretty quickly.
13904,324,221,7.0,2017-12-27,materials,"Fit and comfort of the materials are above average, but ventilation and durability are horrible."
13905,324,33,5.0,2017-01-01,materials,"For a $150 shoe, a $150 signature shoe at that, the materials used should have been much nicer."
13906,324,615,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,I think Nike could have done better in this category. Ventilation is bad - this material is like a sauna.
13907,324,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Support and lockdown are solid.
13908,324,6,9.0,2017-12-27,support,No heel slippage or side-to-side movement. External heel counter and interior heel padding lock you in like crazy.
13909,324,522,9.0,2017-12-27,support,Stability and support are excellent with a flat outsole and large outrigger.
13910,324,45,7.0,2017-12-27,support,The support wasn't as good as I hoped it to be as I experienced some heel slippage.
13911,324,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Firm upper, great lateral containment, very nice outrigger that provides a lot of stability."
13912,324,221,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"Flat base, internal heel cup, and external outrigger provide great support."
13913,324,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The Kobe AD Mid uses the traditional heel counter and lateral outrigger that we’ve all come to know and love.
13914,324,615,7.0,2017-01-01,support,A broad base with a small outrigger keep your foot from rolling and an internal heel counter holds your foot in place.
13915,324,486,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The overall fit is a strong point of this shoe.
13916,324,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,There was some back-to-front slipping in the shoe because I couldn't tie it tight enough.
13917,324,6,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The fit is really nice.
13918,324,522,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,I had no movement side to side and no heel slip from the get-go.
13919,324,293,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,"I had a little too much dead space in the toe area, other than that the fit was okay."
13920,324,221,8.0,2017-12-27,fit,"Forefoot and midfoot fit are perfect, but the heel feels too small. The tongue should have used more padding,"
13921,324,33,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,Once you get your size down I don’t think you’ll have any real issues.
13922,324,615,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Lockdown was solid. However, the lacing system is too tight and caused me some discomfort."
13923,324,293,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,Outdoor use is not recommended because the rubber is super soft.
13924,324,6,2,2017-12-27,width,The Kobe AD Mid is pretty narrow.
13925,324,522,2,2017-12-27,width,Wide footers can go up half a size but expect some extra length.
13926,324,293,2,2017-01-01,width,Fits slightly narrow.
13927,324,6,3,2017-12-27,size,"Runs true to size, but wide-footers may need to go up a size."
13928,324,522,3,2017-12-27,size,True to size.
13929,324,293,3,2017-01-01,size,Go true to size.
13930,325,293,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"A budget model that performs like a top-tier model. Traction is amazing, the cushion is okay, materials are really nice and they fit me very well. I think this is one of the best-performing Under Armour shoes out right now!"
13931,325,516,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, this is a great shoe that will work for every type of player. Good job Under Armour!"
13932,325,176,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, the Drive 4 is a decent, serviceable shoe — nothing except traction really stands out, yet the shoe is good for players at all positions."
13933,325,86,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"This shoe is for the every day, every position player and it is a solid performer. If you require more cushion like myself, then you may have to look elsewhere."
13934,325,32,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Under Armour Drive 4 is a solid hoops shoe for a low-budget price. I like them more than the Steph Curry 3 Zero. They feel lighter, are more flexible and the traction is on point. The cushioning is not a strong point but is still fairly good."
13935,325,755,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Drive 4 has some things going for it (traction) and then there are some things that need work (fit and materials). If you’re someone who plays low to the ground, prefers a stable ride and has a wide foot, these are going to be great for you."
13936,325,729,8.0,2023-04-28,user_overall,Herringbone pattern is so good for outdoor use. Traction is amazing but cushion is hard especially forefoot. Good for wide footers. It is not fit to me.
13937,325,293,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction is really, really nice."
13938,325,516,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Herringbone traction held up on every surface I played on.
13939,325,176,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction is going to bite and not let go.
13940,325,86,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction on the UA Drive 4 is bonkers.
13941,325,32,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction grips really, really well and is one of the strong points of these shoes."
13942,325,755,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The rubber compound could’ve been a little tackier but that didn’t keep these from working on virtually every floor condition you can think of.
13943,325,293,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The cushioning is super stiff and very responsive. Impact protection is solid, but not made for big and heavy guys."
13944,325,516,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushion setup wasn't mind-blowing but it sure as hell got the job done. A perfect combination of impact protection and responsiveness.
13945,325,176,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Micro G in the heel feels nice, but the cushioning in the forefoot feels dead."
13946,325,86,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"For my game, I needed a little bit more protection."
13947,325,32,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushioning is pretty thin and not very responsive. I wouldn't recommend these for highflyers or bigger players.
13948,325,755,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Under Armour could’ve and should’ve used full-length MicroG, but instead it only used it in the heel."
13949,325,293,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Materials feel a little plasticky but are very comfortable.
13950,325,516,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,Not much to say about the materials - I can't complain.
13951,325,176,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Overall, not much new for the Drive 4, but all the material blend together for an interesting shoe."
13952,325,86,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,The materials don’t exactly conform to your foot so it makes the fit semi-sloppy.
13953,325,32,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Materials are really nice and soft, only the ankle collar was a little too stiff and restrictive in the beginning."
13954,325,755,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,The materials aren’t terrible but they aren’t amazing either.
13955,325,293,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Good ankle support and lockdown.
13956,325,516,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"The bootie-style upper and internal heel counter keep your feet locked down. Overall, the support is great and almost as good as the traction!"
13957,325,176,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Support is really good and makes the shoe safe for any position.
13958,325,86,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The shoe does a pretty decent job in terms of handling itself on-court.
13959,325,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"Support and lockdown are pretty solid, containment is good."
13960,325,755,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Drive 4 does a solid job keeping you on your feet thanks to its wide base and low to the ground cushioning.
13961,325,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,I really enjoyed the fit.
13962,325,176,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,Nothing that makes the shoe unplayable. There are just better options if fit is your number one priority.
13963,325,86,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The shoe fits decent, even for a wide-footer like myself, but I just didn’t feel as secure as I’d have liked — even when laced super tight."
13964,325,755,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,There was a ton of dead space towards the front of the shoe and I just couldn’t get the materials to snap to the front of my foot the way I wanted them to.
13965,325,293,100.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,The traction is pretty hard and thick and should last outdoors.
13966,326,33,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Outside of the lacking cushioning the Jordan Super.Fly 2017 is so close to being perfect it’s kind of scary,"
13967,326,86,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Jordan Super.Fly 2017 was an absolute delight to ball in.  If you’re okay with the firmness of React cushioning and enjoy a low profile on-court ride, this has you covered with traction, lockdown, and stability."
13968,326,293,8.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"It's a good performer made for bigger dudes. Very durable because of the strong materials and hard rubber. However, I wouldn't recommend them for a shifty guard."
13969,326,6,8.4,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"The Super.Fly 2017 is a decent shoe, but I would rather go with the Nike Hyperdunk 2017 as it comes with the same technology but more premium materials and better-feeling cushioning."
13970,326,45,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Some things are good, some aren't. This shoe doesn't quite get my approval."
13971,326,729,8.6,2023-04-28,user_overall,"So durable shoe also low profile model good for shifty guards. Very durable materials since 2017 for me and amazing traction. But react cushioning has no reaction on court. Transluscent pattern bad for outdoor use but the all models rubber is pretty hard, so outdoor use should be okay. Finally support pattern is so good guys."
13972,326,33,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Beastly! Indoors or outdoors, this traction setup is awesome."
13973,326,86,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction was awesome and consistent.
13974,326,293,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"After breaking it in it gets really nice. On a dusty court, I had to wipe a fair amount."
13975,326,6,8.5,2017-12-27,traction,The traction needed a little break-in time but was excellent after that.
13976,326,45,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction pattern was pretty good, but nothing incredible."
13977,326,33,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The new React cushioning has no reaction while you’re on-court. No bounce. No feedback.
13978,326,86,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushion lacks the effective bounce I expected.
13979,326,293,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The cushion is nothing crazy, impact protection is fair."
13980,326,6,8.0,2017-12-27,cushion,I am not a big fan of the very firm React cushioning.
13981,326,45,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Cushioning gets the job done, but nothing more."
13982,326,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,There are different material options and they are all fantastic!
13983,326,86,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Materials give you not only a beautiful look but nice durability.
13984,326,293,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Materials look super premium, but they are rather bulky."
13985,326,6,8.5,2017-12-27,materials,The Suede/Nubuck upper of my colorway is a little stiff at first but feels very premium later on.
13986,326,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Everything you need and expect is featured here.
13987,326,86,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The support on the Super.Fly 2017 was good.
13988,326,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Strong materials are very supportive and you get a little ankle support from the mid cut.
13989,326,6,9.0,2017-12-27,support,No heel slippage or movement in the footbed. I also liked the Achilles pillows that add to the comfort in the heel area of this shoe.
13990,326,45,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Thanks to flywire and two pods on the Achilles heel the shoe is very supportive
13991,326,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The heel fit and lockdown are noticeably exceptional and it’s really comfortable.
13992,326,86,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Your feet feel completely molded into the shoe.
13993,326,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The lockdown of the fit is great
13994,326,6,8.0,2017-12-27,fit,"Works very well for narrow feet, but if you have wide feet, this shoe is probably not for you."
13995,326,45,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,The lockdown was pretty good but I had problems with lateral movements.
13996,326,293,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,"The rubber is pretty hard, so outdoor use should be okay!"
13997,326,293,2,2017-01-01,width,They fit really snug.
13998,326,6,1,2017-12-27,width,They are really narrow.
13999,326,293,4,2017-01-01,size,Runs a little long.
14000,326,6,3,2017-12-27,size,Go true to size.
14001,327,293,9.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Crazy good performance, looks dope, premium materials. Overall, an amazing shoe, get it!"
14002,327,615,9.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,The adidas Crazy Explosive 2017 Primeknit is a great shoe! I love this thing like crazy and it is by far my favorite hoop shoe of 2017 so far. It’s number one in my rotation and I’m pretty sure it will be in many of yours as well.
14003,327,176,9.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Improved fit and killer cushioning should put the Crazy Explosive 2017 PK on everyone’s radar this year if you play basketball. Grab this shoe if you need traction for indoor courts, #Boostislife cushioning, a locked-in fit, and quick support."
14004,327,486,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,Feels like playing in a sock with good traction and Boost cushioning!
14005,327,6,9.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,Great shoe! If you can - get the solid rubber version as it offers slightly improved traction.
14006,327,45,9.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"I am really happy with the Crazy Explosive 2017. Crazy comfortable, great cushioning and traction."
14007,327,522,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I think most players will enjoy the Crazy Explosive 2017 because it does everything well if not great and really gives the player an excellent one to one fit with a low to ground yet well cushioned ride.
14008,327,32,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I prefer the 2016 version over the Crazy Explosive 2017. The traction is identical, cushioning is a lot firmer and less plush, lockdown and support are a little better and the materials are a lot stiffer and less comfortable. Overall, still a very solid shoe."
14009,327,756,9.7,2022-10-08,user_overall,THIS SHOES IS A BEAST! it's good for outdoors and indoors! It doesn't really pick up dust easily
14010,327,757,9.2,2023-01-06,user_overall,Traction bites hard and it's a very cushiony shoe. Would buy if you can find any.
14011,327,15,8.7,2022-11-17,user_overall,
14012,327,496,9.0,2022-03-20,user_overall,
14013,327,293,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Traction is really good!
14014,327,615,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Traction is phenomenal on clean as well as dusty courts.
14015,327,176,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"On clean, indoor courts, enjoy. Seriously, for that surface, this is one of the top patterns, perhaps ever."
14016,327,486,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"I didn't have any problems with the traction, performs really well."
14017,327,6,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,The solid rubber works really well and picks up less dust than the translucent version.
14018,327,45,8.0,2017-12-27,traction,"The traction gets the job done. I didn't have to wipe a lot, even on dustier courts."
14019,327,522,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,Works great on clean floors but requires a fair amount of wiping on dusty floors.
14020,327,32,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction is not the best compared to other shoes, but it is still solid. Excellent on clean courts, but on dusty courts you will need to wipe a lot."
14021,327,293,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Caged full-length boost is really plush. Overall an amazing setup, maybe the best available."
14022,327,615,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushion is beast-mode. I love it!
14023,327,176,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,2017 PK is quicker on-foot and on-court than the 2016 with the same great impact protection and energy return.
14024,327,486,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Boost Cushioning is really nice!
14025,327,6,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,You can't go wrong with full-length boost.
14026,327,45,10.0,2017-12-27,cushion,"Boost is just incredible. Comfortable, super responsive and great court feel - how is that even possible?"
14027,327,522,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The set up feels ever so slightly firmer than last year’s which is great for me
14028,327,32,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Boost feels really stiff compared to the last years model.
14029,327,293,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Forged Primeknit is a little stiff in the beginning but gets really soft after breaking in.  Materials are great and super premium, but a little too stiff for my liking."
14030,327,615,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"I preferred the materials of the previous Crazy Explosive model, but overall, I still love this setup."
14031,327,176,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"The knit is flexible and form-fitting and doesn’t stretch too much while playing, which is great."
14032,327,486,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Forged PrimeKnit is thicker and provides more support than last years thinner PrimeKnit.
14033,327,6,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,PrimeKnit upper is very comfortable and looks great.
14034,327,522,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,Doesn't feel as soft or flexible as last years. No issues here for me but it takes a few runs to get the upper to break in.
14035,327,32,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,Forged PrimeKnit is a lot more stiff and solid compared to the 2016 version.
14036,327,293,10.0,2017-01-01,support,"No heel slippage, very good lockdown and support."
14037,327,615,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Support was great.
14038,327,176,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"The wide forefoot keeps you upright on lateral moves. The cage on the lateral side keeps the foot contained over the footbed, and the stiffer knit holds true on push-offs and plants."
14039,327,6,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"Big heel counter, no side-to-side movement and lateral outrigger that provides additional stability."
14040,327,45,8.0,2017-12-27,support,"Even though the PrimeKnit is backed by TPU, the upper is not as supportive as I'd like it to be."
14041,327,522,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Stability is once again excellent on the Crazy Explosive thanks a large flat outsole, low ride and infinity shank."
14042,327,32,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Support and lockdown is really good.
14043,327,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The snug fit is really, really nice."
14044,327,615,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,This year we now have five eyelets and everything from the forefoot to heel was contained nicely so I had no issues.
14045,327,176,10.0,2017-01-01,fit,Perfect. Nothing else should be said!
14046,327,6,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The 1:1 fit of the one piece bootie is super nice.
14047,327,45,10.0,2017-12-27,fit,The fit is super comfortable because of the soft PrimeKnit upper. One of the most comfortable shoes I ever played in!
14048,327,522,10.0,2017-01-01,fit,The fit on the CE 17 is fantastic and really gives a one to one sock like feel.
14049,327,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,Fit is really comfortable except in one location. The TPU outrigger on the lateral side caused a lot of pain in my pinkie toe.
14050,327,293,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,"Durability might be better compared to last year, but I still don't think it will be good outdoors."
14051,327,45,50.0,2017-12-27,outdoor,I think the solid rubber will hold up outdoors.
14052,327,522,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,The Crazy Explosive is still prone to peeling and wear so not really recommended for outdoor use.
14053,327,486,2,2017-01-01,width,"Slightly narrow, but not very narrow."
14054,327,522,2,2017-01-01,width,Wide footers should go up half a size maybe even a full size because these run tight.
14055,327,486,3,2017-01-01,size,This is one Adidas shoe that fits true to size
14056,327,522,2,2017-01-01,size,Wide footers should go up half a size maybe even a full size because these run tight.
14057,328,293,8.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,This shoe is pretty nice and works well for guards who need a responsive shoe. Feels a little like a low-top Kyrie 2 with nicer materials and worse traction.
14058,328,486,8.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,Overall this is a solid shoe that has signature model-like qualities at a retail price of $100 - you can't really beat that!
14059,328,45,8.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"Overall, this is a pretty good shoe. Nothing crazy, but very good value for the money!"
14060,328,615,7.4,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"While the Nike Zoom Shift is aesthetically pleasing, the inconsistent traction and the brick-like cushion makes the shoe very unpleasant on-court."
14061,328,293,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,The traction was good and worked fairly well on dusty courts.
14062,328,486,8.0,2017-12-27,traction,The outsole wraps around the side of the shoe similar to the Kyrie 3.
14063,328,45,7.0,2017-12-27,traction,"On clean courts you are alright, but on dusty courts you are slipping all time."
14064,328,615,5.0,2017-12-27,traction,Traction is very inconsistent and very frustrating.
14065,328,293,7.0,2017-12-27,cushion,"The cushioning is really stiff and responsive, but impact protection is minimal."
14066,328,486,8.0,2017-12-27,cushion,Forefoot Zoom similar to the PG1.
14067,328,45,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,Once they are broken in the cushion feels very nice. I really like the setup of Phylon foam with a Zoom unit in the forefoot.
14068,328,615,5.0,2017-12-27,cushion,Can you say nonexistent?
14069,328,293,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,Decent materials for a budget model.
14070,328,486,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,The lightweight mesh upper is a good combination of comfort and breathability.
14071,328,45,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,The materials are very breathable and durable.
14072,328,615,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,he best features of the Nike Zoom Shift are its materials.
14073,328,293,8.0,2017-12-27,support,Very good lockdown and lateral containment. The outrigger is minimal though.
14074,328,45,9.0,2017-12-27,support,The support is probably the best feature of this shoe.
14075,328,615,9.0,2017-12-27,support,The support mainly comes from the fit.
14076,328,293,8.0,2017-12-27,fit,No heel slippage or dead space.
14077,328,45,7.0,2017-12-27,fit,This one-piece construction is a nightmare to get on.
14078,328,615,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,There is no getting out of the shoe until you take them off.
14079,328,293,0.0,2017-12-27,outdoor,I wouldn't recommend outdoor use.
14080,328,486,2,2017-12-27,width,The shoe is a little narrow in the beginning.
14081,328,45,1,2017-12-27,width,These are super tight in the beginning.
14082,328,486,3,2017-12-27,size,I recommend going true to size.
14083,328,45,2,2017-12-27,size,I recommend going a size up.
14084,329,615,9.3,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, the Nike Lebron Soldier 11 is the bomb, I love it! I have no complaints about it whatsoever. This shoe jumped up to #2 on my rotation, that's how much I liked it."
14085,329,33,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"While traction could still use a little bit of work, the cushion is immensely better than the last go-around. Suitable for every position on the floor and a great option for players than want a little bit of everything with their on-court shoes."
14086,329,293,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"A well-rounded shoe that provides a ton of support and lockdown. Traction is decent. Not recommended for shifty guards because it feels a little bulky, but a very good shoe for bigger players who value impact protection, lockdown and support."
14087,329,522,8.6,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"Although the Soldier XI doesn’t do anything extremely well, it’s a very solid shoe all the way around."
14088,329,649,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The LeBron Soldier 11 in many ways is “just” the LeBron Soldier 10.1. That’s really not a bad thing though, as the Soldier 10 was a great shoe, and the 11 improves on almost every aspect of its design with very minimal compromise."
14089,329,486,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Good for what it does, doesn't quite get the Kick Genius stamp of approval but definitely gets the job done. The best Lebron Soldier I ever played in for sure."
14090,329,755,8.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Nike LeBron Soldier 11 is a very versatile sneaker. Any guard or slashing forward will find something that they like. It is a solid option both indoors and on the black top, yet it isn’t quite “elite.” Had Nike went all out on the cushioning and made it a little more stable, it would have easily been a top-tier performer."
14091,329,32,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"It's a really, really solid shoe. I loved the cushioning and responsiveness, the support and lockdown were really solid, but traction was very inconsistent. Not my go-to shoes but definitely in the rotation."
14092,329,201,8.0,2023-09-23,user_overall,"this shoe has the best support I've probably ever played in. The cushion is there but felt very little. the traction in one word is well, inconsistent. On a dusty court you're slipping and sliding, and on a clean court you either have amazing grip or you're still slipping. This shoe is a bit bulky and I recommend for larger forwards or wing players."
14093,329,758,9.6,2023-07-06,user_overall,"Great for a bouncy wing. Have had 3 pair of these for 5+ years and they are all in great shape with no issues, except velcro failing."
14094,329,576,9.4,2022-02-07,user_overall,Amazing shoes… have beautiful strap… confortable..

14097,329,615,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,After the shoes broke in the traction was really awesome.
14098,329,33,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"While the traction on the Nike LeBron Soldier 11 isn’t bad, it isn’t as good as it should be."
14099,329,293,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction is very nice on clean courts, but picks up a fair amount of dust."
14100,329,522,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,It has a surprising bite and held up even on dusty floors without much wiping at all.
14101,329,649,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction of the Soldier 11, on the other had, is actually good. You’ll have to swipe occasionally, like almost every shoe, but after a very brief break-in period, the grip was squeaky and secure."
14102,329,486,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,If you are in dustier setting your are going to slide all over the place. On clean courts traction is really good.
14103,329,755,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction on the LeBron Soldier 11 is surprisingly solid but not very consistent.
14104,329,32,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction was pretty inconsistent. Good on clean courts, but horrible on really dusty courts. Even Lebron slipped in these during the finals."
14105,329,615,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Protruding Nike Zoom Units in the forefoot and heel felt amazing.
14106,329,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The Zoom Air units are pretty damn big which means impact protection is solid overall.
14107,329,293,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,You get a ton of response because the cushion is pretty firm.
14108,329,522,8.0,2017-12-27,cushion,"There is a decent amount of bounce to the Zoom but still not as lively as my standard, the Soldier VI."
14109,329,649,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The dual-Zoom bag setup is better implemented than in the Soldier 10 and provides a noticeable improvement.
14110,329,755,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Zoom Air in both the heel and forefoot performs admirably - it just would have been so much better with full-length Zoom.
14111,329,32,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushion is pretty standard but responsiveness is great.
14112,329,615,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Materials look so nice, I don't even want to hoop in these. But breathability is not existent."
14113,329,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Materials offer the feeling of wearing a knit/woven upper but with a bit more strength.
14114,329,293,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,Materials feel better than in the Soldier 10 but are still relatively cheap.
14115,329,522,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,"Nothing fancy, just plain old mesh."
14116,329,755,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"The  suede overlay of the ""premium” version of the LeBron Soldier 11 is too nice to pass up."
14117,329,32,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,The materials are nothing special. The upper is soft and comfortable but breathability is a problem
14118,329,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Is the shoe’s fit supportive enough without laces being involved? Yes, at least for me."
14119,329,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"The upper is very supportive and doesn't stretch, lateral support is great and ankle support is decent too."
14120,329,522,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"Thanks to a low-to-the-ground ride, flat outsole and double outrigger the Lebron Soldier is very stable and supportive."
14121,329,649,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"Sculpted collar padding, along with the external heel counter and forefoot outriggers, combine to create confidence in the shoe’s stability."
14122,329,486,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The four straps gave me extra confidence while recovering from an ankle sprain.
14123,329,755,7.0,2017-01-01,support,This is the first time that I’ve ever felt like a LeBron sneaker needed more support.
14124,329,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"Lockdown is great. At times I felt a little wobbly because of the narrow base, but overall I didn't have any problems with support."
14125,329,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The shoes are a little hard to get on, lockdown on the shoe was good and once the materials are broke in a bit things started to feel secure."
14126,329,293,10.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Once you get your feet in, the straps lock down you feet really right, I love it!"
14127,329,522,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,"I had no movement side to side or front to back, no heel slip, well done Nike!"
14128,329,649,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The Soldier 11 is essentially a sock with some straps. But similar to the Soldier 10, it actually fits well."
14129,329,755,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,Out of the box these shoes have an extremely snug but comfortable fit. As time goes on the materials will soften up and you end up with a pillowy experience that feels just a bit soft.
14130,329,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,The overall comfort of the Soldier 11 is definitely an improvement over the Soldier 10 and feels pretty nice.
14131,329,293,100.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,"The rubber is pretty hard, so outdoor play should be okay."
14132,329,293,3,2017-01-01,width,Doesn't feel as wide as previous Soldier Models.
14133,329,293,3,2017-01-01,size,Go true to size.
14134,329,522,3,2017-12-27,size,True to size for everyone.
14135,330,32,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall the shoe is very similar to the KD 9. I like the firmer cushioning, the soft and flexible upper, but the support could be better."
14136,330,45,8.6,2017-12-27,expert_overall,The KD10 is a great shoe overall but there are some downfalls like the lacking of lateral support.
14137,330,293,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I like the shoe a lot! If you are not looking to do heavy lateral cuts or be really shifty then this is a great shoe! Very comfortable fit and great cushion make these perfect when you want to give your legs some extra comfort.
14138,330,176,8.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Compared to the KD9, the Zoom is toned down, for good and bad. The materials are definitely improved. The looks — let’s face it, this is a beautiful shoe. But the traction slid a little and the overall playability seemed a step back from the KD9."
14139,330,86,8.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,The KD10 just misses being a great shoe due to minor flaws in construction and traction — but they don’t deter it from being a good performance shoe.
14140,330,615,8.3,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"Overall, the KD10 is a decent shoe, it just not as good as the KD9."
14141,330,6,8.1,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"Overall, this is a good shoe. Unfortunately, traction and support keep it from being great."
14142,330,33,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Nike KD 9 was an amazing shoe. The Nike KD 10 was almost an amazing shoe. It looks amazing, but it suffered in a few areas due to the bold new design."
14143,330,486,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,Overall the KD 10 performs solid in all categories. There is nothing phenomenal but on the flip side there is also nothing bad.
14144,330,497,7.8,2022-01-13,user_overall,"The Nike KD10 was definitely not my favourite shoe, but it definitely wasn’t the worst. It is mostly suitable for forwards. The traction was decent on a clean court, but on dust, it was very sloppy. The cushion was okay, but it didn’t have all too much court feel. I also found the shoe a little stiff. The support was very sloppy tho, and my foot would always slide out the footbed. Ankle support wasn’t great either. The materials were okay and a little breathable, but the laces were inconvenient."
14145,330,760,8.4,2023-01-30,user_overall,"I think the cushioning is very good but has little durability because it broke very easy, and this didn’t only happened to me, my friends happened too."

14150,330,45,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,I absolutely love the traction!
14151,330,293,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,Nothing incredible or groundbreaking but traction is good.
14152,330,176,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"I never experienced any straight slipping in moves or game play, but traction didn't bite the way I like it."
14153,330,86,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"While the outsole design did provide multi-directional coverage, the grooves picked up dust — especially on the forefoot and heel points"
14154,330,615,8.0,2017-12-27,traction,"The traction is inconsistent, works well on clean courts, but on dusty courts, you will need to wipe a lot."
14155,330,6,7.5,2017-12-27,traction,"The traction is just okay. On dusty courts, I was sliding a lot."
14156,330,33,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction on both of my KD 10s just didn’t work out for me.
14157,330,486,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction is solid.
14158,330,32,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Cushioning is a bit more firm compared to the KD9, but I like the more responsive setup."
14159,330,45,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,Springy is the word that comes to mind.
14160,330,293,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Good impact protection, super bouncy, great heel to toe transition but you lose a little court feel."
14161,330,176,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"This is the way Nike Zoom should feel, all day, every day."
14162,330,86,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Full-length Articulated Max Zoom Air. The ride was responsive without taking away from court feel but there is also plenty of impact protection
14163,330,615,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,This time the cushioning is a bit firmer compared to the KD9.
14164,330,6,8.5,2017-12-27,cushion,Full-length Zoom - but it doesn't feel anything like the KD9. This time the cushion is firmer and more responsive.
14165,330,33,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushion offers the best impact protection Nike currently has available.
14166,330,486,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Max cushioning of full length zoom, but I prefer more court feel."
14167,330,32,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Flyknit upper is super soft and flexible
14168,330,45,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,The reinforced FlyKnit is very comfortable.
14169,330,293,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Flyknit materials are very premium, top notch!"
14170,330,176,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Soft, pliable, comfy, and form-fitting, the upper of the KD is what the future of Flyknit in basketball should be."
14171,330,86,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Flyknit materials are everything when done correctly and here, from heel to forefoot, it’s Flyknit errrry-thang!"
14172,330,615,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,"Materials work, but I liked the KD9 materials much better."
14173,330,6,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,The full FlyKnit upper feels amazing.
14174,330,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"I love the materials that were used on the Nike KD 10, I just don’t love how they performed."
14175,330,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"Lockdown is really good but can be a little painful.  On hard cuts, I felt the shoe roll over a little bit."
14176,330,45,7.0,2017-12-27,support,The upper material is too soft and doesn't provide enough lateral support.
14177,330,293,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"Front to back was okay, but lateral support isn't great"
14178,330,176,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"There are no serious structures to prevent rollover, just a good fit, wide base, and solid heel counter."
14179,330,86,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"I had an issue with the shoe: one of my lace loops ripped. Apart from that, the containment was decent."
14180,330,6,7.0,2017-12-27,support,"This is probably the most disappointing aspect of the shoe. Great heel support, but the FlyKnit in the forefoot doesn't offer a lot of containment."
14181,330,33,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"Despite the base of the shoe being a solid platform, it just wasn’t enough to say these are cutting it in the support department."
14182,330,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,Way easier to put the shoe on compared to the KD 9.
14183,330,45,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The foot is held in nicely.
14184,330,176,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The fit of the shoe is almost perfect.
14185,330,86,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The fit of the shoe is fine but intense lateral cuts and heavy rotations on-court may cause some instabilities.
14186,330,615,8.0,2017-12-27,fit,"If you pull the laces really tight, the fit is pretty good."
14187,330,6,8.5,2017-12-27,fit,The Flyknit upper provides a nice 1:1 fit and the KD10 is much easier to put on compared to the KD9.
14188,330,33,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,Heel lockdown was great but the midfoot lockdown was atrocious.
14189,330,486,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,Flyknit is really soft but the fit is a little less snug than the KD9 elite.
14190,330,293,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,Outdoor use is not recommended at all.
14191,330,293,4,2017-01-01,size,I would suggest going down half a size
14192,330,6,4,2017-12-27,size,They run slightly long.
14193,330,486,4,2017-01-01,size,I would recommend to go half a size down.
14194,331,33,9.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Is the Curry 3ZER0 leaps and bounds better than the Curry 3? No. However, the cushion feels more refined and offers a better balance between stability and protection.  If you’re a guard or a shooter and plan on trying out the Curry 3ZER0 I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised."
14195,331,522,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Out of the three Curry models released this year, I’d put the Low first, the 3Zero slightly behind at second and then the Mid. The Curry 3 Zero is a more minimal shoe that doesn't rely on bells and whistles or tech mumbo-jumbo, which I personally enjoy."
14196,331,6,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,For a $120 this is not a bad shoe! Really good on-court performer and I like the fit much better compared to the original Curry 3. I just wish they hadn't downgraded the material from Threadborne to Mesh.
14197,331,32,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The SC 3Zero is a solid second line shoe. Overall, I wasn't a big fan of the new cushioning setup and the inconsistent traction. However, I did like the improved ankle support."
14198,331,293,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Just like the Curry 3, nothing special. I wasn't happy with the fit and the traction. Let's hope for an improved Curry 4."
14199,331,439,8.6,2023-04-24,user_overall,"These shoes I got were previously owned,but the lock down and outrigger was something else as you never have to worry about rolling your ankle while playing basketball in them."

14203,331,33,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,Herringbone and solid rubber — the things that make for some beastly traction no matter the court condition.
14204,331,522,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Great on clean floors but will require wiping when dusty.
14205,331,6,8.5,2017-01-01,traction,Traction is very good on clean or dusty courts.
14206,331,32,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"On clean courts you are ready to go, on mildly dusty courts you will need to wipe from time to time."

14208,331,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,If you wanted a cushion that balances stability and comfort then this is the setup for you.
14209,331,522,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Overall there is no real difference in cushioning so if you didn’t like the cushioning on the 2.5 or 3, you won’t like these either.  Personally, I find these work well for me and my game but to each their own."
14210,331,6,8.5,2017-01-01,cushion,Micro-G cushion is a lot more forgiving than the firmer Curry 3 Charged cushioning.
14211,331,32,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushioning setup is a little stiffer than the original Curry 3. I personally wasn't a fan and would have liked a little more bounce.
14212,331,293,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The cushioning is very, very stiff. The insole is nice, impact protection is decent."
14213,331,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"This setup is very durable and worked just fine on-court. However, some break-in time is required."
14214,331,522,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,Sacrifices come in the form of the materials. Reinforced mesh is used instead of Threadborne and plastic instead of carbon fiber for the meta wing and midfoot shank.
14215,331,6,7.5,2017-01-01,materials,Materials are pretty basic.
14216,331,32,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Lightweight, flexible and breathable materials."
14217,331,293,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"After a few days, the materials become soft and comfortable."
14218,331,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The shoe’s tooling sits wide and stable — built in outrigger included.

14226,331,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,Not as comfortable as the original Curry 3. They feel really stiff in the beginning but get more comfortable after a while.
14227,331,293,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,There is so much toe room that I had to put in an additional 4mm insole.

14266,333,293,8.5,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction bites really hard on clean courts. On dusty courts, you will need to wipe a lot."

14269,333,486,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Lunarlon midsole with a Nike Zoom unit in the heel - one of my favorite setups.
14270,333,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The large volume heel Zoom Air unit coupled with a Lunarlon midsole works very well.
14271,333,522,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,I could feel the heel Zoom and Lunarlon from the get-go. Well done Nike!
14272,333,293,8.5,2017-01-01,cushion,Heel Zoom unit provides you with decent impact protection.

14274,333,701,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,I thought the cushioning setup was pretty good on these. A great balance between cushioning and court feel.
14275,333,486,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,A mixture of mesh and knit provides the best Nike has to offer.
14276,333,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The shoe is made out of a mesh textile build that is very breathable.
14277,333,522,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,No issues here but for $200 you’d think you’d get all Flyknit.
14278,333,293,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,The materials are very nice and super soft from the get-go.
14279,333,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,You sit low to the ground so stability is great while the overall containment (from the fit) is wonderful.
14280,333,522,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Overall, I really liked the mobility of wearing a low without any fear or turning my ankle."
14281,333,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Support is very good.
14282,333,649,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Great heel lockdown and two subtle outriggers help the shoe to excel in this area.
14283,333,486,10.0,2017-01-01,fit,I don't think there is another shoe that will fit as great as this one.
14284,333,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,For those that enjoy that really snug feeling on-foot then you’ll likely enjoy the hell out of these.
14285,333,522,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,I had no movement side to side and zero heel slip. I really enjoyed the one to one fit with the NXT.
14286,333,293,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,The new lacing system is a no-go. You can't really get it to securely lock down your forefoot.
14287,333,649,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The new lacing system not only sounds great on paper but also actually works. The feel of the NXT’s upper is second to none. I wasn’t able to achieve a fit quite as snug as with traditional lacing systems, but there was still enough support that the tradeoff was well worth it in terms of comfort."
14288,333,701,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,"I had a little heel slippage, the lockdown was fine and the shoes were really comfortable."
14289,333,293,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,Outdoor use is not recommended.
14290,333,522,2,2017-01-01,width,Wide footers can go up half a size.
14291,333,293,2,2017-01-01,width,The fit is rather narrow similar to other Kobe models.
14292,333,701,2,2017-01-01,width,They are a little narrow.
14293,333,522,3,2017-01-01,size,These fit true to size lengthwise.
14294,333,293,4,2017-01-01,size,Go down half a size if you have narrow feet.
14295,333,701,3,2017-01-01,size,They're true to size.
14296,334,32,9.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,At $110 these are by far the best value performance basketball shoes available right now.
14297,334,755,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Nike PG 1 features a consistent traction experience that holds up on a wide variety of court conditions as well as a decent cushion setup that favors quick, low to the ground players. At $110, it’s worth a shot right?"
14298,334,486,8.7,2017-01-01,expert_overall,Overall I thought that shoe performed great! It's my go-to shoe right now and I will be hooping in them for a while!
14299,334,6,8.6,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"For $110, I can absolutely recommend these shoes."
14300,334,649,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The PG1 performs on a level that far exceeds its relatively low price tag.  Its cushioning and stability are top-notch, making it my favorite Nike of the season at any price."
14301,334,33,8.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I will say that the Nike PG1 is very good if you’re looking for a shoe that feels like an extension of your foot without breaking the bank.
14302,334,86,8.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The PG1 is a wonderful shoe to play in, as long as you don’t have wide feet and you can get your foot into the shoe. For a first signature model and it’s $110 price point, I think the shoe is fantastic."
14303,334,293,8.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I really like to play in the Nike PG1. Cushion and fit are nice and the traction gets good after breaking them in.  At $110 they are a real steal!
14304,334,701,8.3,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"For only $110 it  is a very, very good performance basketball sneaker.  You won't worry about sliding around, slipping on the floor, or the lockdown of the shoe. A"
14305,334,522,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, the PG1 is a great start to a new signature shoe, far better than the Kyrie 1 in my opinion. Cushioning isn’t the best or very fun but it works fine while  the rest of the shoe performs very well."
14306,334,560,10.0,2023-12-22,user_overall,"God, I miss these shoes! I wore them for 5 years, 3 on court and then 2 as normal sneakers. The flywire always felt tight and the shoe fit like a glove. They were rigid when needed, and flexed when I was on my toes. The materials used in the midsole and sole should be the gold standard for all shoes. I hope they come back as a reissue. Truly my perfect shoe."
14307,334,609,9.7,2024-07-02,user_overall,How it only 110$ i didn't expect much the first time i tried it. It was amazing! It was super responsive the cushioning was super average but soft the traction was great but not recommended for outdoor users the fit was amazing the support was good this shoe is flawless the best budget shoe in 2017 i love wearing it.
14308,334,439,9.0,2023-04-24,user_overall,"The best I have ever played with,My brother first got it from a thrift store and used It for 2 years and then gave it to my cousin for 2 years.Now I have used it for 2 years and the shoe still has top tier traction."
14309,334,496,8.7,2022-10-11,user_overall,
14310,334,765,9.0,2023-04-11,user_overall,
14311,334,32,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,These shoes grip to the floor really well.
14312,334,755,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"It isn’t quite elite, but the PG 1’s traction is just below that top tier thanks to its consistent performance on multiple surfaces."
14313,334,486,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction of the PG1 held it's own and the translucent rubber sole didn't cause me any problems.
14314,334,6,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,The traction bites really hard and I didn't have to wipe a lot.
14315,334,649,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"From my first run in the PG1, I had secure footing and was making confident movements with minimal swiping."
14316,334,33,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,The good news is that the pattern here really helps the rubber compound out and dust doesn’t stick to the pattern much.
14317,334,86,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The solid rubber outsole and traction worked above average
14318,334,293,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"I was very disappointed at first, but after a while they broke in and got really good. Dust is a problem."
14319,334,701,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction is the best aspect of the shoe.
14320,334,522,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction on the PG1 is on par with the Mamba Instinct, Kobe AD which is pretty damn good. Well done Nike!"
14321,334,32,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushioning of the forefoot zoom is by far my favorite part of this shoe because it is responsive like hell.
14322,334,755,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Can you find better value at $110? Probably, but for a signature model, it doesn’t get much better than this."
14323,334,486,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Forefoot zoom might be not enough cushion for some. But for me, this is a healthy balance between Kyrie 3 and Lebron 14.  I really can't ask for much more!"
14324,334,6,8.0,2017-12-27,cushion,I like the Zoom unit in the forefoot. Gives you a good blend of responsiveness and impact protection.
14325,334,649,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The PG1 doesn’t introduce any groundbreaking cushioning, but it incorporates the best use of standard Zoom Air in recent memory."
14326,334,33,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Some may feel the setup is a bit lackluster if they’re expecting an abundant amount of cushion, but if you are more into court feel then this will prove to be a worthy setup."
14327,334,86,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Forefoot Zoom, soft Phylon midsole, responsive court feel — that combination is definitely a setup worth taking a second look at."
14328,334,293,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"A little bit of cushion in the front, the heel is pretty much dead.  Very responsive feel."
14329,334,701,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Impact protection is just not excellent.
14330,334,522,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"At $110, I didn’t expect much in terms of Zoom and it feels decent overall but feels just like a budget Nike shoe set up to me."
14331,334,32,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,The materials are really nice and feel soft and flexible.
14332,334,755,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,The inner-bootie construction uses an extremely soft mesh/neoprene material that just feels too luxurious to be valued at $110.
14333,334,6,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,Materials are on the budget side but get the job done
14334,334,33,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,This is one of the best material options we’ve had from Nike Basketball in a long time.
14335,334,86,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,The materials here are absolutely the star of the show.
14336,334,293,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,For a budget model the materials are really good.
14337,334,522,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,It’s a nice blend of old and new school materials that really gives the feel of a much more expensive shoe.
14338,334,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Support and lockdown are excellent. The forefoot strap really locks your feet in.
14339,334,755,7.0,2017-01-01,support,
14340,334,6,9.0,2017-12-27,support,The strap provides great forefoot lockdown and there was zero heel slippage.
14341,334,649,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Lockdown was secure in all directions. Stability inspired confidence yet still allowed for optimal range of motion.
14342,334,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Gives you the feeling that you’re not just wearing a shoe, but that the shoe is part of you."
14343,334,86,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Wonderful lockdown, solid traction, responsive ride — I’d say it’s pretty supportive, especially for a first signature model that is a low-top."
14344,334,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Heel feels a bit loose because of the bootie design.
14345,334,701,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The lockdown is really good thanks to the forefoot strap.
14346,334,522,8.0,2017-01-01,support,No issues with the support at all. Stability is fantastic on the PG1 thanks to a large forefoot outrigger and flat outsole.
14347,334,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,A little snug and a little tight but the fit felt really nice.
14348,334,755,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The PG 1 provides a close one-to-one fit that stays with your foot during every cut, drive, jab and stop."
14349,334,486,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The overall fit was the best feature of this shoe. After a break in period the feel crazy good!
14350,334,6,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The one-bootie construction was a nice fit for my feet.
14351,334,649,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,I ultimately found the fit to be great. But the method in which its achieved isn’t ideal from an ease-of-use or comfort standpoint.
14352,334,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Lockdown is incredible. The midfoot feels perfectly secure and there are only four lace loops.
14353,334,86,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Even 1/2 size up, the PG1 required some break-in time due to the snugness."
14354,334,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Fit is pretty good.
14355,334,522,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"To me, the fit is the highlight of the shoe."
14356,334,293,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,The rubber is really soft so outdoor use is not recommended
14357,334,522,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,Forefoot upper might get beat up outdoors since it is mesh.
14358,334,486,2,2017-01-01,width,Wide footers: you need to try them on first!
14359,334,6,2,2017-12-27,width,The PG1 runs fairly narrow.
14360,334,293,2,2017-01-01,width,"Pretty snug, you could go half a size up if you have wide feet."
14361,334,701,2,2017-01-01,width,The fit is really narrow.
14362,334,522,2,2017-01-01,width,The thick sockliner probably contributes to the tighter than normal fit of the PG1.
14363,334,6,3,2017-12-27,size,Runs true to size.
14364,334,293,3,2017-01-01,size,Runs true to size.
14365,334,522,2,2017-01-01,size,I opted for half size up and all was better though
14366,335,32,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"When it comes to performance the KD9 Elite is very similar to the original KD9. The most notable difference is the strong lacing cables which slightly enhance support and lockdown. However, this new lacing setup also makes the shoe even narrower which led to some pain on the side of my feet."
14367,335,486,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,A great shoe with slight improvements over the original KD9. The upper material is softer and more comfortable and the new lacing system provides more lockdown and support.
14368,335,293,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,It's a very specific shoe. Great if you have narrow feet and you are looking for a shoe with a lot of cushion and impact protection. If you are a shifty guard who does a lot of crossovers and cuts then the lacking support of the upper and the slightly unstable platform are not ideal. Not recommended if you have wide feet.
14369,335,755,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The traction, cushion, and materials all bring out the best of Nike’s technology, unfortunately, the KD 9 Elite doesn't perform as well when it comes to support and fit."
14370,335,766,10.0,2025-04-18,user_overall,
14371,335,462,9.6,2022-05-31,user_overall,
14372,335,32,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction is really solid.
14373,335,486,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The honeycomb pattern is the same as in the KD9 and works very well.
14374,335,293,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"On clean courts, it's really nice, but on dusty courts, you are screwed."
14375,335,755,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The overall traction experience is pretty consistent and has you covered in all directions.
14376,335,32,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,A springy light cushioning setup. A lot of impact protection but I would have preferred more court feel.
14377,335,486,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Full length-zoom remains unchanged.
14378,335,293,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The full-length Nike Zoom cushioning is close to an ideal cushion.
14379,335,755,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Unchanged from the Original KD 9, and we're perfectly okay with that."
14380,335,32,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"The materials are lightweight, flexible and wrap around your feet really nicely."
14381,335,486,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The Flyknit is less tightly knit and allows for more ventilation.
14382,335,293,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The Flyknit is soft and looks a little better than in the original.
14383,335,755,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The Flyknit Upper is very comfortable.
14384,335,32,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"I really, really, really like this new setup of the KD9 elite. It really locks in your feet and I felt it offered a little more support than the regular KD9."
14385,335,486,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Adding a sleeve in the ankle area helps to improve lockdown and support which makes you feel a little more secure.
14386,335,293,7.0,2017-01-01,support,I wish there was a little more support.
14387,335,755,5.0,2017-01-01,support,My foot was sliding in every direction within the shoe with minimal effort and I just didn’t feel secure.
14388,335,486,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,The fit is more customizable but this shoe is still not made for wide-footers.
14389,335,755,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,"If you don’t have a long, narrow foot like Durant himself, you’re going to have some issues with the fit."
14390,335,293,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,The durability playing outdoors is probably not great since the rubber outsole is soft.
14391,335,486,5,2017-01-01,width,Not suitable for wide-footers.
14392,335,293,1,2017-01-01,width,The shoe is super narrow.
14393,336,615,8.8,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"At a retail price of $120, the Jordan Ultra Fly offers great bang for the buck."
14394,336,33,8.6,2017-12-27,expert_overall,This is the first Jordan Brand performance model I’ve bought in a long time that doesn’t make me feel like I was ripped off.
14395,336,486,8.5,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"For $125 this is a great performer. I don't feel like the Ultra Fly series gets enough respect. Heel and forefoot Zoom, mesh upper, nice traction - I can't ask for much more."
14396,336,615,8.0,2017-12-27,traction,"The traction was a little better than good, but attracts a lot of dust."
14397,336,33,7.0,2017-12-27,traction,Traction is inconsistent - works well on clean courts but collects a lot of dust.
14398,336,486,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,The traction is A1.
14399,336,615,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,The cushion is my favorite part of this shoe as it is super comfortable.
14400,336,33,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,The Ultra.Fly 2 uses heel and forefoot Zoom Air which is great at $125.
14401,336,486,8.0,2017-12-27,cushion,I like the cushioning on these.
14402,336,33,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,The upper of the Ultra.Fly 2 is an engineered knit that feels amazing on-foot.
14403,336,486,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,Generic synthetics and fuse provide great support and get the job done.
14404,336,615,9.0,2017-12-27,support,The one-bootie upper provides great lockdown - your feet are going nowhere!
14405,336,33,9.0,2017-12-27,support,Lateral outrigger? Check. Dynamic lacing system? Check. Internal heel counter? Check.
14406,336,615,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,This shoe is really hard to get on but very comfortable.
14407,336,33,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,Abundant padding makes this shoe very comfortable.
14408,336,486,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The one-piece-bootie upper feels great once you manage to put the shoes on.
14409,336,486,2,2017-12-27,width,The fit is kind of snug.
14410,336,486,3,2017-12-27,size,I would say this shoe runs true to size.
14411,337,176,8.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Charged Controller is quick, low-riding, well-cushioned but not super soft, with a locked-in fit just stable enough to make me feel bulletproof."
14412,337,86,8.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Under Armour Charged Controller is a fantastic shoe. It rides low, is responsive, locks you in and keeps you stable to do battle on the hardwood."
14413,337,755,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"When you take price out of the equation and put the Charged Controller up against some of the top-tier performers on the market today, it doesn’t quite belong in that group. But right below it? Absolutely. Oh, and did we mentioned that the shoe is only $100?"
14414,337,32,7.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, a solid shoe. Nothing super spectacular, but also no deal breakers. I wasn't happy with the traction and the cushioning wore out pretty quickly."
14415,337,293,6.1,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Even at a $100 bucks, we don't recommend this shoe. There are many other shoes out there that provide far better value."
14416,337,176,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,Dusty courts eat these alive.
14417,337,86,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction on these bad boys was hit or miss, good on clean courts but on dusty courts, you need to wipe a lot."
14418,337,755,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The Charged Controller’s outsole is going to find dust, and when it does, wiping is going to become an absolute necessity."
14419,337,32,6.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction is very inconsistent. Even on mildly dusty courts, it's a slip and slide fest."
14420,337,293,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,Dust sticks like crazy and you have to wipe a lot.
14421,337,176,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Impact protection stands up to anything thrown at it - I felt no pain in the knees.
14422,337,86,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushioning was on the firmer side to compliment the low ride for great court feel.
14423,337,755,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The full-length Micro G midsole carriage provides the perfect balance between plush comfort and firm responsiveness.
14424,337,32,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Good impact protection and very responsive feel.
14425,337,293,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Impact protection is okay, but it's not bouncy at all."
14426,337,176,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Honestly, this is one of the most comfortable basketball shoes this season."
14427,337,86,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"This is where the shoe shines. An all woven upper, some fuse on high-wear areas, and an external heel counter — plus solid rubber traction for $100."
14428,337,755,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"For only $100, the materials are a pretty good bargain that any hooper should be happy with"
14429,337,32,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Super lightweight, very breathable and soft Threadborne upper."
14430,337,293,6.5,2017-01-01,materials,"The materials are heavily glued and very stiff, especially in the front."
14431,337,176,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"If you need some serious upright stability help, look elsewhere. If you enjoy shoes that feel like they aren’t there, sit down and take a look."
14432,337,86,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"The materials, external heel counter, lacing setup, and herringbone traction offer everything that you need, and nothing you don’t."
14433,337,755,7.0,2017-01-01,support,The Charged Controller has just enough support features to be reliable but not enough to be amazing.
14434,337,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Support and Lockdown was a strong point on these.
14435,337,293,5.0,2017-01-01,support,"Strong materials and outrigger provide decent support, the lockdown wasn't very good because the fit just wasn't there."
14436,337,176,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The lacing system allows for some serious adjustments so even wide footers should be happy.
14437,337,86,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"A minor break-in period with the woven, but after a couple of games, the materials contour to your feet nicely."
14438,337,755,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,The fit toward the front of the Charged Controller is a bit roomy.
14439,337,293,5.0,2017-01-01,fit,There was too much room in the toebox. This shoe is for a fat-footer.
14440,337,293,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,Solid rubber should be okay outdoors.
14441,337,293,4,2017-01-01,width,If you have wide feet you might like these.
14442,337,293,3,2017-01-01,size,Go true to size.
14443,338,293,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I didn't like the Melo M13. As a guard, don't get these! The cushioning and the materials are good, but the traction was a dealbreaker for me."
14444,338,176,7.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Nice try, but not quite. Felled by traction and support, the Melo M13 had potential."
14445,338,767,9.2,2023-07-08,user_overall,The best shoes
14446,338,293,5.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction sucks! I was sliding all over the place.
14447,338,176,5.0,2017-01-01,traction,"How do I say this? Oh, I know: not good."
14448,338,293,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The cushioning in the forefoot is bouncy and responsive, impact protection is decent."
14449,338,176,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Well cushioned, responsive and a lot of impact protection."
14450,338,293,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Soft mesh material is comfortable and good-looking.
14451,338,176,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,Mesh feels great and comfortable but Kurim overlay seems useless.
14452,338,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Materials are very supportive, but there were problems with heel slippage."
14453,338,176,5.0,2017-01-01,support,"No heel counter, no forefoot containment, which means my foot was all over the place inside the shoe while cutting and stopping."
14454,338,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,A tad wide but otherwise the fit was nice.
14455,338,176,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Once laced solid, there is no heel slip or midfoot movement to really complain about."
14456,338,293,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,The rubber is pretty hard so you should be okay outdoors.
14457,339,32,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"An improvement over the last year, but I didn't like the clunkiness of the transition and the $175 price tag is pretty steep."
14458,339,649,8.3,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Ultimately, the things I like about the 14 overshadow those that I don’t. Because of that, I thoroughly enjoyed playing in it."
14459,339,33,8.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The LeBron 14 isn’t perfect, but no shoe is. Impact protection and overall mobility are great, traction wasn't bad either."
14460,339,701,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I value impact protection heavily, therefore, they are one of the best sneakers available right now."
14461,339,176,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The overall court feel, transition, cushioning, and clean-floor traction make the LeBron 14 feel fast and smooth to play in."
14462,339,522,7.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I consider the Lebron XIV one of the most comfortable but under performing Lebrons I’ve ever worn. Great cushioning and soft materials can only cover flaws to a certain extent.
14463,339,293,7.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"As a guard, I did not enjoy the shoe. But for big guys this should be a great shoe."

14466,339,32,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction is pretty standard.
14467,339,649,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,Clean court? All good. Dusty court? You’ll need to swipe.
14468,339,33,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"It gets the job done for sure, it just could have been better."
14469,339,701,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"It's good, not great."
14470,339,176,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Depending on the floor, great. Or not great. Good, maybe?"
14471,339,522,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction on clean floors works well. However, on a dusty court you need to wipe constantly."
14472,339,293,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"On a clean court it was good, but it picks up a good amount of dust quickly."
14473,339,32,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The cushioning is pretty good, but to be honest I am not a big fan of the Hex Zoom setup."
14474,339,649,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Pod-based Zoom is back and feels better than ever.
14475,339,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Hex Zoom Air returns, and it is freaking awesome."
14476,339,701,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushioning is absolutely beastly and the impact protection is top of the line.
14477,339,176,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Zoom, broken into the smaller units,  is bouncy, responsive, and cushions every landing and step perfectly."
14478,339,522,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Cushioning is the highlight of the XIV.
14479,339,293,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,It wasn't amazing but felt okay
14480,339,32,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,Materials are an upgrade over the previous year.
14481,339,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,I like the materials. I just don’t like having to pay $175 for this type of material.
14482,339,701,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Overall, materials are good."
14483,339,176,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Overall, the materials get the job done in a nice package, but they just don’t feel like $175 materials."
14484,339,522,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,I’m not a materials snob so the materials work fine and feel soft but for $175 I expect better.
14485,339,293,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Materials do the job, but they could have been a little more premium."
14486,339,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Ankle strap provides additional layer of support.
14487,339,649,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"Thanks to the shoe’s heel padding and the aforementioned strap, my feet were locked tight,"
14488,339,33,7.0,2017-01-01,support,This is one area that definitely could have been better overall.
14489,339,701,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Support is good but still gives you a lot of flexibility.
14490,339,176,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Overall, this is probably the least supportive LeBron signature ever."
14491,339,522,7.0,2017-01-01,support,Support isn’t great either.
14492,339,293,7.0,2017-01-01,support,It's a pretty supportive shoe
14493,339,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,A little bit of heel slippage for narrower feet.
14494,339,649,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,"I was able to get a secure fit if I pulled the laces tight enough, and I found the strap to be very functional in adding a layer of security. But it all came at the price of comfort."
14495,339,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The LeBron 14 utilizes a one-piece bootie construction comprised of soft/flimsy materials.
14496,339,701,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,Lockdown is the weakest part of the shoe and the laces come undone easily
14497,339,176,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,Very questionable.
14498,339,522,6.0,2017-01-01,fit,"It didn’t work for me at all. Movement on cuts inside the shoe, heel slip, you name it I had it."
14499,339,293,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,Lockdown wasn't great and there was a little bit of heel slippage.
14500,339,701,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,Traction was adequate outdoors.
14501,339,293,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,"We didn't test it, but outdoor use should be okay because the rubber is pretty hard."
14502,339,701,4,2017-01-01,width,They are a bit roomy.
14503,339,522,4,2017-01-01,width,The width is generous on the XIV
14504,339,293,5,2017-01-01,width,If you have a narrow foot you are going to swim in it
14505,339,701,3,2017-01-01,size,I'd say they fit true to size.
14506,339,522,3,2017-01-01,size,These run very true to size.
14507,339,293,3,2017-01-01,size,Go true to size
14508,340,293,8.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"As a guard, I don't like playing in these very much. Slightly bulky, and higher off the ground than I prefer. It's definitely a decent shoe, but it just wasn't for me."
14509,340,755,8.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"If you’re looking for a cloud-like ride, with great materials and a glove-like fit, the Zoom Rev ’17 is going to get the job done really well."
14510,340,176,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Zoom Rev 17 is an extremely solid option for someone looking for quickness, forefoot cushioning while still riding low, and a great fit."
14511,340,293,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction is okay, but I would have liked a little more bite."
14512,340,755,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"On clean floors, the traction is great of course, but if your floor has any dust whatsoever, you’re going to find yourself wiping quite a bit."
14513,340,176,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Tricky, tricky traction. Very good on lateral moves, inconsistent on straight-line starts and stops."
14514,340,293,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Impact protection is nice, responsiveness is good, but I would like a lower ride."
14515,340,755,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Responsive Nike Zoom Air in the forefoot and surprisingly soft Phylon in the heel.
14516,340,176,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The Zoom Unit in the forefoot is very responsive, Phylon in the heel works very well too."
14517,340,293,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Materials are really soft and premium - no break-in period needed.
14518,340,755,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,This is easily the Zoom Rev’s best category. The soft mesh upper is very comfortable.
14519,340,176,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,The soft mesh with thick foam backing is flexible and comfortable from the start.
14520,340,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Firm material and great lockdown but ankle protection could need improvement.
14521,340,755,7.0,2017-01-01,support,Fit and internal heel cup provide a moderate support system.
14522,340,176,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"Supportive midsole, heel counter and the excellent fit provide solid support."
14523,340,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Fit is really nice, no dead space at all."
14524,340,755,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"For someone who’s foot is slightly wide, these fit me like a glove"
14525,340,176,10.0,2017-01-01,fit,The fit is dead-on. The forefoot was wrapped like a second skin.
14526,340,293,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,"Soft rubber, I wouldn't recommend outdoor use."
14527,341,293,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"A really nice shoe, I enjoyed playing in it a lot. This should have been the Kyrie 3. Guards - you will love it!"
14528,341,33,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Taking the $100 price tag out of the equation, the Nike Zoom Live 2017 stands up against Nike’s higher priced models and outshines them. If you’re a fan of low tops then you’ll likely be a fan of these."
14529,341,413,8.0,2023-02-04,user_overall,"The shoe itself  is pretty abnormal in my opinion. The traction is really weird but it works pretty nicely but there might be dust problems often. Cushion ain't too bad. The support feels alright. The materials feels pretty cheap as the shoe itself isn't expensive. For outdoor use, it's alright. The traction rubber isn't too hard or too soft so the shoe would be alright to play with outside. This shoes are good for wide feet too."
14530,341,293,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Even on dusty courts, the traction is decent. On a clean court, it's really, really good."
14531,341,33,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction straight up kills it on most courts and conditions without issue.
14532,341,293,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,I love the feeling of the top-loaded Zoom unit in the forefoot.
14533,341,33,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"When surrounded with the right kind of Phylon, Zoom Air thrives — and that’s exactly what we have here."
14534,341,293,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The material is really soft and feels like a woven textile upper. No break-in time required.
14535,341,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Mesh, nylon, and a bit of fuse in high-wear areas. Simple, comfortable, and straight to the point."
14536,341,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Materials are sturdy and provide good protection.
14537,341,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Basic at its core, yet very effective."
14538,341,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,There is no dead space and the fit is really good.
14539,341,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Containment is solid and heel lockdown is fantastic thanks to the strap.
14540,341,293,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,"Rubber is hard and pretty thick, so might work outdoors."
14541,342,522,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"This is my first pass at the Mentality, I mean Instinct line and I am pleasantly surprised. I had a hard time differentiating performance wise between the Kobe 8; both sit low to the ground with excellent traction and fit."
14542,342,293,8.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,At $100 you can't go wrong! A very minimal and responsive shoe for guards who don't need a lot of impact protection.
14543,342,739,8.3,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I really enjoyed playing in the Nike Mamba Mentality. You get to enjoy a Flyweave upper and a full-length Lunarlon midsole which is perfect for all-around players.
14544,342,169,9.0,2023-11-28,user_overall,One of my favorite shoes to hoop in outdoors however the traction didn’t hold up for too long. Wouldn’t recommend this for outdoor use just because of how bad the durability is on this shoe however performance wise its amazing outdoors. Wish I used these indoors just to have the shoe last longer. I did get these for about $65 at footlocker in 2016 though so it wasn’t super expensive and I loved how the drop in midsole conformed to my foot after playing in them.￼
14545,342,503,8.6,2022-06-14,user_overall,Traction was pretty good. Cushion was low and very responsive

14549,342,522,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,I found this traction pattern to work great on clean floors and on dusty floors.
14550,342,293,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"On a clean court, it's great, but you will have to wipe a lot on dusty courts."
14551,342,739,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"While it grips the floor well, the traction isn't as consistent or durable as in the Kobe Mentality 2."
14552,342,522,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Even with the firmer setup, cushioning is directly underfoot so it feels good overall."
14553,342,293,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Lunarlon cushioning is pretty firm but you feel very low to the ground.
14554,342,739,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Lunarlon is light but gives a perfect balance between court feel and impact protection.
14555,342,522,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Overall the materials are great and give a budget shoe a premium feel.
14556,342,293,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Flyweave is thin, strong and feels really soft."
14557,342,739,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"There is a small break-in period but after that, the flyweave materials feel natural."
14558,342,522,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Overall support and stability is good but midfoot support just isn’t there.
14559,342,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The support comes from the great fit and lockdown.
14560,342,522,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,No dead space side to side and very little above the foot. Zero heel slip as usual from the get-go.
14561,342,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,No dead space anywhere.
14562,342,739,7.5,2017-01-01,fit,Make sure these fit you perfect because support is very basic and depends on a great fit.
14563,342,522,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,The rubber is very soft and pliable so I don’t recommend these for outdoors.
14564,342,293,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,The rubber is too soft and shallow for outdoor use.
14565,342,293,3,2017-01-01,size,Go true to size.
14566,343,6,8.4,2017-12-27,expert_overall,If you are a quick guard and you don't need a lot of impact protection then the Kyrie 3 is a great choice.
14567,343,486,8.3,2017-01-01,expert_overall,Probably my favorite shoe to hoop in right now!
14568,343,293,8.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I really love to play in them, but I can't play a lot because of the lack of cushioning. Incredibly responsive shoe with excellent traction."
14569,343,33,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed playing in the Kyrie 3,  If cushion is your main need then you should already know what that means for you and the Kyrie 3. But if court feel and traction are your only concerns then these might be your new best friend."
14570,343,32,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Decent, affordable shoe, especially if you are a small guard. Personally I didn't really like these shoes but at $120 they are definitely a decent performer."
14571,343,649,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Kyrie 3 is a solid shoe, but I can’t help but feel a bit disappointed. And this admittedly comes from the high expectations I had after liking the first two shoes so much. But from the design, to the cushioning, to the comfort, it’s just not what I’d hoped for."
14572,343,701,7.7,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, I like the Kyrie 3 but I am not crazy about it. Not in my top-3 rotation, but a good sneaker with a fair price. Especially quick guards will like the traction and court feel."
14573,343,86,7.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I did thoroughly enjoy the shoe, particularly the materials and the traction. It's such a minimalistic shoe that Nike almost had everything working in unison -- almost. More cushion is definitely a much-needed necessity and a well thought out execution with support would suffice. This is a shoe for players that cut heavily, need minimalistic cushion, and rely on that court-feel."
14574,343,522,7.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,Not the best value out there but a good performer overall...The Kyrie 3 just feels like a quick high cut tennis shoe for players that value lateral quickness over everything else.
14575,343,560,9.2,2023-12-22,user_overall,"The Kyrie 3 was one of my first basketball shoes. While they didn’t fit my playstyle at the start, I definitely “grew” into them (as everyone grew taller around me) and they offered a quick way for me to adapt to the guard position. The sole was stiff, but were shaped to tension the muscles in your shin for maximum explosiveness. They were raw and offered absolutely no cushion. I have quite wide feet, but I was able to make it work and only experienced discomfort near the end of regulation."
14576,343,768,8.9,2023-04-06,user_overall,"I’ve used the Kyrie 3s for years as an outdoor hooper. After a while it got less and less comfortable but that would make sense. The traction and sole are great. Super durable and after 6 years of wearing them I’m just now about to purchase a new hoop shoe. Still keeping these as a rotational practice shoe. I think if you want a good solid shoe that is secure and durable this is the one, just not the most comfortable."
14577,343,769,6.4,2021-12-07,user_overall,Don't get everyone's rave on the traction. I had to wipe a lot on a not so dusty court. I've lost my footing so many times moving forward and sliding at a stop. My busted knees are headed out to the store fo
14578,343,556,8.8,2021-11-26,user_overall,"My very first Kyrie shoe! Loved playing with it. It has amazing traction and a great lockdown feel. The only downside I had with the shoe was the cushion,  my feet would get fatigued towards the end of my games and the next day would see minor blisters on my foot. It's great for quick pick-up games and works well outside."
14579,343,361,8.4,2022-01-23,user_overall,"I loved these so much, I had to cop the Bruce Lee pair too! The traction works wonders and stops on a DIME! The cushion is pretty lack luster, but very responsive which is good for guards like me. The materials weren’t bad, felt cheep in hand but got the job done on foot. Overall, I loved this shoe a lot!"
14580,343,6,9.5,2017-12-27,traction,This traction is beastly!
14581,343,486,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,Traction was by far my favorite part of this shoe. Aggressive Herringbone pattern allowed me to move in any direction
14582,343,293,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Incredible, even on a dusty court the traction is amazing."
14583,343,33,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,Near perfection is the simplest way to describe the setup [of traction pattern]
14584,343,32,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction did a pretty good job, however I did have a few slips here and there on a dusty court."
14585,343,649,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The cupped sole of the Kyrie 3 not only has sticky traction ... it has lots of it.
14586,343,701,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The court feel is absolutely excellent. The traction on these is very, very good, even on outdoor courts."
14587,343,86,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The shoe utilizes an aggressive herringbone ... allowing a guard like [Kyrie] to aggressively change directions without losing any time
14588,343,522,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,Overall traction is very good overall but I feel the Kyrie 2 provided better consistent traction overall
14589,343,6,7.0,2017-12-27,cushion,The Kyrie 3 feels like rocks on your feet.
14590,343,486,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Apart from the little zoom unit in the heel you get nothing. But this setup didn't bother me
14591,343,293,6.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"I can't feel the zoom unit, the cushion is rock hard and impact protection sucks."
14592,343,33,5.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The Kyrie 3 has no cushion aside from the heel Zoom Air unit.
14593,343,32,6.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Very minimal cushioning but very responsive.
14594,343,649,5.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"I could feel the lack of impact protection in my feet, knees and back after every run."
14595,343,701,6.0,2017-01-01,cushion,It's not an overly cushioned shoe but comfort is decent. Impact-protection practically non-existent.
14596,343,86,5.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Um…what cushion?
14597,343,522,6.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Cushioning is very firm on the Kyrie 3
14598,343,6,7.5,2017-12-27,materials,Materials are a huge improvement over the Kyrie 2.
14599,343,486,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,Nice materials to contain your movements.
14600,343,293,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Kind of cheap-looking mesh. Very supportive, no stretch."
14601,343,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,... and I really love the materials
14602,343,32,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,Materials are good but nothing special.  Very unbreathable.
14603,343,86,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,The shoe is minimalistic yet effective in the usage of materials and it worked very well.
14604,343,522,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,I think the materials are fine and don’t affect playability
14605,343,6,9.0,2017-12-27,support,The support is crazy good!
14606,343,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Ankle support isn't the best. Lockdown is very good, there is no slipping."
14607,343,33,7.0,2017-01-01,support,The support features are basic throughout
14608,343,32,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Support and lockdown is hugging my feet perfectly.
14609,343,649,7.0,2017-01-01,support,... my ankles felt safe and secure... the collar was a bit uncomfortable
14610,343,701,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"The lockdown is good, but not great.Foot Support is amazing, ankle support is only okay."
14611,343,86,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"There is an internal shank plate for torsional support, an internal heel counter to keep your foot locked in place"
14612,343,522,7.0,2017-01-01,support,Overall just a solid supportive and stable shoe.
14613,343,6,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,"No heel slippage, no side-to-side movement."
14614,343,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Great fit for narrow feet , no toe room at all."
14615,343,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,I felt locked in the entire time without a single issue
14616,343,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,First impression was very comfortable and a lot less narrow then the previous Kyrie models.
14617,343,649,10.0,2017-01-01,fit,"If basketball sneakers were judged solely on fit, this would be among the absolute top tier of sneakers I’ve ever played in"
14618,343,86,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The lockdown felt great from heel to forefoot and there was no deadspace at all.
14619,343,522,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"After a few hours of break in time, you almost forget they are on your feet as the upper softens up."
14620,343,293,100.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,The rubber is actually really hard so you can play these outdoors.
14621,343,522,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,The outsole and the upper is made of durable material which should work well outdoors.
14622,343,293,2,2017-01-01,width,A little narrow
14623,343,701,2,2017-01-01,width,Runs a little bit narrow through the middle of the foot. If you have super wide feet these will probably not for you.
14624,343,522,2,2017-01-01,width,very wide footers will probably want to go up half a size
14625,343,701,3,2017-01-01,size,Definitely true to size
14626,343,522,3,2017-01-01,size,"I bought my true to size 11 and initially thought I should have gone up half a size. However, after playing in them a few weeks, true to size was the way to go."
14627,344,33,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The adidas Harden Vol. 1 is a very well balanced shoe for guards. Traction, cushion, materials, fit, support…the best of what adidas has to offer all on one sneaker? Reasonably priced? And they’ve been doing this all year long? You best believe it."
14628,344,176,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"If you are a guard, or forward, or big man who doesn’t mind lows, you will enjoy this shoe. Fit, cushion, traction, and support are all nice for anyone unless you just feel like you need a super-light shoe (you don’t)."
14629,344,293,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The fit is good, the traction is amazing. The shoe feels light, and the cushion is very responsive. The Harden Vol. 1 is a very good shoe and does live up to the reputation James Harden has as a talented and explosive player."
14630,344,6,8.9,2017-12-27,expert_overall,These are my favourite shoes as of right now!
14631,344,32,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I like the cushioning, traction and materials, but I had sharp pain in the toe area and the lacing system is trash. Overall the Harden 1 is a pretty solid performance sneaker."
14632,344,522,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Harden Vol 1 is one of those shoes I like a lot. Its tech is great, it looks good, it’s made well and it isn’t too expensive. However, Adidas ruined an excellent traction set up with the Fibonacci design and as a traction lover, this did the shoe in for me. Well that and my arch pain."
14633,344,486,7.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, the shoe gets the job done. There's nothing special here, the shoe is a decent performer, but the traction threw me for a slip."
14634,344,701,7.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The fit was a little bit off, but I'd probably give those a 7/10. It's a great option for guards who are looking for traction and court feel."
14635,344,71,7.4,2022-03-19,user_overall,Tried playing with these a few times but eventually gave up as they just didn’t feel right.
14636,344,770,7.8,2021-11-12,user_overall,Great performance! Loved the traction on these. Really bites hard.
14637,344,747,7.6,2021-12-28,user_overall,
14638,344,33,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Not once did I have to wipe the soles of these guys, even when the courts were dusty."
14639,344,176,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Yeah, the Harden Vol 1 is good. Almost great."
14640,344,293,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction is, in a word, amazing! The stopping power is incredible and only attracts minimal dust which is fixed with a light wipe."
14641,344,6,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,This is probably one of the best traction patterns on the market right now!
14642,344,32,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction on these shoes is awesome.
14643,344,522,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"It works well on clean courts or when freshly wiped (what doesn’t) but once dirt gets on the sole, the shoe gets slippery and you do have to wipe frequently."
14644,344,486,6.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Not impressive, the traction would have performed better if the had kept it simple."
14645,344,701,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction on these was absolutely beastmode on all surfaces.
14646,344,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,You’ll receive all the court feel you can possibly want while still receiving protection underfoot. It’s just not a plush ride.
14647,344,176,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Boost with court feel? Yes, please. The Harden Vol 1 has the lowest ride of any full-length Boost shoe and you can tell, but not in a bad way, it still absorbs and responds like Boost should."
14648,344,293,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The boost midsole is not very thick, but it does provide a lot of impact protection and feels very responsive with no bounce."
14649,344,6,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,"Minimal Boost cushioning is low-to-the-ground, responsive but still offers decent impact protection."
14650,344,32,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Probably my favorite part of the shoe. It' not as plush as on the Crazy Explosives but more plush than the Crazy Light Boost 2016 - I really like it a lot.
14651,344,522,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"If you’re expecting Ultra Boost plushness look elsewhere but if you want a ride that has a some bounce to it and rides pretty low, you’ll like this set up."
14652,344,486,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,This is the best part of the shoe. Low to the ground full length boost provides a good balance between court feel and comfortable cushioning.
14653,344,701,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Me, personally, I would like the boost cushioning to be a bit thicker. Impact protection is pretty good, but definitely not great"
14654,344,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,I enjoyed the setup quite a bit
14655,344,176,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"The materials you get depend on the colorway you purchase.  Soft and already broken in, the materials should be durable enough for a season of play."
14656,344,293,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"The materials feel nice and plush. The Primeknit is soft, breaks in easily, and seems like it is a supportive material."
14657,344,6,8.5,2017-12-27,materials,The knit upper feels really comfortable on feet.
14658,344,32,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Materials are pretty standard, but it's still pretty good especially after breaking it in. The lining felt amazing."
14659,344,522,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Overall the materials are great.
14660,344,486,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Significant break-in period., but after that the material feels good"
14661,344,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Your natural balance isn’t thrown off when you lace these up and they’ve widened the platform a bit which only enhances stability.
14662,344,176,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"HIgh arch support, wide and flat base, and caged boost deliver solid support."
14663,344,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,This shoe is pretty supportive for a low top
14664,344,32,7.0,2017-01-01,support,It was hard to tie the shoe laces really tight and therefore there was a little bit of slippage.
14665,344,522,10.0,2017-01-01,support,"This is the best part of the Harden Vol 1 in my opinion. Stability is excellent, not once did I ever feel like I was going to roll my ankle in these because I felt stable and connected to the ground."
14666,344,486,7.0,2017-01-01,support,Support is much better than the Crazy light. One of the more supportive low-tops.
14667,344,701,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"The support is good, thanks to the heel counter, boost caging, and outrigger."
14668,344,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Luckily, this is one of the best fitting low top shoes."
14669,344,176,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,When playing there is no movement in the forefoot even with the extra space — just lace tight.
14670,344,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The midfoot area feels pretty narrow and widens out in the toe box, which feels pretty nice."
14671,344,6,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The fit is phenomenal - no heel slippage or side-to-side movement at all.
14672,344,32,6.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The pain was ridiculous in the beginning because the toe cap was digging into my foot. After the break-in period, it became a lot better."
14673,344,522,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,Some may say the Harden V1 is ultra comfortable out of the box but I found it to take a week or so to break in and soften up.
14674,344,701,6.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Fit my foot a little bit awkwardly. Where the leather of the toe cap meets the mesh, the shoes pinched my toes."
14675,344,293,4,2017-01-01,size,"The Harden Vol. 1 runs a little long, so go down 1/2 of a size"
14676,344,6,4,2017-12-27,size,These run a half size large.
14677,344,522,4,2017-01-01,size,I suggest half a size down for everyone except wide footers and up. Best to try on in store
14678,344,486,4,2017-01-01,size,I recommend go half a size down
14679,344,701,4,2017-01-01,size,About a half size long
14680,345,176,9.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The Dame 3 combines great cushioning, good traction, killer materials, and a price that can’t be beat — into a package that, honestly, looks great too."
14681,345,33,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The adidas Dame 3 is a great sneaker. It’s very well rounded in every category and it will accommodate most players and foot shapes. From the traction, to the plush and bouncy cushion, to the materials that balance durability without the need for break-in time — the adidas Dame 3 has it all."
14682,345,293,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, it's a really, really nice shoe. The cushion is nice, the traction is good but not the best on dusty courts and the materials are good. The only two things I didn't like are that the shoe feels slightly bulky especially in the heel and the lockdown is not very good."
14683,345,32,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, this is a pretty solid hoops shoe, especially for the sticker price it goes for. You got great traction and cushioning, good support and lockdown and solid materials. Unfortunately the fit isn't very comfortable."
14684,345,522,8.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The improved traction really got me excited and I liked the faster feel of the Dame 3 cushioning. However, the lack of padding at the midfoot and especially around the ankle really made the lace pressure uncomfortable.  I feel like the Dame 3 is one of those shoes that performs well in every catagory but just under performs as a shoe overall."
14685,345,486,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, I would probably still go with the D Lillard 2 over the Dame 3. But the Dame 3 isn't bad at all and gets the job done. Most people will enjoy this shoe, especially once you found a lacing pattern that is comfortable for you."

14689,345,176,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,The Dame 3 may have the best traction out right now.
14690,345,33,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Blade traction setup works beautifully.
14691,345,293,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"On a clean court you stop really, really hard. However, the shoes pick up a good amount of dust."
14692,345,32,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction of the Dame 3 is money.
14693,345,522,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Not quite top tier but close enough.
14694,345,486,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction is not mind-blowing but solid for sure.
14695,345,176,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Bounce was a revelation last year in the Lillard 2 !- low ride, bouncy (DUH!), and durable. More of the same in the Dame 3"
14696,345,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Bounce makes a return to Damian Lillard’s third signature model and I couldn’t be happier.
14697,345,293,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Cushioning is firmer than in previous models, impact protection is really good."
14698,345,32,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Great cushioning!
14699,345,522,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Overall I found it a firmer than last year but still comfortable enough.
14700,345,486,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"I personally enjoy the bounce setup. Great balance, enough cushioning without overcompensating."
14701,345,176,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Mesh/fuse-like material seems like a step back, but it works."
14702,345,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Fuse mesh makes its way onto the adidas Dame 3 and it’s a pretty cool material choice.
14703,345,293,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,I really like the materials.
14704,345,32,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,I don't really like the fuse / mesh combo but the materials are pretty solid.
14705,345,522,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,It doesn’t feel premium since it’s fused mesh but it works which is perfectly fine for me.
14706,345,486,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,"I wasn't impressed with the materials. The shoe has a plastic feel to it, and needs time to break in"
14707,345,176,9.0,2017-01-01,support,I landed on two different feet while playing in these and did not roll an ankle either time.
14708,345,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The support of the Dame 3 is greatly improved when directly compared to the D Lillard 2.
14709,345,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Outrigger for stability and thick mid sole provide good support.
14710,345,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Much more lateral support compared to last year's model
14711,345,522,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Overall support and stability is excellent on the Dame 3 even if the midfoot support is a little overdone.
14712,345,486,8.0,2017-01-01,support,I didn't like the exaggerated TPU midfoot shank until I found a lacing pattern that fit better.
14713,345,176,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Multiple lacing holes mean everyone should be able to find a lacing style to fit their foot. Minimal heel slip.
14714,345,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The shoe held my foot in place so well I almost gave it a WearTesters Hall of Fame badge.
14715,345,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"A good amount of heel slippage, otherwise fit was really good."
14716,345,32,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,Uncomfortable around the ankle and a little bit of heel slippage
14717,345,522,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,Very tiny heel slip which is fine.  Lace pressure is painful because there isn’t much padding in the tongue or around the ankle collar.
14718,345,486,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,I like the fit on the Dame 3.
14719,345,293,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,"The rubber is so soft, I wouldn't recommend outdoor use."
14720,345,486,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,When I did take them outside the performance was fair
14721,345,293,5,2017-01-01,size,"Definitely go down half a size, maybe even a full size."
14722,345,522,4,2017-01-01,size,I recommend half a size down. Wide footers can go true to size.
14723,345,486,4,2017-01-01,size,Go half a size down.
14724,346,32,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I love everything about the Kobe AD except the painful break-in period. The overall aesthetics are great, the cushion is on point, the lockdown is there. The shoe is lightweight but still supportive and sturdy."
14725,346,293,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Very good looking shoes for guards. I enjoy it, I really like the shoe. Unfortunately rather long break-in period."
14726,346,522,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I enjoyed playing in the Kobe AD a lot even though it wasn’t perfect. Great traction and excellent fit with firmer than normal Kobe line cushioning that needs break in but feels decent after. When you see the price of $160, you’ll expect more since other comparative shoes out there under that price point are offering nicer materials than the mesh on the Kobe AD."
14727,346,6,7.6,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"For $160 there are much better options out there. Great lockdown, but painful break-in period, cheap materials and lacking cushioning."
14728,346,33,7.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,Utter disappointment. Was I duped? $160 spent and wasted. Those are my feelings when thinking about the Nike Kobe A.D. If you enjoy your pair then I am genuinely happy for you as that would mean you enjoy your purchase and don’t share the same sentiment that I do. Every once in a while a brand puts out a dud. This was a giant one.
14729,346,755,6.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"To put it bluntly, the Kobe A.D. has no innovation, no ambition, and nothing worthy enough to be associated with the five-time world champion, 18-time All-Star, 15-time All-NBA, future Hall of Famer, Kobe Bryant. The visual appeal of Kobe’s first post-retirement sneaker is off the charts but this is a performance review, and in that regard, the Kobe A.D. is more than just a disappointment."
14730,346,71,9.8,2022-03-19,user_overall,Played great ball with these shoes for more than 2 years!

14733,346,32,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction of the Kobe AD is really, really good, especially on clean courts. Some wiping may be needed on dustier courts, but is still really solid."
14734,346,293,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Soft rubber offers good traction even on dusty courts. Not the best but pretty damn good!
14735,346,522,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,These are not quite top tier traction due to the flat parts of the outsole but they are great overall
14736,346,6,8.0,2017-12-27,traction,"The traction pattern on the front of the shoe works well on clean and dusty courts, but the traction on the heel has problems on dusty courts."
14737,346,33,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"...when it was good it was awesome. When it wasn’t…well, it wasn’t. If you want consistency within the traction then solid rubber should be a much better option [than translucent rubber]."
14738,346,755,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,The overall performance of the outsole was pretty solid but the rubber compound that is used here is an absolute dust magnet and will require frequent wiping on floors where the conditions are less than ideal.
14739,346,32,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Lunarlon in the front is very flexible, in the back Nike zoom provides ""GOAT cushioning"". This cushioning setup is just awesome."
14740,346,293,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Heel Zoom unit is caged and barely noticable. Lunarlon did a good job with impact protection.
14741,346,522,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"If you thought the cushioning of the Kobe X was too stiff, you’ll hate these.  Overall, the cushioning isn’t the greatest in terms of pure comfort but it is a good blend of impact protection and responsiveness."
14742,346,6,7.0,2017-12-27,cushion,Impact protection isn't really there and you can barely feel the Zoom unit.
14743,346,33,5.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The setup is very lackluster and required more break-in time than one expects to put up with nowadays. Pain at the arch of the foot, unresponsive Zoom, and Lunlarlon that has similar properties to Phylon. Not a good look."
14744,346,755,5.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"To sum things up; no impact protection, mediocre court feel, and a long break-in period. Yes, it’s as bad as it sounds."
14745,346,32,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,"The materials of the shoe are really stiff in the beginning, especially the huge tongue. After a significant break-in period it feels good. Not very breathable."
14746,346,293,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Very uncomfortable in the beginning,  needs a few days of breaking in."
14747,346,522,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,The mesh on the AD looks and feels cheap and starts off stiff but broke in within a few hours which is more than acceptable.
14748,346,6,7.0,2017-12-27,materials,"Really stiff mesh that takes an eternity to break in. Comfort is not bad, but breathability is a huge problem."
14749,346,33,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,"[Materials] are great for those that require more support and want to keep things as light as possible. However, the materials also require more break-in time than one would expect today. My pair still hasn’t broken-in and I’ve been trying to get them used to my foot for about a month now."
14750,346,755,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Materials: Straight out of the box, the ballistic mesh-like upper feels extremely stiff, but after a standard break-in period the materials end up being slightly above average."
14751,346,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Flywire and heel counter do a great job keeping you foot in place.
14752,346,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Lockdown and support was really good.
14753,346,522,7.0,2017-01-01,support,I didn’t worry about turning my ankle in these because overall they felt stable. Can’t say I enjoyed the rolling outrigger but it didn’t ruin my day or my game since it doesn’t occur constantly.
14754,346,6,9.0,2017-12-27,support,Support is excellent thanks to the huge heel counter. There is no heel slippage or side-to-side movement.
14755,346,33,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"There is a tiny outrigger in place, and it gets in the way (somehow) more often than not.  However, the heel containment and support is excellent."
14756,346,755,5.0,2017-01-01,support,"If you get a pair, support is just fine and will provide the necessary features that you need to feel secure on-court, but you are taking a huge risk counting on the durability of the Kobe A.D."
14757,346,32,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,Hurt badly in the beginning but after they break in they fit pretty well and feel good.
14758,346,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Fit was good, very little dead space in the toe box."
14759,346,522,10.0,2017-01-01,fit,Side to side movement was non existent and there is virtually no deadspace on top of the forefoot either. The AD fit makes the shoe feel like an extension of your foot especially after break in.
14760,346,6,7.0,2017-12-27,fit,I went up half a size but my feet are still hanging over the side of the shoe.
14761,346,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Containment and support from the fit are well balanced. The heel is the best aspect since the forefoot — even though it fits and contains — caused a ton of pain due to the materials used.
14762,346,755,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,When you first step into the Kobe A.D. you might feel like they’re too tight but after the materials break-in the overall fit is pretty fantastic.
14763,346,293,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,"The rubber is soft, therefore, outdoor use is not recommended."
14764,346,6,1,2017-12-27,width,These run narrow as hell.
14765,346,293,4,2017-01-01,size,"Felt almost a little long, but very narrow. If you have narrow feet go a half size down, otherwise go true to size."
14766,346,522,3,2017-01-01,size,Nike is very consistent with their fit and the Kobe AD is no different as it runs true to size.
14767,347,33,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Tacky traction, much-improved cushion and very comfortable. The KT2 has enough of everything to make them a great option on-court, and it comes in at a reasonable price as well."
14768,347,293,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,For $120 this is a great deal. The Anta KT2 is really amazing to play basketball in. I have no complaints at all - I love it!
14769,347,32,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"High-quality materials, great cushioning and phenomenal traction. The Anta KT2 were my first Chinese sneakers and I really enjoyed them on-court!"
14770,347,33,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,It’s a combination of the great herringbone pattern and a really sound rubber compound.
14771,347,293,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Traction has a lot of bite, but attracts a fair amount of dust."
14772,347,32,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Really, really solid traction - works on all surfaces."
14773,347,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Anta has really improved things with the cushion of the KT2.
14774,347,293,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Cushioning is really soft and offers good impact protection.
14775,347,32,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Foam pads in the forefoot and heel combined with an EVA midsole.  The cushioning is soft and comfortable but still offers enough responsiveness.
14776,347,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"While Fuse is not my personal preference, it gets the job done and it’s durable as hell."
14777,347,293,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,Materials are not premium but get the job done.
14778,347,32,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,Fuse and mesh materials are really comfortable but a little bulky and not very breathable.
14779,347,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Midfoot shank, outrigger, heel counter and great containment of the upper do a solid job."
14780,347,293,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"Large outrigger is great, but there is no additional ankle support from the higher cut."
14781,347,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"Support and lockdown are solid and get the job done, but there is nothing special."
14782,347,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Super snug fit and solid lockdown - gets the job done.
14783,347,293,10.0,2017-01-01,fit,The fit was perfect for me.
14784,347,293,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,Outdoor use should be okay.
14785,347,293,2,2017-01-01,width,The shoe is a little bit narrow.
14786,348,86,9.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"The Rare Metal gives you premium materials, great cushioning, and damn near great traction."
14787,348,176,8.6,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"If you are looking for a highly cushioned, low profile and low-cut rocket for your feet, especially on clean courts, then the Rare Metal is your pick."
14788,348,522,8.4,2017-12-27,expert_overall,"The Rare Metal is a shoe that does nearly everything well. If the traction was more consistent and more aggressive, I wouldn’t hesitate to put this into my rotation maybe even into my top 5."
14789,348,293,8.2,2018-01-26,expert_overall,"I was really disappointed by the traction - otherwise this is a great shoe. If you play on clean courts, then the BrandBlack Rare Metal is a great choice."
14790,348,86,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,"Good, not great. The blade traction does its job well."
14791,348,176,9.0,2017-12-27,traction,"On clean floors, you are great, but the rubber attracts a lot of dust."
14792,348,522,7.0,2017-12-27,traction,"Personally, I don’t like how the traction plays because I prefer more bite and consistency."
14793,348,293,5.0,2018-01-26,traction,"On dusty courts, the traction is absolutely horrible, and you need to wipe extremely hard to get a few good stops."
14794,348,86,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,"The Jetlon EVL felt more responsive and slightly bouncier without the instability, which in this case, is super comfy."
14795,348,176,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,"Jetlon EVL has a bouncier, livelier feeling, and provides great court feel."
14796,348,522,9.0,2017-12-27,cushion,BB calls this Jetlon EVL or Plus and I really like it a lot.
14797,348,293,9.0,2018-01-26,cushion,"Really, really nice premium cushioning that feels similar to Adidas' Bounce cushioning."
14798,348,86,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,The Jacquard upper on the Rare Metal feels great on foot.
14799,348,176,9.0,2017-12-27,materials,One thing Brandblack has never skimped on is materials.
14800,348,522,8.0,2017-12-27,materials,I personally don’t mind the slightly stiffer upper but I know lots of people want a sock-like upper.
14801,348,293,9.0,2018-01-26,materials,The upper is freaking nice!
14802,348,86,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"Everything you need, and nothing that you don’t."
14803,348,176,7.0,2017-12-27,support,"Support isn’t overbearing, just enough to where you don’t have to worry."
14804,348,522,9.0,2017-12-27,support,"Stability is excellent thanks to a flat outsole, forefoot outrigger and a stable heel that easily passes my heel test."
14805,348,293,9.0,2018-01-26,support,Nasty outrigger and supportive upper material make you feel very secure.
14806,348,86,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The shoe sculpts around your foot very well.
14807,348,176,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,"Spot on, in every way."
14808,348,522,9.0,2017-12-27,fit,The fit in the midfoot is also fantastic and my wide feet filled the forefoot just fine.
14809,348,293,9.0,2018-01-26,fit,The fit is absolutely amazing - no dead space at all!
14810,348,293,0.0,2018-01-26,outdoor,Outdoor use is probably not very good.
14811,348,522,4,2017-12-27,width,The Brandblack Rare Metal is a little wide.
14812,348,293,3,2018-01-26,width,Perfect for my feet.
14813,348,522,4,2017-12-27,size,These run a little long lengthwise.
14814,348,293,4,2018-01-26,size,Go down half a size.
14815,349,33,9.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,The Curry 3 is a great shoe on-court. Especially speedy guards will enjoy their time in these. If you’re a fan of the Curry 1 and 2 then you’ll likely love the 3.
14816,349,32,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I rank the Curry 3 above the Curry 2 and the Curry 2.5 but only by a very slim margin. There are some improvements, but overall the shoe performs very similar."
14817,349,176,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"You get great traction, Charged cushioning, and great lockdown after a short break in. If you are looking for a quick response and death-grip sticky soles, look no further."
14818,349,755,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Steph obviously values traction and light-weight support and the Curry 3 gives you exactly that. The cushion setup is highly responsive but delivers only average impact protection.  To me, the Curry 3 falls just short of being a top-tier on-court performer."
14819,349,739,8.8,2018-01-29,expert_overall,Am I happy with how the shoe performed? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes!
14820,349,486,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, I really enjoyed the Curry 3 and hooped in them a lot. They definitely got the job done! I really expect a lot from Under Armour going forward!"
14821,349,522,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,The Curry 3 is a solid and smooth shoe that performs well in every category but nothing outstanding. Slightly softer cushioning than the Curry 2/2.5 and softer materials but not an upgrade overall.
14822,349,293,8.2,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I really enjoyed the shoe. The traction in dusty conditions was a little lackluster. Other than that, it's a really nice shoe with amazing materials, good support and decent cushioning."
14823,349,6,8.0,2017-12-27,expert_overall,The Curry 3 is a good performer on the court. I recommend these if you like firm and responsive cushioning.
14824,349,772,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Despite the great build quality and solid materials, the Curry 3 is a shoe that didn’t work for my play style. If you’re a fast-paced guard that loves court feel (like Steph Curry himself) you’ll probably enjoy this shoe. However, more explosive players and those who need more impact protection should probably look elsewhere."
14825,349,773,8.0,2022-04-11,user_overall,"The traction is amazing! I’ve had this shoe for a very long time. And, it still seems to have perfect traction. Comfort is not so great my foot after playing basketball has had blisters from the sides of the shoe where the laces go through. The fit is slightly small for me but other than that shoe is amazing."

14830,349,33,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Herringbone is utilized once again, and like the Curry models that have come before the 3, traction is beastly."
14831,349,32,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction is really solid but takes a little to break in.
14832,349,176,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,I was able to drive and cut and never slipped.
14833,349,755,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Under Armour has always been fantastic when it comes to traction, but it just took things to a whole other level with the Curry 3."
14834,349,739,9.0,2018-01-29,traction,"Even when the court is dusty, it still plays great with minimal wiping."
14835,349,486,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction performs just as well as the Curry 2 did.
14836,349,522,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Traction on clean floors is great. As dust accumulates just be ready to wipe.
14837,349,293,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Great traction on clean courts, but the fine grooves make it hard to wipe off dust."
14838,349,6,8.5,2017-12-27,traction,I did not slip once!
14839,349,772,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The Curry 3 has a traction pattern that doesn’t feel great, but performs decently well."
14840,349,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushion is pretty firm and impact protection is minimal. Court feel is awesome.
14841,349,32,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushion is plush at first but bottoms out rather fast. Court feel is very responsive.
14842,349,176,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Charged Cushioning provides very little bounce or impact protection.
14843,349,755,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,This time around the responsive foam cushioning is a little more forgiving.
14844,349,739,8.5,2018-01-29,cushion,Charged cushion was used and can be felt in the heel area with a firmer Micro-G foam used throughout the rest of the midsole.
14845,349,486,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushioning is on the firmer side and gives you great court feel.
14846,349,522,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Charged is back again and even though it’s the same name, it feels slightly softer than before especially in the heel."
14847,349,293,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The Charged cushioning is nothing special. Very little impact protection and bounce but great court feel.
14848,349,6,7.0,2017-12-27,cushion,The Charged cushioning is a little firmer than in other Under Armour models. I would have liked a little more impact protection.
14849,349,772,7.0,2017-01-01,cushion,I was greeted with a firm ride that provided a lot of court feel.
14850,349,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Other than the traction, the materials are my favorite part of the shoe."
14851,349,32,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"The materials are soft, lightweight and fairly supportive too."
14852,349,176,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Under Armour has brought us Threadborne, its version of a woven upper material, and it’s nice."
14853,349,755,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Under Armour's new Threadborne material, fuse overlays and the fan-favorite Anafoam are a great mix of materials."
14854,349,739,8.5,2018-01-29,materials,There's nothing to complain about.
14855,349,486,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,Materials could have been better. Too much fuse for my liking.
14856,349,522,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Threadborne is a nice,  tightly wound textile upper that provides a pliable fit without being stretchy."
14857,349,293,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,The materials are the strong point of the shoe. After breaking the shoe in the upper feels really soft and conforms to your feet.
14858,349,772,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The materials department is where I think the Curry 3 really shines.
14859,349,33,9.0,2017-01-01,support,As long as the shoe fits you properly you shouldn’t have any issues with support.
14860,349,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"For some strange reason, I felt rather wobbly in this shoe as the base is rather narrow."
14861,349,176,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The Curry 3 hits you smack in the face with support features.
14862,349,755,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"If you’re a quick guard who needs a shoe that has a lot of support features but still has a lightweight feel, the Curry 3 will be exactly what you’re looking for."
14863,349,486,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Heel counter and carbon fiber mid-foot shank do a good job. Once you put your shoe on, you're locked in!"
14864,349,522,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The support of the Curry 3 worked well as I felt like my ankles were just propped up straight at all times.
14865,349,293,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Support is very good. My ankles felt safe at all times.
14866,349,6,9.0,2017-12-27,support,No side-to-side movement and great lockdown of the heel.
14867,349,772,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"As a whole, the support and lockdown on the Curry 3 would work really well for any type of player, big or small."
14868,349,33,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The slight asymmetrical lacing system provides the midfoot with a wonderfully secure feel.
14869,349,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,It's kind of stiff and snug when you first put them on. But after breaking them in the fit really well.
14870,349,176,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Lockdown in the heel is super solid and the midfoot lacing straps you down into the shoe.
14871,349,755,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,The fit doesn’t really conform to your foot. I felt like my foot was sitting in the shoe as opposed to the shoe feeling like an extension of my foot.
14872,349,739,9.0,2018-01-29,fit,Asymmetrical lacing makes adjusting your laces pretty easily.
14873,349,522,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Overall, the fit is great but worsens with play due to the laces loosening."
14874,349,293,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,Doesn't fit as well as the previous Curry models. Too much toe room for me.
14875,349,6,7.5,2017-12-27,fit,I didn't like the dead space in the toe box.
14876,349,772,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The tongue is nice and plush, and the top of the shoe provides a good amount of cushion when surrounding the ankle."
14877,349,293,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,The rubber is hard but not very thick. Outdoor use should be okay.
14878,349,6,0.0,2017-12-27,outdoor,I don't recommend playing outdoors in these.
14879,349,293,4,2017-01-01,width,Too much toe room for my liking.
14880,349,6,3,2017-12-27,width,The Curry 3 is regularly wide.
14881,349,522,3,2017-01-01,size,I went true to size with my normal 11.
14882,349,293,3,2017-01-01,size,Go true to size.
14883,349,6,3,2017-12-27,size,Definitely go true to size.
14884,350,86,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Does the shoe perform? It absolutely does. I do like how the shoe adapts to my movements while providing adequate lockdown and support. The cushion feels fine but I was expecting something totally different or new, and the traction has its suspect points."
14885,350,486,8.6,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I wasn't impressed by the Air Jordan 31 because the traction really holds them back. Other then that it is a pretty solid shoe and get's the job done.
14886,350,649,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"I’ve come to expect the best from the modern Air Jordan line when it comes to performance, and the Air Jordan 31 fully delivers. There are a few matters of personal preference, but overall, there is little to criticize."
14887,350,32,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I did like the super soft woven upper and the responsive cushion.But inconsistent traction and pain in the heel from the achilles padding keep this shoe from being in my regular rotation.
14888,350,33,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,Each piece of the shoe is great. Put them together and it’s not a perfect match. The biggest issue to tackle is how to get full length unlocked Zoom to be more stable underfoot.
14889,350,293,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,These shoes are absolutely incredible - aside from the catastrophic failure that is the traction. I can't play in these because the traction is literally dangerous.
14890,350,701,7.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, my opinion of the Air Jordan 31 is really mixed. Definitely a drop-off from previous models, but still a solid performance sneaker."
14891,350,551,8.0,2021-10-25,user_overall,"Nearly everything was great, except for the traction, had one real bad slip and lost confidence in it. Cushioning has bottomed out slowly and the support isn't really that good. Mad comfortable though."
14892,350,256,9.2,2023-07-10,user_overall,"I got the low with hard rubber, so traction wasn't as big of a deal and it was much more durable. Love the zoom setup, it feels unbelievably bouncy and is very fun to play in"
14893,350,458,5.0,2023-03-22,user_overall,these shoes are all bark no bite  loudest squeak ever but  feels like ice skateing (NO JOKE)
14894,350,447,8.8,2022-04-18,user_overall,
14895,350,86,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"It’s not bad, but it’s not great — it’s inconsistent."
14896,350,486,6.0,2017-01-01,traction,"Decent traction at best, don't be surprised if you do a split on dusty courts."
14897,350,649,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"When the sole of the Air Jordan 31 is clean, the herringbone-style pattern offers a secure grip, but it had a tendency to pick up dust fast."
14898,350,32,6.0,2017-01-01,traction,The traction is very inconsistent. Any type of dust - you are in trouble!
14899,350,33,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"While it’s nowhere near as bad as the XXX’s traction, it’s still pretty inconsistent."
14900,350,293,1.0,2017-01-01,traction,A catastrophic failure!
14901,350,701,7.0,2017-01-01,traction,"The traction is not terrible, but it is far from good."
14902,350,86,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"It’s been a while, but I’m glad full-length Zoom Air is back."
14903,350,486,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Full length zoom and Flightspeed tech - Jordan brand is giving the customer the best they have to offer
14904,350,649,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Overall impact protection has improved. But it comes at a price. Court feel, while still good, isn’t at the level of previous years."
14905,350,32,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Full length zoom is awesome as always, while still providing court feel and responsiveness."
14906,350,33,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Impact protection, court feel, responsiveness, it’s all there in the XXXI. The thing I wasn’t a fan of is how unstable it feels."
14907,350,293,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"Full-length zoom cushioning, super-low to the ground and very responsive."
14908,350,701,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"The cushioning wasn't as outstanding as in the last three Air Jordan models, but it is still one of the best options for impact protection."
14909,350,86,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,This is what the Air Jordan XXX should have been.
14910,350,486,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,Flyweave is my favourite upper material - I wouldn't change anything!
14911,350,32,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"Performance upper feels nice, but I don't like the synthetic leather in the heel."
14912,350,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,"The materials on the XXXI are easily its best attribute, this is performance woven done right."
14913,350,293,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,Man is this upper nice. Premium materials and very comfortable fit.
14914,350,701,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,I like the materials.
14915,350,86,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The support is good but not outstanding.
14916,350,486,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"I didn't have any issues in the support department, but the retro shilouette doesn't help with containment."
14917,350,649,9.0,2017-01-01,support,Innovative ankle support combined with the lateral forefoot’s large outrigger makes for a stable and reassuring playing experience.
14918,350,32,6.0,2017-01-01,support,Support and lockdown might be the biggest disappointment in this shoe for me. Full length zoom feels wobbly and doesn't offer stable platform for quick cuts.
14919,350,33,7.0,2017-01-01,support,Too much space in the toe box and full length Zoom feels wobbly.
14920,350,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,"Support is nice, no complaints there. Lockdown is really good too."
14921,350,701,8.0,2017-01-01,support,Support is not phenomenal but definitely good.
14922,350,86,10.0,2017-01-01,fit,I’d say the fit is one of my favorite aspects of the shoe.
14923,350,486,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The overall fit is nothing less than great.
14924,350,649,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The AIr Jordan XXXI provides a sublime fit that’s easy to slide on and off, and can be laced as loose or tight as your personal preferences allow."
14925,350,32,8.0,2017-01-01,fit,"Overall comfort of the fit is solid, but I had severe pain in the heel when lacing too tight."
14926,350,33,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,Some lace adjustments will be needed during your first couple of games to ensure you’re getting the best and most secure fit.
14927,350,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Fit is so awesome you forget you are wearing shoes.
14928,350,701,6.0,2017-01-01,fit,The first time I wore them they absolutely tore my heel up.
14929,350,293,50.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,I think outdoor you should be fine because the rubber is hard.
14930,350,486,4,2017-01-01,width,If you have a wider foot you are going to enjoy these
14931,350,293,4,2017-01-01,width,Slightly wide and roomy in the toe box.
14932,350,486,3,2017-01-01,size,Jordan Brand is really good at making their shoes fit true to size.
14933,350,293,3,2017-01-01,size,Go true to size.
14934,350,701,3,2017-01-01,size,Go true to size.
14935,351,176,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Best. KD. EVER. Seriously. Besides a little less support than some need, there are no problems with this shoe. Traction — excellent. Cushioning — beyond excellent. Materials — the best Nike has to offer."
14936,351,293,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"Overall, definitely get these. The cushioning feels really nice, the traction is good and the materials are super premium."
14937,351,32,9.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,At $150 the KD9 is a good deal considering the great performance it delivers.
14938,351,701,8.8,2017-01-01,expert_overall,I think this is the best overall sneaker out right now.  A very versatile shoe that works for all type of players.
14939,351,486,8.5,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The shoe gets the job done and performs very well. Unfortunately, the upper material is not very comfortable and the price is a little too high for what you get."
14940,351,33,8.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"You receive solid traction, fantastic cushion, great materials, and if you get the size that fits you best, you’ll also receive a solid and secure fit for optimal support."
14941,351,522,8.4,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"The KD 9 is a shoe everyone will enjoy, mainly because the fit, comfort and cushioning is amazing right out of the box. However, I need a little more support, containment, and traction during competitive play."
14942,351,649,8.0,2017-01-01,expert_overall,"As a performance sneaker, it just didn’t work for me. Above all else, the one thing I need to have in a shoe is confidence, and I didn’t have it in the KD 9."
14943,351,775,7.8,2022-11-09,user_overall,"These shoes had the worst traction of any shoe I’ve ever played in very hard to cut in and I was constantly sliding, slipping, and falling"

14948,351,176,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The solid outsole provides some of the best traction on clean and dusty courts.
14949,351,293,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,"If you are playing on a clean court, the traction performs quite well. On a dusty court, it requires frequent wiping."
14950,351,32,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,The honeycomb traction pattern performs well.
14951,351,701,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,Got the job done on any court I played on.
14952,351,486,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,Never have I been so surprised by the traction. This sh*t is incredible!
14953,351,33,9.0,2017-01-01,traction,The rubber compound used on the versions with solid rubber outsoles will offer you incredibly sticky traction.
14954,351,522,8.0,2017-01-01,traction,The KD 9 features a honeycomb pattern and it works great on clean floors or when wiped.
14955,351,649,10.0,2017-01-01,traction,"From the first wearing on, the KD 9 offered outstanding on-court grip."
14956,351,176,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"This is the bouncy, responsive, energy returning Nike Zoom cushioning. Dang perfect."
14957,351,293,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The full-length Zoom Air cushioning system feels amazing.
14958,351,32,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The Zoom cushioning is a different animal! Almost perfectly well balanced.
14959,351,701,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,I fell in love with the full-length articulated Zoom.
14960,351,486,9.0,2017-01-01,cushion,The cushioning setup is very well balanced.
14961,351,33,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"This sh*t is amazing. Smooth transition, ultimate impact protection, and ultimate responsiveness."
14962,351,522,10.0,2017-01-01,cushion,Cushioning is fantastic and is truly the highlight of the shoe from a visual and performance standpoint.
14963,351,649,8.0,2017-01-01,cushion,"From a pure comfort standpoint, the cushioning is outstanding. But the downside is that it’s a little too soft when it comes to performance."
14964,351,176,10.0,2017-01-01,materials,"True knit that is flexible, comfy, and requires no break-in time."
14965,351,293,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,The upper is very soft yet pliable and the padding inside of the shoe feels very premium.
14966,351,32,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,Flyknit material is awesome.
14967,351,486,7.0,2017-01-01,materials,There is too much Flyknit and it is knitted way too tight. Form a performance standpoint I don't feel it.
14968,351,33,9.0,2017-01-01,materials,This is the best iteration of Flyknit we’ve received on a Nike Basketball model to date.
14969,351,522,8.0,2017-01-01,materials,I think this upper feels better than previous glue backed Flyknits by a mile.
14970,351,176,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"Basically, a sock with a sole, so support structures are not at the front of the design ideas here."
14971,351,293,9.0,2017-01-01,support,The low-cut shoe doesn't offer much ankle protection but the Flyknit material provides a lot of support and lockdown.
14972,351,32,8.0,2017-01-01,support,The upper materials are so soft that containment suffers.
14973,351,701,7.0,2017-01-01,support,I am a little disappointed by the lockdown and support. I am not a big fan of the one piece booty setup.
14974,351,486,8.0,2017-01-01,support,"Support felt great, heel lockdown is good thanks to the padding."
14975,351,33,7.0,2017-01-01,support,The Nike KD 9’s support is essentially riding on one key aspect: the overall fit.
14976,351,522,7.0,2017-01-01,support,"Support isn’t anything special, in fact, it is a little lackluster."
14977,351,649,7.0,2017-01-01,support,The KD 9 fell short of the lockdown I was looking for. I also found that the shoe was greatly in need of an outrigger.
14978,351,176,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,I almost pulled my shoulder out of socket getting them on
14979,351,293,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,Materials wrap around the foot nicely and there is no dead space in the toe area.
14980,351,701,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,If you don't have very wide feet then these are really comfortable.
14981,351,33,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,"They’re hard as hell to get on my foot, but once they’re on I’m locked in perfectly."
14982,351,522,9.0,2017-01-01,fit,The upper really hugs the foot and gives a great one to one fit.
14983,351,649,7.0,2017-01-01,fit,"The KD 9 features a full bootie-style upper, which is a construction method I’m not a fan of."
14984,351,293,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,This outsole is probably not ideal for outdoor use.
14985,351,522,0.0,2017-01-01,outdoor,I do not recommend these for outdoors due to the softness of the rubber as well as the Flyknit upper.
14986,351,293,2,2017-01-01,width,The shoe is rather narrow.
14987,351,701,2,2017-01-01,width,They are slightly narrow like most Kd's.
14988,351,486,1,2017-01-01,width,Not recommended for wide-footers.
14989,351,522,2,2017-01-01,width,The KD line has always run narrow.
14990,351,701,3,2017-01-01,size,They fit true to size.
14991,351,486,3,2017-01-01,size,You want to go true to size.
14992,351,522,4,2017-01-01,size,"If you have a narrow foot, go down half a size, if you have a wide foot stay true to size."
