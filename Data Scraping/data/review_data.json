Great traction and excellent fit with firmer than normal Kobe line cushioning that needs break in but feels decent after. When you see the price of $160, you\u2019ll expect more since other comparative shoes out there under that price point are offering nicer materials than the mesh on the Kobe AD."

The visual appeal of Kobe\u2019s first post-retirement sneaker is off the charts but this is a performance review, and in that regard, the Kobe A.D. is more than just a disappointment."
