36,4,9.4,Snkr Tech Talk,2025-04-28,I love the Way of Wade 808 5 Ultra. Li-Ning stepped up and improved an already good shoe. This shoe has my favourite drop-in midsole ever.

24,4,8.6,RicheeKim,2025-04-20,The Li-Ning Way of Wade 808 5 Ultra is worth the money. The drop-in midsole feels crazy and is one of the best available.

37,5,7.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2025-02-28,"I can recommend the Zion 4 for people with narrow feet. It's bouncy, quick, and fun to play in."
47,5,7.6,Lukas Simoner,2025-04-12,"The Jordan Zion 4 is a slightly below-average performer. It doesn't work for my feet, but I like the cushioning setup."
24,5,7.4,RicheeKim,2025-03-12,"The Jordan Zion 4 is not it for me. My main issue is the heel slippage, but the traction was also lacking."
44,5,7.2,TommyLiu,2025-05-11,"The Jordan Zion 4 is more spacious and smoother, but the traction and materials are a letdown."
36,6,8.4,Snkr Tech Talk,2025-05-27,"I can recommend the Nike KD 18. The traction performs well, but the cushioning could be better."

44,6,8.2,TommyLiu,2025-05-04,"I enjoy the Nike KD 18. There are no gimmicks. The traction and cushioning get the job done, and I like the extra structure of the midfoot caging."
47,6,8.2,Lukas Simoner,2025-05-27,I like the Nike KD 18. It's more comfy but also slightly more clunky. There's not much difference from the KD 17.
37,6,7.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2025-02-28,"The Nike KD 18 feels similar to the 17. I'm not a fan of the shank plate, but the shoe's overall performance is decent."
43,7,8.6,The Sole Drop,2025-03-12,I thoroughly enjoyed playing in the Nike LeBron NXXT Genisus. The only downsides are the shoe's short length and restrictive heel. Everything else performed exceptionally well.
36,7,8.2,Snkr Tech Talk,2025-04-03,"The Nike LeBron NXXT Genisus is a good basketball shoe, but not at the retail price. The traction is consistent, and the support and fit feel secure. I wish they kept the heel Zoom bag, though."

37,7,8.1,Foot Doctor Zach,2025-02-28,The Nike LeBron NXXT Genisus has consistent traction with plenty of rigid containment.
24,7,8.0,RicheeKim,2025-02-28,The Nike LeBron NXXT Genisus is a good shoe. My only issue was some sliding with the traction on dirty courts. Everything else performs well.
44,7,7.8,TommyLiu,2025-02-28,I didn't like the Nike LeBron NXXT Genisus much. I prefer the previous iteration because of its better traction performance and upper.
43,8,8.8,The Sole Drop,2025-04-12,"The Nike G.T. Cut 3 Turbo is a fantastic performer. It has a high price tag, but I love the traction and upgraded support."

24,8,8.2,RicheeKim,2025-04-12,"The Nike G.T. Cut 3 Turbo has improved support and lockdown, but the increased price is not worth it."

24,9,8.6,RicheeKim,2025-01-27,The 361 Joker 1 offers a lot of quality and performance for the price. I love the well-balanced cushioning. The only downside is the traction performance on dust.
47,10,9.0,Lukas Simoner,2025-02-09,"I love playing in the Adidas Harden Volume 9, and the improvements to the fit and support are welcomed."
37,10,9.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2025-01-09,"The Adidas Harden Volume 9 is much more nimble than it looks. The cushioning is springy, and the upper construction is impressive for stability."

48,10,8.2,DG Hoops,2025-01-29,I like the Adidas Harden Volume 9. The performance is consistent with the previous two models.
24,10,8.2,RicheeKim,2025-02-15,The Adidas Harden Volume 9 is a good performance shoe but doesn't do enough to differentiate itself from its predecessor.
45,10,8.2,KicksContestWorld,2025-06-01,The Harden Vol 9 has excellent cushioning and traction. It could be better with a more refined fit.
43,10,8.0,The Sole Drop,2025-01-19,"I didn't enjoy playing in the Adidas Harden Volume 9 because of its poor traction performance and clunky heel section. However, the support and cushioning are solid."

37,11,8.1,Foot Doctor Zach,2025-01-27,The Puma Scoot Zeros 2 provides a lot of confidence when moving side to side and changing directions. I like the implementation of the traction and midsole.
24,11,7.8,RicheeKim,2025-02-03,The Puma Scoot Zeros 2 is a solid pickup for the price. There are better shoes but the traction and support are decent.

44,12,8.4,TommyLiu,2025-03-03,"I was not a fan of the AR 1, but I enjoy the Rigorer AR 2. The traction is excellent, and the upgraded cushioning is fantastic."
29,12,8.2,MARKCHES,2025-02-15,"The Rigorer AR 2 is an upgrade from the AR 1. The main improvement is the cushioning, which is softer and bouncier."
39,12,8.0,Evan Miranda [weartesters.com],2025-01-29,The Rigorer AR 2 is a significant upgrade over its predecessor. It's a well-rounded shoe with excellent traction and responsive cushioning. The support and build also hold up well.
37,13,8.6,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-12-21,I like the Curry Fox 1 better than the signature Curry 12. The added shank makes the midsole cushioning feel more lively.
43,13,8.4,The Sole Drop,2024-12-27,"I love the look of the Curry Fox 1, and the performance is similar to any other Curry or Under Armour shoe that features Flow foam. The traction excels on clean courts and the cushioning is adequate."
24,13,8.2,RicheeKim,2025-01-09,The Curry Fox 1 is a solid performer in its price range. It's a good pickup if you play on mostly clean courts.
44,13,7.6,TommyLiu,2025-01-27,"The Curry Fox 1 is a decent low-top guard shoe. It's nothing special, and its performance features are mostly average."

44,14,7.6,TommyLiu,2024-12-21,"If you like an affordable and usable performance shoe, the Adidas Dame Certified 3 is a solid pick. The traction and cushioning were decent for me."
24,14,7.4,RicheeKim,2024-12-21,I can't recommend the Adidas Dame Certified 3 because of the heel slippage and traction on dust. I do like the Bounce foam and fit though.
43,14,7.4,The Sole Drop,2024-12-21,Do not get the Adidas Dame Certified 3. I can't recommend it. The full-length Bounce is soft but I had issues with the traction and heel slippage.

47,15,9.0,Lukas Simoner,2025-01-05,"The Way of Wade All City 13 is already one of the best shoes available. The traction and cushioning are both excellent, and the fit feels better."
44,15,8.8,TommyLiu,2024-12-21,The Way of Wade All City 13 is an excellent performer. I would put the shoe in the A or S tier. It's firm on the outside and comfy on the inside.

37,16,8.9,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-12-21,The Way of Wade Shadow 6 is fantastic for getting up and down the court. The shank and midsole foam also provide a lot of snap and pop.
44,16,8.8,TommyLiu,2024-12-21,"The Way of Wade Shadow 6 performed beyond my expectations. The shoe offers insane value for the price, particularly with cushioning."
24,16,8.6,RicheeKim,2024-12-21,The Shadow 6 is a top-tier budget performer. The traction and cushioning are outstanding at this price.

39,16,8.0,Evan Miranda [weartesters.com],2025-01-24,The Way of Wade Shadow 6 is an impressive shoe for the money. Its cushioning and traction are more than worth the price.
39,17,9.5,Evan Miranda [weartesters.com],2025-01-09,"The Anta KT 10 is the best basketball shoe of 2024. It's an elite, versatile, well-rounded performer with little to no flaws."
37,17,9.4,Foot Doctor Zach,2025-01-09,The KT 10 is awesome. It's nearly pitch-perfect. I love the stopping power and outsole flange.
44,17,9.0,TommyLiu,2025-01-09,I would place the Anta KT 10 in the S-tier of basketball shoes. It's an elite shoe with fantastic cushioning and traction.
29,17,8.6,MARKCHES,2025-02-03,"Anta made minor adjustments to the KT 10, which made a big difference. The cushioning and support are impressive."
43,17,8.0,The Sole Drop,2025-01-09,"I love the cushioning and stability of the Anta KT 10, but the traction on dusty courts made me feel unsafe."
7,18,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2024-11-11,"Everything about the Tatum 3 is decent. Some aspects could be better like the traction, but it works well overall."
24,18,7.8,RicheeKim,2024-11-11,I can't recommend the Jordan Tatum 3. The containment issues and dust pick-up turned me away. I do like the comfortable cushioning.
1,18,7.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2024-11-11,The Jordan Tatum 3 is Jayson Tatum's best signature sneaker so far. The cushioning and traction perform well.
46,18,7.8,Jeremy Jones,2024-11-22,This is the best Tatum shoe to drop so far. It's nice to see a brand slowly improve.
36,18,7.8,Snkr Tech Talk,2024-11-22,I recommend waiting for a sale before getting the Jordan Tatum 3. It's the best shoe in the lineup because of the traction. The cushioning could be better and the support is decent.
44,18,7.7,TommyLiu,2024-11-11,The Jordan Tatum is smoother than previous models. The outsole composition is better and I like the material usage.
37,18,7.2,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-11-11,"When the Tatum 3 grips, it offers light, quick pop and performance. The problem is the shoe is inconsistent."
43,18,7.2,The Sole Drop,2024-11-11,The Jordan Tatum 3 let me down. I can't recommend it because of the inconsistent traction and the lack of support.
37,19,8.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-11-11,"The Nike LeBron 22 has excellent traction and cushioning. The support also feels good. The main con is the weight, but the shoe feels great despite being heavier."
36,19,8.8,Snkr Tech Talk,2024-11-22,"The Nike LeBron 22 is a very nice performer. The biggest downfall is traction on dirty floors, but the cushioning and support are awesome."
43,19,8.8,The Sole Drop,2024-11-22,"I enjoy playing in the Nike LeBron 22, especially on clean courts. The cushioning is outstanding, the fit feels great, and the support and lockdown contain me well."
24,19,8.6,RicheeKim,2024-11-22,I really enjoy the Nike LeBron 22. My only issue is the dust pickup on the traction. All of the other features are outstanding.
44,19,8.5,TommyLiu,2024-11-11,"I would say the Nike LeBron 22 took a step back. It feels slower and heavier. However, the traction and cushioning still feel good."
29,19,8.4,MARKCHES,2024-11-14,The Nike LeBron 22 isn't much improved in performance compared to the LeBron 21. It's still an impressive and dependable shoe with improved materials.
45,19,8.4,KicksContestWorld,2025-06-13,"The Nike LeBron 22 is a solid performance shoe for heavier players, thanks to its excellent stability and cushioning."
7,19,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2024-11-11,"Despite all the tech, the Nike LeBron 22 feels mid to me. Traction and support are solid, but I'm not a fan of the materials and comfort."
36,20,8.5,Snkr Tech Talk,2024-11-02,"I enjoyed playing in the Nike Ja 2. It's Kobe-esque, but there are other better-cushioned options available. The traction plays well, and I like the snug fit."
44,20,8.4,TommyLiu,2024-11-01,"The Nike Ja 2 is one of the most practical, no-BS Nike shoes. The shoe's strengths are traction, weight, and agility."
37,20,8.4,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-10-11,The outsole traction performance makes the Nike Ja 2 a fun shoe. The downside is this shoe feels too similar to the Sabrina 2.
45,20,8.4,KicksContestWorld,2025-05-17,The Nike Ja 2 is a good basketball shoe. I enjoyed the traction performance. The shoe is best for lightweight and shifty players.
1,20,8.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2024-10-11,"I like the Nike Ja 2 slightly more than the Ja 1. The outsole is grippy and the cushioning feels a bit better. Like all Nike basketball shoes lately, this reminds me of Kobe shoes."
29,20,8.0,MARKCHES,2024-10-23,"The Nike Ja 2 is a lightweight performance shoe with awesome traction. However, the impact protection is lacking."
24,20,8.0,RicheeKim,2024-10-30,The Nike Ja 2 is a solid performer with decent traction and cushioning.
43,20,7.8,The Sole Drop,2024-10-16,"I prefer the Nike Ja 1 because of the fit, but the Ja 2 provides a softer, minimal upper. The comfort feels decent, and the traction performs well."
46,20,7.8,Jeremy Jones,2024-10-23,The Nike Ja 2 feels like a generic and basic Nike sneaker. The traction plays well and is the best feature.
47,20,7.6,Lukas Simoner,2025-04-12,"There are two main changes to the Nike Ja 2. It feels less supportive, but the materials are better. The traction remains a strong point."
36,21,8.5,Snkr Tech Talk,2024-11-26,"The Puma MB.04 is the best-fitting shoe in LaMelo Ball's line. However, the rest of the performance feels like last year's model. I like the traction and support."
37,21,8.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-10-11,The Puma MB.04 is surprisingly nimble for a maximalist shoe. It feels slightly more stable and the grip plays well.
24,21,8.0,RicheeKim,2024-10-11,"The Puma MB.04 is a solid shoe for the price. My main complaints are the bulk and the design. I like the traction and impact protection, though."
44,21,7.4,TommyLiu,2024-11-14,"Hopefully, Puma can improve next time because the MB.04 is an inconsistent performer. Dust heavily affects the traction, and the support is lacking."
43,21,7.4,The Sole Drop,2024-11-22,"I'm unsure what direction Puma is taking the MB.04. It's comfortable and cozy, but the traction and fit could be better."
19,22,9.0,PureKicks,2024-11-11,"The outdoor durability is the only knock on the Nike Kobe 9 Elite Low Protro. It has the best traction, and I like the materials and support."
43,22,8.8,The Sole Drop,2024-11-11,The Nike Kobe 9 Elite Low Protro breaks in extremely nicely. The traction and cushioning are very enjoyable to play in. My main complaint is the narrow fit.
1,22,8.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2024-11-11,The Nike Kobe 9 Elite Low Protro is the same as the original but with a new drop-in midsole. The traction is elite and the cushioning feels better.

44,23,8.4,TommyLiu,2024-11-11,The Anta Shock Wave 6 is nothing special but has no downsides. All of the features work well. This feels like Anta's take on a Nike Kyrie Low.
29,23,8.2,MARKCHES,2024-11-11,The Anta Shock Wave 6 is a low-to-the-ground and responsive performer. The shoe is lightweight and responsive but lacks impact protection.
24,24,8.6,RicheeKim,2024-09-21,"The New Balance Hesi Low V2 is an impressive shoe for the price. The traction, materials, and cushioning are all solid. This shoe is a definite improvement from the V1."

37,25,8.5,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-09-21,The Adidas Dame 9 feels buttery and quick. It allows extra freedom while maintaining the containment.
46,25,8.4,Jeremy Jones,2024-09-23,Adidas came through with the Dame 9. I enjoyed the traction and fit; the cushioning also feels plush and comfortable.
29,25,8.4,MARKCHES,2024-10-16,The Adidas Dame 9 is a solid performer because of its traction and support. My only complaint is the flat heel-to-toe transition.
32,25,8.4,ShadeSnSoleS [Youtube],2025-07-12,The Adidas Dame 9 feels premium without needing premium materials. I'm a big fan of the price.
19,25,8.0,PureKicks,2024-09-21,"I love the traction, cushioning, and support of the Adidas Dame 9, but the breathability does take a few points off."
43,25,8.0,The Sole Drop,2024-09-29,I felt quick and comfortable playing in the Adidas Dame 9. This shoe has the best cushioning and support for an Adidas basketball shoe.
39,26,8.5,Evan Miranda [weartesters.com],2024-10-16,"The Nike Giannis Immortality 4 is a solid performing shoe, especially for the price. The traction performance is great, and the outsole will last outdoors."
47,26,8.4,Lukas Simoner,2024-10-21,The Giannis Immortality 4 provides much better value for money than the main signature. The traction performance is reliable and the cushioning feels better this year.
44,26,8.2,TommyLiu,2024-09-21,"The Nike Giannis Immortality 4 is an excellent shoe for the price. The materials are cheap but stronger, which was much needed."
24,26,8.0,RicheeKim,2024-09-21,I like the price reduction for the Nike Giannis Immortality 4. The materials update makes this shoe more comfortable performance-wise.
37,26,7.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-09-21,"The Giannis Immortality 4 is a better shoe than the Zoom Freak 6, for the money, because of the containment and shank usage. I like the bottom-light midfoot setup, too."
43,26,7.8,The Sole Drop,2024-09-21,There are better shoes out than the Nike Giannis Immortality 4. The pros are the price and the supportive materials if you can deal with a break-in period.
37,27,9.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-09-21,"The New Balance TWO WXY V5 is an upgrade on the V4, but only a minor upgrade. The traction and cushioning are fantastic."

37,28,9.1,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-11-11,"The Anta KAI 1 Speed has fantastic push-off power, and the shoe propels you in whatever direction you're moving. I like the fit, materials, and outsole tread."
36,28,9.0,Snkr Tech Talk,2024-11-11,"The Anta KAI 1 Speed is an awesome shoe to play in. I felt protected in all movements, the traction was superb, and the cushioning was impressive. This is a top-five shoe for 2024."
43,28,9.0,The Sole Drop,2024-11-11,The quality and tech of the Anta KAI 1 Speed are top-notch. It feels like the KAI 1 but it's lower to the ground and more responsive.
44,28,8.5,TommyLiu,2024-11-11,"The Anta KAI 1 Speed is faster, lighter, and stiffer than the KAI 1. This shoe is better for players who prioritize fast play styles."
24,29,8.4,RicheeKim,2024-08-06,"The Jordan Luka 3 is a solid performance hoop shoe, especially at this price. The traction bites well, and the cushioning is comfortable. Make sure to wipe the dust, though."
48,29,8.4,DG Hoops,2024-08-07,"The Jordan Luka 3 performance surprised me. The design and construction make the fit and support feel better, and the materials do the job well."
43,29,8.2,The Sole Drop,2024-08-06,I love the performance of the Jordan Luka 3 on clean courts. Dust pickup drops the performance slightly but it's still a solid shoe.
46,29,8.2,Jeremy Jones,2024-08-17,"There's nothing special about the Jordan Luka 3, but there's nothing that will hinder you as well."
44,29,8.2,TommyLiu,2024-10-10,"The Luka 3 doesn't feel premium, but the performance is decent. It caters to slower-paced players or spot-up shooters. I like the containment and traction."
45,29,8.2,KicksContestWorld,2024-11-26,"The Jordan Luka 3 is best for bigger players. I like the stability, lockdown, and impact protection."
36,29,8.2,Snkr Tech Talk,2025-03-12,"The Jordan Luka 3 is my favourite from his lineup so far. I love the support and containment, as well as the traction and cushioning."
37,29,8.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-08-06,"The Jordan Luka 3 is my favourite shoe within the Luka signature line. The traction is tacky, and the upper materials are supportive. I also like the Cushlon foam in the midsole."
44,30,9.0,TommyLiu,2024-08-17,"The Jordan 39 is a top-tier hoop shoe because of its traction, cushioning, comfort, and fit. The only downside is the lack of an outrigger."
36,30,8.8,Snkr Tech Talk,2024-08-06,"The Air Jordan 39 is an excellent basketball shoe. The cushioning, fit, and materials are outstanding. However, there's a lack of side-to-side stability and breathability."
1,30,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2024-08-07,"The Air Jordan 39 is so close to being fantastic. The cushioning performance is great, and I love the materials, but the lack of stability hurts."

24,30,8.0,RicheeKim,2024-08-19,"I like everything about the Jordan 39 except for the support and stability. The cushioning is very comfortable, but I wish they would've put in a shank."
47,30,8.0,Lukas Simoner,2024-09-08,"The Air Jordan 39 performance was not what I expected. The cushioning is too soft for smaller, shiftier players, but the materials are impressive."
45,30,7.6,KicksContestWorld,2025-01-19,"I wouldn't recommend the Air Jordan 39 for bigger players because of the lack of stability. However, the traction is elite and the cushioning is decent."
43,30,7.4,The Sole Drop,2024-08-11,"I didn't mind the Air Jordan 39 on clean courts, but there are a few too many negatives. The dust pickup causes sliding, and there's a lack of lateral stability."
37,30,7.2,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-08-06,"The Air Jordan 39 is a fantastic shootaround shoe. The comfort is outstanding, but the lack of stability makes cutting and planting difficult."
36,31,8.7,Snkr Tech Talk,2024-09-15,"I love the bang for your buck the Adidas AE 1 Low offers. My main gripe is the fit and sizing. However, the cushioning, traction, and support are all impressive."
1,31,8.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2024-09-05,"The AE 1 Low is still a solid performer. I enjoy the Lows better because of the fit, but the main difference between the two shoes is cushioning. The Lows are firmer."
32,31,8.4,ShadeSnSoleS [Youtube],2025-07-05,"I like how the Adidas AE 1 Lows perform. The cushioning and support cater well to my play style, and I didn't have any issues with the traction."
24,31,8.2,RicheeKim,2024-08-18,"The Adidas AE 1 Low is a great shoe for the price. It's not for everyone because of the lack of impact protection, but I like the traction. The materials feel better on feet too."
37,31,8.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-08-18,The Adidas AE 1 Low feels clunky enough to be noticeable on feet. The shoe performance doesn't feel the same without the bigger ankle collar and upper materials.
48,31,7.8,DG Hoops,2024-08-18,"The Adidas AE 1 Low's fit throws off the shoe's performance. It affects the fit and heel containment. However, the traction and other support features are solid."
44,31,7.0,TommyLiu,2024-08-18,The AE 1 Low is the most disappointing release of 2024. The lack of heel slippage and fit affects performance too much. The cushioning also feels like a downgrade.

44,32,8.0,TommyLiu,2024-09-19,I don't have much to complain about with the Nike Zoom Freak 6. The traction is the best feature. I highly recommend waiting for sales.
43,32,7.8,The Sole Drop,2024-09-15,"I like the comfort of the Nike Freak 6 but the quality could be better for a signature shoe. The cushioning is low to the ground, and the traction performs well after breaking in."
24,32,7.8,RicheeKim,2024-09-23,The Zoom Freak 6 has decent performance. There are only minor issues with dust accumulation and heel slippage. The rest of the features perform well.
45,32,7.8,KicksContestWorld,2025-02-15,"The Zoom Freak 6 is adequate. The materials are crappy, and the upper is too flimsy to keep you contained. It's a shoe meant for light and shifty guards."
37,32,7.2,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-08-24,"The Nike Zoom Freak 6 feels great initially. However, wear and tear can deteriorate the build quality and containment."
1,33,8.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2024-09-21,"The Curry 12 is the best overall performer in his lineup. This pair blew my mind. The cushioning is improved, while the support and traction remain fantastic."
44,33,8.6,TommyLiu,2024-09-29,"The Curry 12 is an impressive performer. Flow foam provides excellent traction, and the materials are comfortable and supportive."
43,33,8.4,The Sole Drop,2024-09-21,"The Curry 12 is extremely light and performs similarly to the Curry 11. The traction plays well on clean courts, and the cushioning is best for responsiveness."
37,33,8.3,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-09-21,The Curry 12 performance is similar to the 11 but is more comfortable. The fit and upper materials are much improved.
24,33,8.2,RicheeKim,2024-09-21,You should know what to expect with a Curry shoe. The Curry 12 is in line with the rest of the Flow lineup. I love the performance on clean courts.

37,35,8.4,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-11-11,"The Way of Wade Ice Blood 2 feels snappy and springy during play. However, the shoe has some stiffness and fit issues."
36,35,8.3,Snkr Tech Talk,2024-11-11,The Wade Ice Blood 2 is a fun performer with a problematic fit. I like the low-profile cushioning setup and the support features.
44,35,8.0,TommyLiu,2024-11-11,"I had a lot of fun playing in the Ice Blood 2. It's designed as a guard shoe with its lightweight and responsive cushioning. However, the materials are cheap, so beware."
24,35,7.8,RicheeKim,2024-11-11,I think the Wade Ice Blood 2 is a good shoe for the most part. The main drawbacks are the narrowness and lack of torsional stability. I like the cushioning setup though.
43,35,7.4,The Sole Drop,2024-11-11,"The Li-Ning Wade Ice Blood 2 is fluid, minimal, and lightweight. The cushioning is also solid, but the materials are cheap and the fit is off."
37,36,9.4,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-06-23,The Li-Ning Way of Wade 11 are much nimbler and make movement easy. I like the weight and setup. The traction and cushion are also incredible.
36,36,9.3,Snkr Tech Talk,2025-01-02,This shoe is a pleasure to play in. The Way of Wade 11 has almost no weaknesses outside of the lack of breathability.
44,36,9.0,TommyLiu,2024-06-23,I'm very excited for the Li-Ning Way of Wade 11. It's a top-tier performance shoe. The traction and cushioning are incredible. The main downside is the lack of breathability.
43,36,9.0,The Sole Drop,2024-08-03,The Li-Ning Way of Wade 11 is an incredible performance shoe. The traction and cushioning combination is outstanding. My only complaints are the slight bulkiness and lack of ventilation.

48,36,8.6,DG Hoops,2024-07-15,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade 11 is another outstanding performance shoe. I love the traction performance. The cushioning is also amazing, it's smoother but not as bouncy."
45,36,8.5,KicksContestWorld,2024-07-12,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade 11 is a great performance hoop shoe. It doesn't live up to the WoW 10, but the support and materials are impressive."

37,37,8.3,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-07-15,The Adidas D.O.N. Issue 6 offers elite balance. The shoe is light and the traction is impressive for surefooted players. The main downside is the lack of snap and springiness.
36,38,9.2,Snkr Tech Talk,2024-07-19,I love the performance of the Nike Sabrina 2. The traction and cushioning performance are outstanding. Beware of potential quality control issues. I experienced some peeling on my first pair.
24,38,8.6,RicheeKim,2024-07-19,The Nike Sabrina 2 is a solid performer. It reminds me of the Nike Kobe 5. The traction is fantastic; the only downside is the lack of impact protection.

37,39,8.2,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-07-15,The Nike GT Hustle 3 is an easy shoe to play in. It gets off the ground easily because of the cushioning setup and the shank. My only concern is the stability.
43,39,8.0,The Sole Drop,2024-08-03,"The Nike GT Hustle 3 has ample cushioning and reliable traction. However, the lack of stability hurts, and the cushion can be excessive."
36,40,7.4,Snkr Tech Talk,2024-08-06,I think you're getting hosed with the Nike GT Hustle Academy. There's not enough tech to offer much performance.
1,40,7.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2024-08-06,The Nike GT Hustle Academy is a head-scratcher. There's no tech in the cushioning and support features. The only upside is the lightweight feeling and decent traction.

37,41,8.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-08-06,There is so much packed into the Li-Ning Wade 808 4 Ultra. The materials and cushioning help you get off the floor and move side-to-side quickly.
43,41,8.6,The Sole Drop,2024-08-06,"The Wade 808 4 Ultra is an incredibly balanced shoe. The upper is minimal, I love the cushioning, and the traction is elite. My only complaint is the heel area feels clunky."

48,42,8.6,DG Hoops,2024-07-15,"The Nike Kobe 8 Protro is a lightweight, minimal shoe. The traction performs very well, but the cushioning is not geared for impact protection. The shoe is better suited for shifty guards."

37,47,8.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-05-26,The Nike KD 17 is my favourite KD model since the 14. It's flexible and has impressive traction performance. My only complaints are the short shank and the long fit.

33,49,7.8,Soled Out Reviews,2024-03-17,The Jordan Tatum 2 is an upgrade on the Tatum 1. I like the Air Strobel cushioning; the support and lockdown were also solid. I don't like the materials and the traction is not top-tier.

37,55,7.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2024-01-29,"You need the proper skill set to use the Nike G.T. Cut 3. The shoe plays fast, and the cushioning is bouncy. Torsional support and lateral containment can be an issue."

42,64,8.8,Jackson Bayer [weartesters.com],2024-03-17,Li-Ning's Way of Wade All City 12 is one of the most well-rounded shoes of the year. The shoe is the entire package with its excellent traction and balanced cushioning.

43,65,8.4,The Sole Drop,2023-12-06,"The Adidas D.O.N. Issue #5 thrives on fit, support, and lockdown. The performance of the materials aids with the containment, and the traction is decent."
37,65,8.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-12-14,The Adidas D.O.N. Issue #5 is a Jekyll and Hyde type of shoe. I felt quick and snappy but also stiff at the same time. The foam could be better.
44,65,8.0,TommyLiu,2023-12-14,"I like the Adidas D.O.N. Issue #5 aesthetics more than the performance. The traction is excellent, but the cushioning feels B-tier."
37,66,7.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-12-06,"The New Balance Hesi Low feels agile and light around the court. The traction warms up well, and it benefits lighter, shiftier players."
44,66,7.6,TommyLiu,2023-12-06,"The New Balance Hesi Low has no weaknesses, but there are also no standout features. I enjoy the cushioning, and the support is solid."

29,67,8.8,MARKCHES,2023-10-05,The Nike LeBron 21 is still an impressive performer. The materials and support are improved to provide additional containment and stability.
43,67,8.8,The Sole Drop,2023-10-13,"The Nike LeBron 21 feels quick. I love playing in these shoes. The traction is outstanding, and the cushioning feels comfortable and responsive. It's not the most breathable, though."
46,67,8.8,Jeremy Jones,2023-11-25,"The Nike LeBron 21 is an elite basketball performer. The materials feel more premium, while the traction and cushioning remain top-tier."
24,67,8.8,RicheeKim,2024-01-21,I highly recommend the Nike LeBron 21. It has fantastic cushioning and impressive traction. It's also fun to play in.
47,67,8.8,Lukas Simoner,2024-03-22,The Nike LeBron 21 keeps the impressive traction and cushioning from last year. I prefer the knit material on the previous LeBron shoe.
33,67,8.8,Soled Out Reviews,2023-10-19,"I think the Nike LeBron 21 is a dope sneaker once it's broken in properly. The traction is top-tier, and the cushioning provides plenty of impact protection."

2,68,8.5,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2023-11-08,"New Balance did not disappoint with the TWO WXY V4. The cushioning feels better this year, and the traction continues to perform well."
44,68,8.2,TommyLiu,2023-10-22,The New Balance TWO WXY V4 is the complete package. It has the cushioning and traction to cater to all positions and play styles.
42,68,8.2,Jackson Bayer [weartesters.com],2023-11-03,"I prefer the New Balance TWO WXY V3 to the TWO WXY V4, but the impact protection and outsole durability are better on the V4. The fit is tricky, but the traction remains reliable."

33,69,8.5,Soled Out Reviews,2023-10-22,"The Jordan Zion 3 provides enough stabilization for all positions. I love the cushioning, and the traction works as long as you wipe the dust."
43,69,8.4,The Sole Drop,2023-11-11,"I love the Jordan Zion 3. Everything about the shoe is fantastic except for the narrow fit. The traction was solid, and this shoe has my favourite drop-in midsole."
36,69,8.3,Snkr Tech Talk,2023-11-03,"The Jordan Zion 3 is one of the best supportive low-top shoes. Jordan Brand knocked the drop-in midsole out of the park, too."
37,69,8.2,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-10-25,"The Jordan Zion 3 is a departure from his previous shoes. It's a minimal shoe that maintains the structure, but it's still heavy. The traction and outsole are the best features."
46,69,8.0,Jeremy Jones,2023-10-28,"The Jordan Zion 3 is made for stockier players who play with pace. All the features perform as intended, but there is a break in period."
29,69,8.0,MARKCHES,2023-11-11,"The Jordan Zion 3 is a minimal shoe with outstanding support and lockdown. I enjoy the drop-in midsole, but the shape and fit of the shoe are off."
45,69,7.6,KicksContestWorld,2024-05-19,The Jordan Zion 3 didn't meet our expectations. The only upside is the cushioning. Jordan Brand takes a step back on this model.
44,69,6.8,TommyLiu,2023-12-25,"I'm disappointed with the Jordan Zion 3. The comfort is poor, and there's a lot of pinching because of the fit."
11,70,9.5,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2024-01-11,The Anta KT 9 is one of my top shoes this year. The traction and cushioning are outstanding. None of the features disappoint.

43,70,8.4,The Sole Drop,2023-11-15,"The Anta KT 9 is a shoe I enjoyed playing in. My only concerns are breathability and dust pickup. The comfort feels good, and the traction performs well."
37,70,8.3,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-11-17,The Anta KT 9 is an incredibly stable and containing shoe. The playability is impressive if you have the right foot shape. The impact protection is one of the best.
43,71,8.2,The Sole Drop,2023-12-06,"The Nike LeBron Witness 8 caters to quick play styles. The traction is outstanding, but the cushioning could be better."
44,71,7.8,TommyLiu,2023-12-06,"The Nike LeBron Witness 8 is a solid, budget performer. I think it's a good pickup if you can get it at a discount. The cushioning is soft, and the traction works."
39,71,7.5,Evan Miranda [weartesters.com],2023-12-18,The LeBron Witness 8 is low to the ground and responsive. The materials and support feel better than the previous Witness 7.
37,71,7.2,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-12-06,The Nike LeBron Witness 8 does not inspire confidence. The lateral containment was not secure enough because of the lack of containment features.
44,72,8.2,TommyLiu,2023-12-06,"The Li-Ning Wade Shadow 5 is a decent performer, especially for a budget shoe. Stability is the best feature, while traction and cushion take some time to warm up."
43,72,8.0,The Sole Drop,2024-01-15,"I like the Li-Ning Wade Shadow 5 as a budget performer. The shoe is impressive for lockdown, and the traction and cushioning are decent."
37,72,7.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-12-06,"The Li-Ning Wade Shadow 5 is better for outdoor use. The shoe caters to larger, more powerful players that can generate more force for traction and cushioning."
44,73,8.0,TommyLiu,2023-07-24,"The Adidas Trae Young 3 has bouncy cushioning and consistent traction, but the heel slippage and stability subtract from the overall performance."
37,73,8.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-08-13,"The Adidas Trae Young 3 is a niche shoe. It's best for lightweight, bouncing players. The cushion is soft and bouncy, while the traction grips. Beware of the durability outdoors."
39,73,8.0,Evan Miranda [weartesters.com],2023-09-16,The Adidas Trae Young 3 is a massive improvement. It feels light and reactive. The best features are the grippy outsole and stability. The main downside is the lack of impact protection for heavier players.
43,73,8.0,The Sole Drop,2023-11-03,"The Adidas Trae Young 3 is a solid performer, but I didn't enjoy how bulky it is. The cushioning feels good, and the stability is better than expected, though."
33,73,7.8,Soled Out Reviews,2023-08-25,"The Adidas Trae Young 3 is a decent shoe. It has impressive traction and cushioning. The materials and comfort are lacking, though."

44,74,8.2,TommyLiu,2023-09-28,"Not much has changed with the Puma MB.03. The heel impact protection is slightly improved, while the other features remain solid."
37,74,8.2,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-11-11,"The Puma MB.03 is such a comfortable shoe. The foam is forgiving, and I enjoy the upper material setup. The main downside is the weight."
46,74,8.0,Jeremy Jones,2023-12-09,"If you like consistency, consider the Puma MB.03. LaMelo Ball's line is consistent. All of the features work well together."
43,74,7.8,The Sole Drop,2023-11-08,"I didn't enjoy playing in the Puma MB.03. Puma took steps back with the materials, traction, and cushioning. Support and lockdown are impressive, though."
43,75,8.8,The Sole Drop,2023-09-28,"The quality is impressive for the price of the 361 AG 4. The traction is outstanding, the lockdown is solid, and the cushioning feels incredibly comfortable. This is the best value shoe for it's price."
37,75,8.6,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-09-28,"The 361 AG 4 takes some breaking in, but they play like a maximalist shoe with soft cushioning and support. I enjoyed the shiftiness it provides for being a beefier shoe."
44,75,8.6,TommyLiu,2023-12-14,The 361 AG 4 feels best for quick play styles. I had a fantastic experience playing in this shoe because of the traction and cushioning.
29,75,8.4,MARKCHES,2023-09-28,"Aaron Gordon's fourth shoe, the 361 AG 4, is a step up in performance. The cushioning is the best since the first shoe, and the traction is top-tier."
36,76,8.9,Snkr Tech Talk,2023-11-08,"The Under Armour Curry 11 is Steph Curry's best signature model. I enjoyed the updated cushioning. The fit and support are stellar, and the traction is fantastic."
42,76,8.8,Jackson Bayer [weartesters.com],2023-12-28,"I love the Curry 11 more than the Curry 10. The traction is elite, and the cushioning caters to shooters nicely. It uses the best iteration of Flow, too."
33,76,8.8,Soled Out Reviews,2023-11-08,The Under Armour Curry 11 is the perfect guard shoe. It has you covered in all directions and through all movements.
44,76,8.6,TommyLiu,2023-10-23,The Under Armour Curry 11 keeps all the best performance features of the Curry 10. It's a fantastic shoe with excellent traction.
43,76,8.6,The Sole Drop,2023-11-08,"The Curry 11 is more of the same. The traction continues to be impressive, and the cushion is low to the ground and responsive."
37,76,8.4,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-10-28,"The Curry 11 is an improvement from previous models. I love the Flow foam setup, the weight, and the traction. It's more laterally stable as well."
36,77,9.0,Snkr Tech Talk,2023-09-11,"The Air Jordan 38 is a fantastic basketball shoe. The cushioning, materials, and support are all improved. This is the best Jordan Brand shoe in a while."

44,77,8.6,TommyLiu,2023-09-03,The Air Jordan 38 is well worth the price. The traction and cushioning feel great. Jordan Brand paid attention to the details to make this shoe a top performer.
41,77,8.6,Allen Sison [weartesters.com],2023-09-16,"I enjoyed playing in the Air Jordan 38. The traction performed well on all courts, and the cushioning is some of Jordan's best. My outsole did separate, which was disappointing."
43,77,8.4,The Sole Drop,2023-08-30,"The Air Jordan 38 is responsive and comfortable. The traction performs on clean courts, and the support is solid. I prefer the cushioning setup with bounce and comfort, too."

43,78,8.4,The Sole Drop,2023-08-25,"The Nike KD 16 feels quick. It's a solid shoe, but there are better options on the market. The cushioning is soft, and the traction plays well on clean courts."
36,78,8.3,Snkr Tech Talk,2023-10-05,"The Nike KD 16 is a decent performer. The cushioning was a letdown compared to last year, but the support and lockdown felt fantastic."

44,78,8.2,TommyLiu,2023-09-12,"The Nike KD 16 doesn't pack the same punch as previous models. It's still a solid performer because none of the features are bad, but it's not exceptional."
24,78,8.2,RicheeKim,2024-01-15,"I recommend the Nike KD 16 if you're playing on clean courts. The shoe is comfortable, and the cushioning feels incredible. Avoid playing on dusty courts, though."
37,78,7.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-07-24,"The Nike KD 16 is plush and maneuverable, but it doesn't have the bite of the previous models."

37,79,7.6,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-12-09,The Nike Giannis Immortality 3 feels lively and springy. The materials and midsole likely hold up better for lighter guards. It caters to shifty players well because of the weight and traction.

29,81,8.0,MARKCHES,2023-10-13,The Nike Sabrina is a solid performer and a minimal sneaker. It's better for players with low-to-the-ground play styles because of the thin cushioning and grippy traction.
44,81,7.8,TommyLiu,2023-11-11,"The Nike Sabrina 1 has inconsistent traction and a snug fit, but playing with this cushioning setup is enjoyable."
44,82,8.6,TommyLiu,2023-09-20,I'm impressed by the comfort of the Nike G.T. Hustle 2. The shoe provides speed and agility while remaining responsive and bouncy.

33,82,8.0,Soled Out Reviews,2023-10-10,"The Nike G.T. Hustle 2 is a decent performer. I didn't have any issues with the traction, and the lockdown is outstanding once you get your feet in and the laces completely secure."
43,82,8.0,The Sole Drop,2023-10-19,"The Nike G.T. Hustle 2 is a smooth and nimble-feeling shoe. There's a lot of court feel, and the cushioning feels well-rounded, too. The material quality is the main downside."
37,82,7.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-09-20,The Nike G.T. Hustle 2 is a lightweight and bouncy performer. The cushioning and outsole setup make getting up and down the court easier.
29,82,7.8,MARKCHES,2023-09-28,"There's a lot of promise with the Nike G.T. Hustle 2, but it misses the mark slightly. The shoe plays low and responsive thanks to the full-length Zoom cushioning."

29,129,8.0,MARKCHES,2022-12-04,The Puma Rise NITRO is a comfortable performance shoe with flexible materials and dependable traction. I only wish the cushion was plusher.
44,129,8.0,TommyLiu,2023-04-13,"The Puma Rise NITRO is a solid performer. It's not top-tier, but not awful. The stability is the main standout feature, and the traction performs well."
37,129,8.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2023-08-24,The Puma Rise NITRO is a fantastic shoe for players who contort their feet during movements. The shank plate and foam make the shoe feel bouncy and springy.
24,131,7.8,RicheeKim,2022-08-08,"The Nike Giannis Immortality 2 is a solid shoe for the price. The materials are the best part of the shoe, and the support is there, too."
6,131,7.8,The Sole Brothers,2022-08-16,"The Nike Giannis Immortality 2 is a step back from the original. I had fit issues caused by the materials. The traction performed well after breaking it in, and the cushioning is responsive, though."
30,131,7.5,Gavriel Rupert Dela Cruz [weartesters.com],2022-07-07,"The Nike Giannis Immortality 2 is a solid budget offering, but it doesn't do much to differentiate itself from last year's Immortality 1. It has the traction, fit, and support needed for most guards on a budget."
39,131,7.5,Evan Miranda [weartesters.com],2022-08-08,"The Nike Giannis Immortality is an above-average performer but remains a very good budget option. The traction and responsive cushion make it a solid pick for smaller, quicker players."
40,132,9.4,RunStretchTech,2022-08-04,"The Jordan Luka 1 is as good as it gets. It is one of the best performance basketball shoes available right now. Traction, cushion, and support are all there."
37,132,8.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-07-26,"Luka Doncic's first signature shoe, the Jordan Luka 1, is a performance-first shoe. While they're newer and you're using them for intense play, they'll perform phenomenally."
36,132,8.6,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-08-08,"I really enjoyed playing in the Jordan Luka 1. The big drawback is that the cushioning could be better. Otherwise, it's a fantastic buy at retail because the traction is top-tier, and the support features perform well."
1,132,8.5,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2022-07-26,"The Jordan Luka 1 features a brand new cushion setup called Formula 23, and it feels fantastic under your feet. The traction also feels tacky, and the support is there. This shoe has all the makings of a solid performer."
41,132,8.5,Allen Sison [weartesters.com],2022-08-24,"The Jordan Luka 1 is an excellent performer. Players who value traction, fit adaptability, and court feel will enjoy this shoe."
33,132,8.5,Soled Out Reviews,2022-09-15,"The Jordan Luka 1 is definitively a shoe I can recommend for guards. It has top-tier traction and feels comfortable on foot. You can't expect much cushioning, though."
7,132,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2022-10-16,"The Jordan Luka 1 makes you feel shifty and agile, and it's the perfect shoe for guards. The traction, support, and lockdown are standout features."
29,132,8.4,MARKCHES,2022-07-26,The Jordan Luka 1 is a stable hoop shoe that caters to players who prefer responsive performance. It offers extra support but isn't the bounciest.
34,132,8.2,LZ Hoops,2022-09-06,"Overall, I enjoyed playing in the Jordan Luka 1. The support and lockdown feel comfortable with every move I made, and the materials are lightweight."
32,132,8.2,ShadeSnSoleS [Youtube],2022-10-10,"The Jordan Luka 1 is a solid shoe for players who value stability. The traction is versatile, and the shoe is plenty supportive."
6,132,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2022-08-16,"I had a great time playing in the Jordan Luka 1 because of the traction. The shoe feels minimal and cozy, but the fit didn't work out for me."
45,133,9.2,KicksContestWorld,2023-05-04,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade 10 is the best performer of the season. It might be the best shoe we've ever tested. The cushioning feels perfect, and the fit and traction are excellent too."
37,133,8.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-07-26,The Li-Ning Way of Wade 10 is definitely an upgrade when compared to the Way of Wade 9. This shoe is a versatile performer that can play well for both nimble and aggressive players.
29,133,8.8,MARKCHES,2022-07-26,The Li-Ning Way of Wade 10 is a top performer for players that only play on indoor wooden courts. I had a lot of fun playing with this cushion and material setup.
6,133,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2022-08-08,"Overall, the Li-Ning Way of Wade 10 is such a fun shoe to play in. It feels quick, the support features are there, and the cushioning is fantastic."
41,133,8.8,Allen Sison [weartesters.com],2023-04-16,"The more I played in the Li-Ning Way of Wade 10, the more I became convinced they would be top-tier shoes. I love the reliable traction and bouncy cushioning."
46,133,8.8,Jeremy Jones,2023-08-18,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade 10 is a top performer. The traction grips, the cushioning is balanced, and the support is locked down."
1,133,8.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2022-08-08,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade 10 is a potential contender for the best basketball shoe of 2022. The cushioning is incredibly bouncy, the materials are lightweight, and the traction feels grippy."
40,134,8.2,RunStretchTech,2022-08-04,"The Nike Precision shoe is an excellent shoe for its price range. The shoe is comfortable, and my movement felt great in them."
6,134,7.8,The Sole Brothers,2022-08-04,"If you're looking for a lightweight and responsive shoe, the Nike Precision 6 is one of the best you can get for the money. Anybody that needs any cushioning should avoid this shoe, though."
24,134,7.8,RicheeKim,2022-08-04,I highly recommend the Nike Precision 6 for the price. It should be a solid option for outdoor play and players on a budget.
40,135,10.0,RunStretchTech,2022-08-08,"I had a lot of fun playing in the Puma MB.01 Lo. To me, these are the perfect basketball shoe. The traction and cushion are top-notch, and the stability is fantastic."
1,135,9.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2022-08-08,"The Puma MB.01 Low is one of the best and most versatile performance shoes on the market. It packs an aggressive traction pattern, balanced cushioning, and support features that get the job done."
36,135,8.2,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-08-08,"The Puma MB.01 is a fantastic shoe at a great price. The traction is reliable, and the cushion offers an impressive mix of court feel and impact protection."
6,135,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2022-08-16,"The Puma MB.01 Lo is not a shoe I can recommend over the mid-top version. It's still a solid shoe, but the traction didn't perform as well for me on the Lo compared to the original."
27,136,9.5,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2022-06-25,"The New Balance TWO WXY V2 provides a nearly flawless experience. Some players might prefer a bit more cushion, but I had no complaints. This shoe could be New Balance's best offering yet."
37,136,8.4,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-06-08,"The New Balance TWO WXY V2 is a fun shoe to play in, and it's a good shoe for players needing their feet to plant and grip in tight spaces such as under the rim."
6,136,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2022-06-25,"I really enjoyed playing in the New Balance TWO WXY V2. The traction is outstanding, and all other aspects of the shoe such as cushioning and support held their own."
24,136,8.2,RicheeKim,2022-06-16,I would say that the New Balance TWO WXY V2 is the best performer in New Balance's basketball lineup. Every performance aspect of the shoe is solid.
36,136,8.2,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-07-07,"The New Balance TWO WXT V2 is one of the best shoes available. It has one of the best traction setups I've ever played in, but be careful if you need a lot of lateral containment."
40,137,8.6,RunStretchTech,2022-07-07,"The Jordan Zion 2 is an excellent basketball shoe. I was balanced and supported the whole time. They weren't the most breathable and are a bit heavy, though."
1,137,8.5,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2022-08-04,"There's not much to complain about with the Jordan Zion 2. It's a low-to-the-ground, supportive basketball shoe with one of the best tractions available."
36,137,8.5,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-11-12,The Jordan Zion 2 has some of the best materials on a signature shoe to go along with being the most supportive shoe on the market.
29,137,8.4,MARKCHES,2022-06-25,"The Jordan Zion 2 has a better traction and cushion setup than the Zion 1, which makes this a great shoe to play in."
37,137,8.4,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-07-01,The Jordan Zion 2 is a solid shoe for players that like to operate in the paint and utilize lateral movement to their advantage. They are probably the best shoe for sturdy post players.

33,137,8.0,Soled Out Reviews,2022-07-26,"If you can try the Jordan Zion 2 on for size first, I'd recommend it as a performance basketball shoe. Just make sure that the Achilles pillows don't feel uncomfortable for you."
7,137,7.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2022-07-07,"In my opinion, the Jordan Zion 2 is worse than last year's model. The traction is decent, and the support was great. However, I didn't like the materials and cushioning was mediocre."
36,138,9.5,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-07-01,"I preferred playing in the Jordan 36 Low a bit more than the Jordan 36. It's a lightweight, breathable shoe that offers bouncy cushion and grippy traction."
6,138,9.3,The Sole Brothers,2022-07-01,"The Jordan 36 Low performs almost identically to the Jordan 36. It comes down to personal preference, and I like a low-top shoe better."
37,138,9.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-07-01,"The Jordan 36 Low is almost identical to the regular Jordan 36. The main difference is the Lows are not as supportive, but it has a more comfortable fit."
24,138,9.0,RicheeKim,2022-07-01,"The Jordan 36 Low is a must-buy for most players. I can't recommend it enough, especially for the price. It's comfortable, the traction is great, and the cushion is outstanding."
37,139,8.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-08-16,"The Under Armour Curry 4 FloTro features some of the tackiest traction on the market. It's a shoe meant for players who utilize footwork and movement, so they may not be the best for more explosive players."
6,139,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2022-07-26,"The Curry 4 FloTro provides amazing performance for the price. The materials are comfortable, and the traction is outstanding. This shoe will definitely be in my rotation."
24,139,8.6,RicheeKim,2022-08-16,The Curry 4 FloTro is a solid pickup. It's similar to the Curry 8 and 9 with fantastic traction. The only potential downside is the lack of impact protection.
44,139,8.6,TommyLiu,2023-05-04,A very impressive traction and cushion setup carries the Curry 4 FloTro. It's a great performer. Just be careful with sudden lateral cuts and stops.
6,140,7.6,The Sole Brothers,2022-05-27,"The Under Armour HOVR Havoc 4 Clone is a great shoe for clean courts, but beware if you primarily play on dustier courts."
24,140,7.4,RicheeKim,2022-05-27,The Under Armour HOVR Havoc 4 Clone is not a shoe I can recommend because of issues I had with the support. Everything else was pretty good. The shoe could've been much better with improved materials.
24,141,7.8,RicheeKim,2022-05-31,"For its price, the Nike Renew Elevate 3 is a solid performer. My only gripe with the shoe is the cushion. The shoe can be played indoors and outdoors without issues."
6,141,7.4,The Sole Brothers,2022-07-26,"I liked the Nike Renew Elevate 3, but I wouldn't say it's a top-tier performer. It's a great option if you're looking for a budget shoe."
37,141,7.2,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-06-16,"The Nike Renew Elevate 3 is a shifty shoe that's also fast in a straight line. The lateral containment also isn't the best. This shoe is a solid pickup for low-to-the-ground players, though."
39,141,7.0,Evan Miranda [weartesters.com],2022-06-04,The Nike Renew Elevate 3 will not disappoint you for the price. You can use it as a go-to budget-friendly outdoor hoop shoe.
40,142,8.8,RunStretchTech,2022-08-08,"The Nike Kyrie Low 5 might be my favourite shoe in the Kyrie lineup. Its traction, comfort, and support were fantastic for me. The only drawback is the breathability."
39,142,8.5,Evan Miranda [weartesters.com],2022-09-06,"The Nike Kyrie Low 5 is one of the best basketball shoes for lighter guards. It's an excellent performance shoe, but the lack of impact protection may not be the best for everyone."
6,142,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2022-05-09,"You'll feel quick and light on your feet in the Nike Kyrie Low 5. It does what every previous Kyrie Low model does, but it also features improved cushioning."

6,143,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2022-06-11,"The Nike KD 15 is an amazing performer. The shoe feels responsive because the traction is so damn good, and the cushion is bouncy. The only downside is that my heel doesn't feel the most locked down."
40,143,9.0,RunStretchTech,2022-07-07,"The Nike KD 15 is a magnificent shoe that I highly recommend. The traction is one of the best available, and the cushion is good to go right out of the box."
7,143,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2022-07-26,"The Nike KD 15 is almost a complete upgrade of the KD 14. The only downside is the heel slippage. Otherwise, the cushioning and traction are amazing."
38,143,9.0,SnB PH,2022-07-26,"I enjoyed playing in the Nike KD 15 a lot. I would highly recommend them. The traction is grippy and perfect for indoors, and the Zoom Strobel unit is bouncy, as usual."

33,144,8.8,Soled Out Reviews,2022-04-03,"The Nike LeBron 19 Low plays better than the high-top version of the shoe. The cushion setup is one of my favourites, while the support and traction are improved."
37,144,8.2,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-03-22,"The Nike LeBron 19 Low is best for centers and forwards, and if I'm being honest, I think they perform better than the highs."

29,145,8.2,MARKCHES,2022-03-29,The only downside of the New Balance Kawhi 2 is that I wish they kept the same cushion found on the Kawhi 1. Every other aspect of the shoe is on par or better than the previous model.
24,145,8.2,RicheeKim,2022-03-31,The New Balance Kawhi 2 is a solid performer for the price point. It's a step in the right direction for the Kawhi lineup but still isn't quite as good as the Omn1s.
6,145,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2022-04-12,"The New Balance Kawhi 2 is a solid shoe, but I wouldn't say it's my favourite. It's a lightweight, supportive, and minimal shoe."

6,147,7.8,The Sole Brothers,2022-03-16,"If the traction played better, the Jordan Why Not .5 would be a much better shoe. It checked all the boxes needed in a shoe, but the traction is a big con in my books."

24,149,8.4,RicheeKim,2022-02-21,"The Adidas Harden Vol 6 is the best Harden model I've played in, slightly edging out the Vol 1. There are improvements with both the traction and cushion. The only cons I can think of are the cheap-feeling materials and tight toebox."
37,149,8.2,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-02-21,The Adidas Harden Vol 6 is best for players looking to outwork their opponents with fast footwork. The cushion and traction offer a lot of versatility. Just be sure to avoid toe drags.

29,151,8.2,MARKCHES,2021-12-29,"The Jordan Zoom Separate is a solid budget-friendly shoe. The cushion setup provides lots of impact protection, and the traction grips well. The only downside is the quality of the materials isn't the greatest."
24,151,8.2,RicheeKim,2022-03-01,"The Jordan Zoom Separate is a must-cop for the price. It's a great performer and has a lot to offer. The traction is beastly, and the cushion provides a welcome balance of bounce and responsiveness."
30,151,8.0,Gavriel Rupert Dela Cruz [weartesters.com],2021-12-29,"The Jordan Zoom Separate is the perfect shoe for forefoot-heavy players. They have good traction, impact protection, and breathable materials that fit well."
35,152,9.0,Shoeware,2022-01-22,"The Puma MB.01 is a fantastic start to a signature shoe line. Traction and cushion are the highlights, but nothing to point out for negatives on this model."
7,152,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2022-07-01,"The Puma MB.01 is a solid, all-around hoop shoe with nothing to complain about besides the lack of premium materials. It features well-performing traction and cushioning at a reasonable price."
6,152,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2022-01-08,"LaMelo Ball's first signature shoe, the Puma MB.01, is amazing. I love playing in these. This is a versatile option for a number of different playstyles."
34,152,8.5,LZ Hoops,2022-01-04,The Puma MB.01 is one of the most comfortable shoes I've worn in a long time. I think these could be one of the best first signature shoes ever.
37,152,8.5,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-01-22,"LaMelo Ball's Puma MB.01 is an excellent all-around shoe that players who enjoy quick, nimbler movements will enjoy. The shoe offers solid traction, and the materials perform exceptionally."
32,152,8.5,ShadeSnSoleS [Youtube],2022-01-26,"Overall, the Puma MB.01 is a pretty damn good shoe. It offers strong traction, cushioning, and upper materials."
24,152,8.4,RicheeKim,2022-01-04,The Puma MB.01 is a shoe that I highly recommend. It has a great balance of everything and is really fun to play in.
25,152,8.3,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2022-01-04,"Although they aren't the sleekest, the Puma Melo MB.01 does provide great balance and comfort. The cushion is a perfect balance, and the materials do a great job of keeping your feet feeling nice."
33,152,8.2,Soled Out Reviews,2022-01-04,Puma did a great job of putting together LaMelo Ball's first signature shoe. The shoe is fun to play in and has little to no downsides.
36,152,8.2,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-02-01,I think the Puma MB.01 is a fantastic shoe at this price point. They might just be the best budget shoe out right now.
6,153,8.5,The Sole Brothers,2022-01-28,"The Nike Fly By Mid 3 is Nike's lowest-priced shoe, but don't let that fool you. This shoe was a pleasant surprise. I liked playing in these a lot more than expected."
24,153,8.0,RicheeKim,2022-01-28,"The Nike Fly By Mid 3 is a solid performance shoe at a low retail price. The cushion surprised me, and the traction is just what you want from a basketball shoe."
44,153,8.0,TommyLiu,2023-07-19,"The Nike Fly By Mid 3 provides a bit of everything. The traction is impressive for the price, and it feels minimal overall."
32,153,6.8,ShadeSnSoleS [Youtube],2022-03-25,"As much as I want to recommend the Nike Fly By Mid 3, I can't because of the fit and traction. It could still be worth it for those looking for an affordable budget option."
30,153,6.2,Gavriel Rupert Dela Cruz [weartesters.com],2022-02-28,"The Nike Fly By Mid 3 is an okay shoe for the price. There are better shoes at this price point, however. I'd only consider this if budget is your biggest factor."
45,154,8.6,KicksContestWorld,2023-04-13,The Adidas Harden Stepback 3 showed great results during our tests. The traction and cushioning will be solid for guards and wings.
37,154,8.4,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-07-26,"I was presently surprised with the Adidas Harden Stepback 3. They might be the best budget shoe in recent memory, especially for shifty guards that rely on heavy footwork."
40,154,7.8,RunStretchTech,2022-08-16,"The Adidas Harden Stepback 3 is a comfortable budget shoe. The traction was reliable, and I enjoyed how the materials felt."
6,154,7.8,The Sole Brothers,2022-12-22,"I had a good time playing in the Adidas Harden Stepback 3. The traction performed nicely, the cushion was responsive, and I enjoyed the fit. I do wish impact protection was better, though."
6,155,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2021-12-25,The Nike Kyrie 8 is an overall great feeling shoe. It provides balance with the weight while still remaining a quality performer. Cushioning and materials are the standouts for me.
38,155,8.8,SnB PH,2022-01-22,"The Nike Kyrie 8 is one of the better options from Nike this year. They give you solid traction if you keep them clean, and the underfoot cushion performs well."
32,155,8.6,ShadeSnSoleS [Youtube],2022-01-18,"I love the Nike Kyrie 8. They are the most comfortable and functional Kyrie model to date. The traction is one of the only aspects that doesn't improve from last year, but the rest of the shoe is excellent."
37,155,8.6,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-01-22,"The Nike Kyrie 8 performs well for players that want nimble footwork, control, traction and stability. Be aware that the shoe may not be the best for more explosive players."
29,155,8.4,MARKCHES,2021-11-25,"I really enjoyed playing in the Nike Kyrie 8. The cushioning setup is the best in the entire Kyrie lineup, and the traction performs well as always."
24,155,8.4,RicheeKim,2022-02-22,The Nike Kyrie 8 is a solid pickup for the price. The only downside is the break-in time needed for the traction to get going. Everything else about the shoe is awesome.
36,155,8.1,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-03-07,The Nike Kyrie 8 is my favourite Kyrie of all time. They are my favourite Kyrie model to play in. It should be a fantastic shoe for guards and players that don't need much torsional rigidity.
7,156,9.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2021-12-01,"The Under Armour Curry 9 is an overall improvement from the Curry 8. The traction and cushion remain fantastic, but the materials and support perform better in this year's model."
38,156,9.2,SnB PH,2022-03-06,"The Under Armour Curry 9 is one of my go-to shoes right now. The traction and cushion remain solid, and the materials are greatly improved. This shoe is definitely worth the price."
6,156,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2021-12-19,"The Curry 9 feels like a running shoe that has the lateral containment needed for basketball. The traction is top-tier, and the cushion feels responsive. I absolutely love playing in this shoe."
29,156,9.0,MARKCHES,2022-01-18,"The Curry 9 is pretty similar to the Curry 8 for the most part. However, there is an improvement in the materials used this year; this leads to improved support and fit."
24,156,8.8,RicheeKim,2021-12-09,"Overall, the Curry 9 is an amazing performer. Everything about the shoe is an improvement from the Curry 8."
37,156,8.8,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-01-22,"The Curry 9 provides a fantastic grip for traction, and the cushion performs well in most situations. The materials feel durable and premium while remaining comfortable as well."
36,156,8.1,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-04-03,"If you enjoy a firmer cushion setup, I think you'll really enjoy the Curry 9. The traction and support are top-tier, and the materials get the job done."
38,157,8.6,SnB PH,2022-02-22,"Overall, I think the performance of the Adidas Dame 8 will suit many players. The shoe definitely delivers as my only gripes were minor."
24,157,8.4,RicheeKim,2022-01-06,"Overall, the Adidas Dame 8 is a solid pickup at its current price point. The inconsistency with the traction is the only downside. The cushion is an improvement from last year and the fit and support were perfect."
37,157,8.2,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-01-22,The Adidas Dame 8 is a great pick for players looking for easy push-off power or stability for hard pivoting. They're also versatile as they play well on different surfaces and can accommodate many foot shapes.
33,157,7.8,Soled Out Reviews,2022-01-08,"The Adidas Dame 8 could have been a strong performer but are held back by the traction. I had a lot of problems when it came to slippage. Other than that, the materials are comfortable, and the cushion provides a good amount of impact protection."
35,157,7.8,Shoeware,2022-01-22,"The Dame 8 plays very similarly to the Dame 7 even with the slight changes made. Still a well-balanced shoe overall, nothing stands out in a good or bad way."
6,157,7.4,The Sole Brothers,2022-01-11,"The Adidas Dame 8's Bounce Pro cushion setup is a joy to play in. However, other aspects of the shoe, such as traction and fit, are too inconsistent for me to recommend these."
32,157,7.2,ShadeSnSoleS [Youtube],2022-02-22,"I had high hopes for the Adidas Dame 8, but the traction didn't work for me, and the materials had a lot of room for improvement."
6,158,7.6,The Sole Brothers,2021-11-25,"The Nike Kyrie Flytrap 5 is a responsive and lightweight shoe. The traction is solid when on clean courts, and the cushion performs well enough for players that play low to the ground."
24,158,7.6,RicheeKim,2021-12-01,"The Nike Kyrie Flytrap 5 is a solid budget shoe for anyone who likes to play in a firmer and more responsive shoe. Almost all aspects performed adequately, but I wish the cushion and fit were better."
35,158,7.6,Shoeware,2022-01-22,"The Kyrie Flytrap 5 gives you about what you can expect from a shoe that is $90. The traction and cushion aren't anything special, but the support holds up well to play in."
30,158,5.0,Gavriel Rupert Dela Cruz [weartesters.com],2022-03-02,"The Nike Kyrie Flytrap 5 is a shoe that I can only recommend to wide-footers who enjoy minimal cushioning. For everybody else, there are a lot of better shoes out there."
38,159,8.9,SnB PH,2022-01-22,"The Nike LeBron 19 has plenty of tech and provides the best impact protection you can find right now. However, the traction can be suspect, and they are heavy."
29,159,8.8,MARKCHES,2021-11-19,"The Nike LeBron 19 is one of the best shoes in the LeBron line in recent years. The cushioning setup is lower to the ground without sacrificing any impact protection, but the biggest improvement is the stability that they feature."
33,159,8.5,Soled Out Reviews,2021-12-13,The Nike LeBron 19 doesn't quite fit my playstyle. They do provide impact protection and would be a solid pick for players that enjoy extra cushioning.
6,159,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2021-12-09,"Overall, the Nike LeBron 19 is a fun shoe to play in. It provides a crazy amount of bounce, and the cushion feels fantastic. The traction and weight do hold the shoe back, though."
37,159,8.4,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-01-22,"The Nike LeBron 19 offers a lot of tech, especially in the mid and outsole. It's a maximalist shoe that provides plenty of energy return, but it may not be the best shoe for those that rely on speed up and down the court because of the weight."
7,159,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2021-12-13,"The Nike LeBron 19 provides an unreal cushioning experience in terms of comfort, but the traction is disappointing. They remain one of the best shoes for those that value impact protection."
24,159,8.0,RicheeKim,2022-01-13,"Not even the crazy cushion and improved support of the LeBron 19 could make me recommend this shoe. For the price, the traction is just not good."
36,159,7.7,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-01-22,"Overall, I can't recommend the Nike LeBron 19 because of the traction. If you need an awesome cushion setup with a lot of support, this shoe could work for you."
24,160,8.0,RicheeKim,2021-11-14,"The Jordan One Take 3 is a solid pickup for the price. In my opinion, it is the best One Take model yet. The traction bites hard, and the cushion setup performs well for the price range."
6,160,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2021-11-19,I really enjoyed playing in the Jordan One Take 3. They felt like an extension of my foot with the grippy traction and responsive cushion. The materials are also minimal and support and lockdown were not an issue at all.
40,161,7.8,RunStretchTech,2022-06-06,"Overall, the Nike LeBron Witness 6 is comfortable and gets the job done for the price. It's a good option for outdoor play."
37,161,7.6,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-01-22,"The Nike LeBron Witness 6 has a lot of stability enhancements this year, but it can still be a bit unstable. However, this is a great shoe to beat up on outdoor courts."
6,161,7.2,The Sole Brothers,2021-10-25,"The Nike LeBron Witness 6 is a step down from the previous model in the Witness line. The shoe's instability combined with the underperforming traction leaves much to be desired. Even for the $100 price point, I can't recommend this shoe."
24,161,7.2,RicheeKim,2021-11-10,"The Nike LeBron Witness 6 is not a shoe I can recommend, even at its lower price point. The traction works well, but the lateral stability and cushion are lacking."
33,161,7.0,Soled Out Reviews,2021-11-02,"The Nike LeBron Witness 6 is a great-looking shoe, and can definitely be worn casually. However, I cannot recommend it for playing basketball. The cushion feels unstable and not supportive underfoot."
40,162,8.9,RunStretchTech,2022-06-06,"For the price, this is one of the better shoes I've played in this year. I was surprised at just how well the traction performed."
33,162,8.3,Soled Out Reviews,2022-03-09,"Overall, I would recommend the Nike Air Max Impact 3 for anybody in the market for a budget sneaker. The only downside is that the impact protection could be better."
24,162,8.0,RicheeKim,2022-03-09,"The Nike Air Max Impact 3 is just okay for the price. It's personally not my favourite, but I'd say go for it if you are a fan of Air Max units and strong traction."
36,163,9.4,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-01-22,"Overall, the Jordan 36 might be my favourite basketball shoe to play in right now. The traction is one of the best on the market and responsive cushioning."
36,163,9.3,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-05-22,"The Jordan 36 is a fantastic overall shoe. It offers traction, support, and cushioning. I don't think you can go wrong, especially considering the materials."
6,163,9.2,The Sole Brothers,2021-09-13,"The Jordan 36 is one of my favourite shoes to play in right now. They're lightweight, they have a nice bite, and I love the cushion setup."
1,163,9.1,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2021-09-13,"The latest entry in the Air Jordan line is a strong performer, just like the previous two models. The full-length Zoom Air Strobel is amazing. The traction is outstanding. Materials are durable. There really aren't any downsides to this shoe."
7,163,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2021-09-13,"Jordan brand continues to deliver with the 36. The traction is consistent. There's plenty of impact protection, and the materials make it incredibly lightweight. It's a strong performer overall."
37,163,9.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-01-22,"Compared to many other releases this year, the Jordan 36 is a stand-out shoe. The shoe gives you a lot of push-off power and performance. The only downside is that the comfort doesn't keep up with the excellent performance."
24,163,9.0,RicheeKim,2022-04-15,"The Air Jordan 36 is a great performer. It's fun and bouncy, and I can't get enough of the cushion setup."
34,163,8.5,LZ Hoops,2021-11-03,"Overall, the Jordan 36 is a great shoe for big men and forwards. It provides impact protection, and there really aren't any major issues with the traction."
6,164,7.8,The Sole Brothers,2021-10-04,"The Puma Fusion Nitro is a responsive feeling shoe that provides solid traction. There is a nice amount of court feel. However, the caging of the midsole cushion takes away from the impact protection."
1,164,7.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2021-09-25,"The Puma Fusion Nitro is a letdown compared to the Clyde All-Pros. The traction and cushion are great, but they don't work well with the rest of the shoe."
38,165,9.1,SnB PH,2022-01-22,The Adidas Trae Young 1 might be the best shoe available in its price range. I consider this pair to be the best Adidas shoe for 2021.
35,165,8.2,Shoeware,2022-01-22,"The Trae Young 1 offers extremely nice cushioning. The traction plays a little worse than expected, and the support isn't ideal with only two lacing holes, but it's still a solid performer with some premium touches for materials."
37,165,8.2,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-03-06,The Adidas Trae Young 1 is excellent for players that like to stay low to the ground and play fast in confined spaces. Just make sure to break them in beforehand.
29,165,8.0,MARKCHES,2021-09-29,"The Adidas Trae Young 1 is a stable sneaker. It feels low to the ground, which works well with the Lightstrike cushion in the forefoot. Just make sure to get the right size."
6,165,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2021-10-23,"Overall, the Adidas Trae Young 1 feels great on foot. When playing on clean courts, the shoe feels low to the ground, responsive, and comfortable."
24,165,7.8,RicheeKim,2021-09-30,"The Adidas Trae Young 1 is awesome in every way but the traction. I really like the materials, the fit and support are good, and the cushion shined."
32,165,7.8,ShadeSnSoleS [Youtube],2022-02-22,"For the Adidas Trae Young 1, the traction works, the cushion offers impact protection and court feel, and the upper feels good for the most part."
24,166,8.4,RicheeKim,2021-08-21,"For the price, the Under Armour Flow FUTR X is a solid shoe. If you don't need a lot of impact protection, this shoe will be perfect for you. It has amazing traction, the fit is solid, and it's plenty supportive."
37,166,8.4,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-01-22,The Under Armour Flow FUTR X is great for indoor courts and provides an above-average energy return while remaining lightweight and stable.
6,166,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2021-08-24,"The traction is top tier, the cushion is responsive, and the support was good. Despite the materials, the Under Armour Flow FUTR X is a definite cop."
27,167,9.0,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2021-09-02,"The Adidas Exhibit A is a refreshing entry into the Adidas basketball lineup. It's lightweight with great traction and materials. The cushion is comfortable and playable but could be better. Overall, the shoe is a reliable performer."
24,167,8.4,RicheeKim,2021-09-02,"The Adidas Exhibit A is a solid performer for the price. It has a great cushion if you want to feel quick and shifty. The traction is reliable, and the support has everything need in a hoop shoe."
6,167,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2021-09-13,"The Adidas Exhibit A is good but is just below the top-tier. The traction gets the job done, the cushion is responsive, and the materials perform well for the quality."
32,167,7.6,ShadeSnSoleS [Youtube],2022-02-28,"The Adidas Exhibit A is a shoe that offers an excellent cushioning setup, but the mediocre traction is a letdown."
24,168,8.2,RicheeKim,2021-09-13,"For $100, this is a fantastic option. It is one of the best D Rose shoes to come out in recent years. It plays quickly and offers plenty of court feel though the impact protection could be better. But for the price, it's hard to beat the Adidas D Rose Son of Chi."
6,168,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2021-09-23,"Overall, the Adidas D Rose Son of Chi has good traction and feels responsive. The support is good as well. It just isn't the most minimal feeling shoe in terms of materials."
35,168,7.8,Shoeware,2022-01-22,"The D Rose Son of Chi has nice traction, but the cushion isn't anything special. The support plays well enough, but you can tell the materials aren't the best."
38,169,8.3,SnB PH,2022-01-22,"Donovan Mitchell's latest shoe is a step up from last year's model, but the Adidas DON Issue #3 doesn't live up to the original. It has solid traction and adequate cushioning that will suit guard play."
29,169,8.0,MARKCHES,2021-07-20,"Overall, the D.O.N Issue #3 is a steady basketball shoe. It has dependable traction with a wide base. The cushion and support were also dependable for me."
7,169,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2021-07-20,"The Adidas D.O.N Issue #3 has great traction and comfortable materials. It felt comfortable on foot, but the cushion doesn't hold up after playing more than three games at a time. The heel slippage also takes away from the shoe a bit. Overall, it is a responsive shoe that feels light on your feet."
24,169,8.0,RicheeKim,2021-07-25,"As long as you consistently wipe, you're getting a good-performing shoe. The shoe feels light, the traction performs well enough, and the materials feel nice. The only issue to consider is that there is the potential for heel slippage."
6,169,7.6,The Sole Brothers,2021-08-05,"The D.O.N Issue #3 is a lightweight shoe that provided a decent amount of court feel with the Lightstrike midsole. However, the traction, fit, and heel lockdown left a lot to be desired."
7,170,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2021-08-10,"The Nike Zoom Freak 3 provides a good amount of tech at an affordable price point. They're an upgrade both performance-wise and aesthetics-wise compared to previous models. The cushion feels great, the materials get the job done, and the traction performs well after breaking it in. These are definitely a shoe going into my rotation."
38,170,8.4,SnB PH,2022-01-22,"In my opinion, the Nike Zoom Freak 3 makes major improvements compared to the Zoom Freak 2. The traction is close to being a top-tier performer, and the cushion is nice and bouncy. I'd definitely recommend it."
29,170,8.2,MARKCHES,2021-07-20,"The Nike Zoom Freak 3 is one of my favourite shoes to hoop in right now. The cushion is bouncy, the traction is one of my favourites on the market right now, and in my opinion, they look pretty darn good."
35,170,8.2,Shoeware,2022-01-22,"The Zoom Freak 3 is good, not great. The traction is inconsistent. There is good breathability for your foot and good support."
24,170,7.8,RicheeKim,2021-08-10,"The Zoom Freak 3 is a solid shoe at its current price point. The traction was inconsistent, but the materials, fit, and support make up for it. Overall, Nike did a good job of upgrading the shoe from the Zoom Freak 2."
6,170,7.6,The Sole Brothers,2021-08-05,"The Nike Zoom Freak 3 is a lightweight and minimal shoe. The traction was inconsistent for me, and I was disappointed in the cushion. However, I did like the materials, and the shoe has a great fit."
34,170,7.5,LZ Hoops,2021-11-03,"Overall, the Nike Zoom Freak 3 is a decent shoe if you have a similar playstyle to the Freak himself. The traction performs well, but the support of the shoe was a letdown."
29,171,8.4,MARKCHES,2021-08-01,"The Nike Air Zoom G.T. Run isn't too impressive straight out of the box, but after breaking them in, they slowly become better. There is plenty of cushioning, and the traction becomes solid."
24,171,8.2,RicheeKim,2021-08-06,"Overall, the Nike Air Zoom G.T. Run is a really nice shoe. The only gripes I have are the less-than-premium materials and the traction when on dirtier courts. Other than that, you get tonnes of cushion, the support and lockdown are good, and the fit is solid."
6,171,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2021-08-15,"If you're looking for a crazy cushioning setup, the Nike Air Zoom G.T. Run is the shoe for you. It's a solid shoe for anyone who doesn't mind giving up some court feel and responsiveness to get more impact protection and bounciness."
37,171,8.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-01-22,The Nike Air Zoom GT Run is a solid shoe for those that are looking for an explosive setup and rely on a lot of jumping in their game.
36,171,8.0,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-02-22,"The Nike Zoom GT Run offers solid traction while it lasts and plenty of impact protection. It could be more premium, but it performs well enough."
35,171,7.8,Shoeware,2022-01-22,"The G.T. Run is the worst performer of the 3 Greater Than models. The shoe has good cushioning and traction. However, the support isn't easy to trust with how thin the materials are."
30,172,8.0,Gavriel Rupert Dela Cruz [weartesters.com],2021-07-30,The Nike Giannis Immortality is one of the best signature athlete budget models available. It performs just as well as some signature models despite lacking the same tech that they feature. Definitely a great bang for your buck type of shoe.
6,172,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2021-07-30,"When you're playing in the Giannis Immortality, you feel very light and really quick. The traction is amazing, and the cushion is responsive. Support could've been a bit better, but it wasn't a deal-breaker. I really like this shoe."
24,172,7.6,RicheeKim,2021-07-30,"The Nike Giannis Immortality is a pretty decent budget model. However, there are other shoes at the price point that do outperform the shoe. The cushion and materials feel nice, but I did have issues with support."
35,172,7.6,Shoeware,2022-01-22,The Giannis Immortality is a solid performer in the subline of Giannis's Zoom Freak line with Nike. These also provide lateral containment and consistent traction while also feeling light.
27,173,8.6,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2021-08-10,"Although I was disappointed in the cushion, the Nike Kyrie Low 4 still provides a smooth, lightweight experience. The traction, fit, and support combine to make this shoe a decent performer at a reasonable price."
6,173,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2021-07-01,"The Nike Kyrie Low 4 is a pretty low to the ground, responsive setup, but doesn't provide much bounce or compression. It plays very fast and the shoe itself is very lightweight thanks to the thin materials. It's still a shoe I really liked playing in despite being a bit disappointed in the cushion."
24,173,8.0,RicheeKim,2021-08-01,"The Nike Kyrie Low 4 is an overall good performer. One thing to note is that the shoe isn't the best for impact protection, but it does offer a lot of responsiveness, and the support is great."
6,174,8.5,The Sole Brothers,2021-07-01,"The Curry 3Z5 is an amazing shoe for only $80. The traction is phenomenal. The Micro G feels soft and responsive like the Micro G of old, and the fit was perfect. The only downside is that the heel area was a bit uncomfortable when I was breaking it in. Overall, the shoe felt amazing."
24,174,8.2,RicheeKim,2021-09-02,"At a retail price of $80, the Curry 3Z5 is a solid shoe. I have no complaints outside of the dust pickup on dirtier courts, but that's just nitpicking since it still performed nicely."
36,175,9.2,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-01-22,"The Nike Air Zoom GT Cut is my favourite Nike basketball shoe this year. It offers a Kobe-like setup that's lightweight with fantastic cushioning. The traction holds up, and the shoe is comfortable right out of the box."
34,175,9.2,LZ Hoops,2021-11-03,"The Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut is a perfect indoor basketball shoe. They are the definite best shoe to release in 2021 for shifty and quick players who emphasize lockdown, cushion, and traction."
1,175,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2021-06-21,"If you love the Kobe 8, you'll love these. The shoe does an excellent job of providing a low-profile, lightweight setup that still provides a decent amount of cushioning. However, I would recommend playing indoors to get the most out of the traction."
35,175,9.0,Shoeware,2022-01-26,"The Nike Air Zoom GT Cut is as close to a Kobe as it gets. The cushion is one of the best on the market, and the traction performed well. These kill it on the court."
29,175,8.8,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"For people that like low-profile sneakers, this is a must-have in your collection. The cushion is an amazing combination of responsiveness and bounce, and the traction performs very well. The only thing to watch out for is that the shoe does fit snug."
6,175,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2021-05-21,"This a top-tier performer. The cushion is phenomenal and the traction performs really nice as long as you wipe to keep dust from building up. It can get a little tight in the forefoot area, but not enough to take away from the performance."
35,175,8.6,Shoeware,2022-01-22,"This review is for outdoor performance. The Nike Air Zoom GT Cut is easily worth the money. I don't use the word often, but these are fantastic. The traction holds up well, and the cushion is one of the best available."
24,175,8.4,RicheeKim,2021-06-02,"The cushion in this shoe is one of the best setups for fast and shifty players. It's a great performer but is a bit expensive coming in at $170 retail. However, I feel the performance makes the shoe worth it."
9,176,8.5,KickGenius,2021-06-14,"The shoe very much feels like a budget model. There are certain aspects of the shoe that could have been done much better, but the mid-tier tech is what was put in the shoe instead."
33,176,8.3,Soled Out Reviews,2022-07-01,"The Jordan Zion 1 is one of my favourite shoes. The cushioning is comfortable, and the lockdown and stability are solid."
7,176,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2021-05-10,"Every aspect of this shoe is solid. There is nothing amazing about this shoe, but there's nothing bad about it either. For $120 you get a solid first signature shoe that works for all types of players."
6,176,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2021-05-18,"If you want a comfortable shoe that provides a lot of bounce and protection, this is a great shoe to pick up. On the flip side, because the cushion is very bouncy, the shoe does feel a bit slow. Couple that with the traction not being the most consistent, this shoe may not be the best fit for everyone."
35,176,8.0,Shoeware,2022-01-22,The Jordan Zion 1 is a good place to start Zion's signature shoe line. This is a well-balanced performer.
36,176,7.9,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-03-28,"Overall, if you like a firmer cushion setup, I think you'll enjoy the Jordan Zion 1. The shoe is super supportive, and the rubber is solid enough that it could be a decent outdoor pair."
24,176,7.8,RicheeKim,2021-05-13,The Zion 1 is a solid first signature shoe and was fun to play in. I just wish that they had used more premium materials.
25,176,7.8,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2021-07-01,"The Jordan Zion 1 provides a smooth ride that leads you into the extra bottom-loaded Zoom unit in the forefoot for some extra nice pop. However, its shortcomings are a bit too much to overcome. The fit is not versatile enough to accommodate more types of foot shapes and I experienced quite a bit of slipping with the traction and in the heel area of the shoe."
24,177,8.0,RicheeKim,2021-05-10,"For $90 retail this is a solid pickup. The firm cushioning feels like a downgrade to me, everything else is an upgrade from previous KD Trey 5 models."
6,177,7.8,The Sole Brothers,2021-05-10,"The KD Trey 5 IX is a solid performer. This shoe might be for you if you are looking for a lightweight, minimal, and affordable shoe."
6,178,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2021-04-08,"The Adidas N3XT L3V3L is a good performer and I enjoyed playing in them. They are pretty expensive at $180 though, and they didn't perform well enough to crack my rotation. They also aren't the best for guards because they're pretty bottom-heavy."
37,178,8.5,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-01-22,The Adidas N3XT L3V3L Futurenatural is a tremendous step forward for laceless performance shoes. The only obvious downside that I experienced was the weight of the shoe.
24,178,8.4,RicheeKim,2021-04-08,"If you've ever tried the N3XT L3V3L line you know what to expect performance-wise with these. For $180, I probably wouldn't recommend them because of the price and the stiff cushion setup."
35,178,8.0,Shoeware,2022-01-22,"The Adidas N3XT L3V3L Futurenatural almost feels like the laceless version of the Harden Vol. 5, but with slightly better materials and a laceless upper."
1,179,9.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2021-06-21,"The Nike KD 14 is one of the best shoes of 2021 so far. The cushion feels like a springy marshmallow, the traction was fantastic, the support and lockdown were great. The shoe does everything well from a performance basketball perspective."
7,179,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2021-05-04,"Every aspect of the KD14 performs really well and I like it better than the KD13. The cushion feels awesome and the traction and fit work well after a short break-in period. Also, the $150 price is fair considering all the tech you are getting."
6,179,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2021-05-10,"The KD 14 might be my #1 favorite shoe to play in right now! Awesome traction, minimal materials, and responsiveness without compromising impact protection - I absolutely love playing in them!"
37,179,9.0,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-01-22,"The Nike KD 14 provides excellent grip, stability, and cushion - especially when moving from side to side. It also does this without compromising much at all performance-wise."
36,179,8.9,Snkr Tech Talk,2022-02-01,I definitely recommend the Nike KD 14. They have one of the best tractions out right now and a fantastic cushion. The support is also solid with the cheap-feeling materials being the only con.
35,179,8.8,Shoeware,2022-01-22,"Overall, the Nike KD 14 is another step forward in Kevin Durant's shoe line. They're light on foot, breathable, and the traction is great."
24,179,8.6,RicheeKim,2021-05-04,"The KD 14 is very comfortable, a lot of fun to play in, and just a great shoe overall."
9,179,8.4,KickGenius,2021-06-14,"The KD 14 is one of the most versatile shoes out right now. It has the best technology that Nike has to offer, making it so that everyone can play in the shoe regardless of position. I feel like the KD 14 has something to offer for everyone and it's one of my favorite shoes to play in right now."
24,180,8.4,RicheeKim,2021-04-21,"For $70 retail, this is a banger of a shoe. If you are looking for impact protection, this shoe isn't for you. But everything else is really nice. The Nike Precision 5 is a great to shoe to play in and I honestly can't believe that it's only $70."
6,180,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2021-04-30,"If the Precision 5 was $120, I'd still recommend it because it performs extremely well. The only thing that's lacking is the cushion - and it's not that bad."
32,180,7.5,ShadeSnSoleS [Youtube],2022-03-05,"Overall, the Nike Precision 5 has solid traction and a decent cushion. The materials also weren't bad for a budget shoe, but the fit is wonky."
32,181,8.8,ShadeSnSoleS [Youtube],2022-03-11,Guards that are looking for court feel and traction will enjoy this shoe. I highly recommend playing in the Puma Court Rider.
6,181,7.5,The Sole Brothers,2021-06-22,"Overall, it is a comfortable and cozy feeling shoe, but it wasn't very responsive because the traction didn't perform well. The cushion is also pretty minimal, but that's understandable for a budget shoe like the Court Rider. I didn't really like playing in this shoe considering there are plenty of good options in the budget shoe price range."
24,182,9.0,RicheeKim,2021-03-12,The Under Armour Spawn 3 retails for just $100 and for the price it's a banger! A very very good performer - I have nothing bad to say about these.
6,182,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2021-03-12,Go get a pair! The Under Armour Spawn 3 is freaking phenomenal. My only minor issues are the heel curve and the durability of the outsole for outdoor use.
1,183,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2021-03-21,"Overall, I have loved playing in the Nike Cosmic Unity. They provide the stability and cushion I want and love. There's nothing I can complain about!"
24,183,8.8,RicheeKim,2021-03-21,The Nike Cosmic Unity retails for $150 and is a really solid shoe for the price. The only thing I didn't like in these was the traction on dust. I'm hoping the other colorways have better traction.
6,183,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2021-03-26,"The Cosmic Unity is super nice! Similar to the KD 13, but better quality and a little bulkier. I feel like any position or type of player would enjoy playing in these. These will be in my rotation and I really liked playing in them."
29,183,8.6,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"The Nike Cosmic Unity is a great shoe. The cushion felt very good after breaking them in, and the materials feel premium. My only complaint about the shoe is the extra weight coming from the protruding heel cup."
30,184,8.6,Gavriel Rupert Dela Cruz [weartesters.com],2021-06-21,"Whether you�re a LeBron fan, a person who likes impact protection, or a newbie looking for a shoe that�ll get you started, I can definitely recommend these."
24,184,8.4,RicheeKim,2021-03-26,"The LeBron 18 Low retails for $160 and they are a pretty good performer. The materials could've been a bit better, but from a performance standpoint, they are really good."
6,184,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2021-03-26,"The LeBron 18 Low performs pretty well and I enjoyed playing in it. They will be in my rotation pretty loosely because I prefer other cushion setups, but overall these are solid."
18,185,9.0,AnotherPair [Youtube],2021-04-23,Overall the New Balance Two Wxy is a great all-around performer that any type of player can play in!
6,185,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2021-04-23,Overall the New Balance TWO WXY is very minimal and lightweight on foot and performs very well. Most types of players and play styles should be able to play in these. I'd 100% recommend getting them.
7,186,9.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2021-02-13,"For $110, the PG 5 has a good amount of tech, really nice cushioning, and performs well in all aspects. There is some room for improvement when it comes to the quality of the materials."
24,186,8.8,RicheeKim,2021-02-13,"The PG 5 is a very solid performer. I wish the materials were a bit nicer, but at a $110 price point, I can't complain!"
6,186,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2021-02-13,"The PG 5 is a very solid performer. They are lightweight and I never had to worry when I played in them. Overall, there weren't many bad things I could say about these."
1,186,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2021-05-26,The PG5 is very good in most areas with the only downside being that the cushion didn't really perform well outdoors. They should be very good if you are playing indoors.
19,186,8.6,PureKicks,2021-09-13,The Nike PG5s cushion and traction are incredible. The materials perform nicely on the court as well. The shoe has just about everything you need from your hoop shoe.
29,186,8.2,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"Overall, the shoe has durable materials, is very supportive, and the cushion provides very nice impact protection. The traction actually grips very hard and is very stable to play in."
40,187,8.8,RunStretchTech,2022-06-14,"Li-Ning's Way of Wade 9 Infinity is a pricey shoe, but it provides plenty of performance and durability for the price."
37,187,8.4,Foot Doctor Zach,2022-04-19,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade 9 performs well for players looking for front-to-back speed, but they aren't the best for those that like to feel low to the ground."
6,187,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2022-02-18,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade 9 Infinity is a solid all-around shoe. The traction bites, the cushion is alright, and the support is there too."
6,188,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2022-02-18,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade 9 offers premium features and materials. It could be lighter, and the cushion could be a bit more responsive, but I have no complaints other than that."
3,189,7.6,Schwollo,2021-02-01,"The Harden Volume 5 uses ""new tech"" for the sake of using ""new tech"". At $130 these aren't super expensive, but they don't do anything better than their predecessors and that is generous. I don't recommend these."
6,189,7.0,The Sole Brothers,2021-02-03,"I really wanted to like the Harden Volume 5, but I'm super disappointed with the performance of these. I'll probably never ball in them again, and I don't recommend them."
24,189,6.6,RicheeKim,2021-01-23,"The Harden Vol. 5 retails for $130 and considering the problems I had, these are a no go. I highly recommend staying away from this shoe unless you are a big Harden fan."
7,189,6.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-12-25,The Harden Vol. 5 comes in at $130 which isn't bad for a signature shoe but is too much considering the performance of these. Unless you're a diehard Harden fan I can't see anyone hooping in these.
36,190,9.4,Snkr Tech Talk,2024-06-02,"The Nike Kobe 6 Protro is an outstanding performer. It takes a few hours to break in, but I love the traction, cushioning, and fit."
47,190,9.0,Lukas Simoner,2024-04-21,"The Nike Kobe 6 Protro is my go-to shoe for games. I love the traction performance, and the cushioning moulds to my foot."
24,190,8.6,RicheeKim,2021-01-13,"The Kobe 6 Protro is a great performer and I really enjoyed every single aspect of the shoe. The traction is amazing and the cushion feels nice and smooth. It's a good blend of court feel, responsiveness, and impact protection. I don't regret getting these at all."
29,190,8.4,MARKCHES,2021-05-16,"I really liked playing in the Kobe 6 Protro. It is a low-profile shoe that has the right balance of responsiveness, bounciness, and impact protection. The only downside is that it's hard to get your hands on a pair."
24,191,8.4,RicheeKim,2021-01-23,The Harden Stepback 2 retails for $80 and I would definitely recommend it. You get solid all-around basketball shoes that perform better than the much more expensive Harden Vol. 5.
6,191,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2021-01-23,"For only $80 retail, the Harden Stepback 2 is a great performer. They are a little bottom heavy and I had some heel slippage issues, but other than that, I really like this shoe!"
6,192,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2021-01-23,The Why Not Zero.4 is a solid performer. I especially liked the double-stacked Zoom units!
24,192,8.4,RicheeKim,2021-02-03,"For $130, I wouldn't recommend the Why Not Zero.4 just because of the inconsistent traction. It was just enough to cause me to not enjoy playing in the shoe. If you are a very linear player who doesn't make a lot of lateral movements you can probably get away with these."
19,192,8.0,PureKicks,2021-09-29,"The Jordan Why Not Zero.4 does the job done, and it does it well. The materials and cushion excel, but the lack of a consistent laced-up fit leads to inconsistent support. If you can lace it up properly, the performance shouldn't be an issue."
32,193,8.0,ShadeSnSoleS [Youtube],2021-08-21,"The Jordan One Take 2 is a good shoe for the price. The cushion could be a bit lower to the ground, and the materials could be of better quality. But, they perform well enough at the $100 price tag."
6,193,6.8,The Sole Brothers,2021-03-21,"Overall, the Jordan One Take 2 is a downgrade from the previous One Take. If you make a lot of lateral cuts, this isn't the traction for you. The materials feel cheaper than the previous model, and the cushion isn't as good either. It's definitely a disappointing follow-up to the great budget option that the Jordan Westbrook One Take was."
27,194,9.1,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2021-03-28,"The forefoot cushioning makes this a great shoe for guards, but allows it to be versatile enough for bigs that like to use their quickness. If price isn't an issue, it's a really good shoe."
7,195,9.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-12-18,"At $160, you are getting a phenomenal hoop shoe. Pretty much every aspect of the shoe is really good. If I had to describe the Curry 8 in one word it would be fluid."
1,195,9.1,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2021-05-26,I absolutely love the Curry 8. The traction is amazing and will work outdoors. It also features great cushioning with the new Flow technology. There are 2 main differences between the 8 and previous Curry shoes. The first is that the upper is much lighter on the 8 and the second is that the 8 gives you both cushioning and court feel.
24,195,9.0,RicheeKim,2020-12-20,The Curry 8 is $20 more expensive than the Curry 7 and it's totally worth it! The traction and the cushion are highlights of the shoe. If you pick up a pair of these I don't think you'll be disappointed.
6,195,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2020-12-31,The Curry 8 is awesome. The traction is insane and the cushion is super nice. If you are a guard you will definitely like playing in these!
3,195,8.2,Schwollo,2021-01-13,"The Curry 8 was very close to being great. It was supposed to feel like a running shoe and it definitely did, but to a fault. I loved the traction and the shoe, but it fell short in too many categories to justify $160."
24,196,8.6,RicheeKim,2020-12-18,"Personally, I like the D Rose 11 better than the 10. For $120 I don't think you'll be disappointed with these. Just watch out for the break-in period with the traction."
6,196,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2020-12-18,I'm not a huge fan of the D Rose 11 (or any D Rose since the 7). If you have wide feet and like a roomier fit then you will probably enjoy these more than I did. The cushion and traction are nice though.
27,197,9.2,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2020-12-31,"The Nike Zoom Rize 2 is my personal favorite shoe to play in right now. It has all the necessary features to be enjoyed by bigger post players like Marc Gasol or Nikola Jokic while also appealing to faster, downhill-type guards like Russell Westbrook."
29,197,8.7,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"If you like minimal, lightweight, low-cut basketball shoes with a traditional look and lacing system, then the Nike Rize 2 is a great pick."
1,198,9.3,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2021-02-01,I've been calling the Puma Clyde All-Pro the Kobe 9 reincarnate since the first time I played in them. The Kobe 9 was one of the best basketball shoes of all time and the Puma Clyde All-Pro is a better version of it!
6,198,9.2,The Sole Brothers,2021-02-01,The Puma Clyde All-Pro was one of my favorites shoes I've tested this year and it is only $130. Plus I feel like every type of player would enjoy hooping in these. I 100% recommend these.
24,198,9.2,RicheeKim,2021-03-10,The Puma Clyde All-Pro is a beastly performer and very well balanced!
29,198,8.6,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"Overall, I really like the All-Pro. The cushion and the upper are very good upgrades from the Hardwood. It's bouncy, responsive, and has plenty of impact protection. It's very stable and provides more than enough support. I'm really impressed with the Puma All-Pro."
6,199,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2022-02-19,The Li-Ning Way of Wade All City 9 is a shoe that's definitely going in my rotation. I love this shoe. It can accommodate every position and playstyle.
29,199,8.3,MARKCHES,2022-02-19,"The Li-Ning Way of Wade All City 9 is a solid all-around sneaker. It has traction and cushion, and it's a fast shoe."
7,200,9.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-11-17,"The Kyrie 7 is the best hoop shoe in his line to date. Performance-wise, these do it all!"
6,200,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2020-12-04,I really like the Kyrie 7. They feel like an upgraded version of the Kyrie 6 with just okay traction. A very good performer overall!
24,200,8.6,RicheeKim,2020-11-23,"You are getting a very solid performer for $130. My only gripe with the shoe was the traction on dust, but overall the Kyrie 7 is a great hoop shoe."
9,200,8.0,KickGenius,2021-06-14,"The Kyrie is a very dependable sneaker. There really isn't much that it truly excels at and there are better options. It is one of the most consistent lines Nike has to offer. Overall, the shoe is going to do what you want and need it to do."
19,200,8.0,PureKicks,2021-08-10,"Like previous iterations, the Nike Kyrie 7 is a great performing shoe. Its traction is consistent, the cushion is responsive, and the fit and materials help to provide a good support system."
6,201,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2020-11-23,The Lebron Witness 5 is a really nice shoe to play in even for a budget shoe at $100. I would definitely recommend these.
24,201,8.6,RicheeKim,2020-11-17,"For $100, the Lebron Witness 5 is a pretty solid shoe - I would definitely recommend them!"
27,202,9.1,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2021-02-01,I'd recommend the Kawhi 1 to everyone who is okay with a little bit of break-in time. They will be good for any playing style and especially cater to bigger athletes looking for more support.
6,202,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2020-11-25,"I didn't like playing in the Kawhi, especially for $160. If you need a rigid and supportive shoe then these are for you, but if not I'd stay away from these."
24,202,8.2,RicheeKim,2020-11-19,"The Kawhi retails for $160 and is a great performer. For the price I expected a little more, but overall these are nice."
29,202,8.2,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"The New Balance Kawhi 1 is a good first entry in Kawhi's signature line. It's a supportive and secure shoe with a decent cushion that provides impact protection. The traction also grips nicely, and the compound appears to be durable."
24,203,7.8,RicheeKim,2020-11-19,"Personally, I wouldn't play in the Kyrie Flytrap 4 because of the stiff cushion, but if you want a pair of shoes to beat up these aren't bad for $90."
6,203,7.6,The Sole Brothers,2020-11-19,I'd recommend not getting the Kyrie Flytrap 4. I'd suggest the Flytrap 3 instead just because of the traction and cushion.
6,204,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2020-11-02,"This is my favorite LeBron to play in! The only drawbacks are the weight, lateral stability, and court feel. Everything else performed well and I enjoyed playing in it. I'd 100% recommend these."
1,204,8.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-12-18,The Lebron 18 is a bad boy with an amazing cushion and solid traction. The lateral instability was the only thing holding them back from being an all-out beast.
19,204,8.2,PureKicks,2021-05-31,"The LeBron 18 provides plenty of cushioning but is a heavy shoe because of it. Despite this, it's a good shoe that can fit a variety of play styles if you can handle the support and lack of court feel."
7,204,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-10-09,The LeBron 18 is definitely a big boy shoe. The cushion is by far the best aspect of the shoe and the traction is solid too. The digging of the tongue into my foot and lateral stability were issues though.
24,204,8.0,RicheeKim,2020-10-24,"Overall for $200 I wouldn't recommend the LeBron 18. The tongue was pretty uncomfortable, the traction wasn't great, and the lateral containment was an issue. Pick these up if you want a crazy cushion setup."
9,204,7.6,KickGenius,2021-06-14,"I would not recommend this shoe to just about anyone. I'd only say get these if you need the extra cushion underfoot and are in dire need of impact protection. It really depends on your play style. Based on my personal preference, however, I didn't like the lack of court feel and responsiveness of the LeBron."
6,205,9.4,The Sole Brothers,2020-10-19,"The Jordan 35 comes in at $180 which is definitely expensive, but if you want a great performer these are it. This shoe excels in all areas and I think everyone can play in it."
1,205,9.1,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-10-17,"The Jordan 35 is an updated version of the 34 and excels in almost every category. Unfortunately, the fit issue with the nylon cables ruined my ability to be comfortable in the shoe."
7,205,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-10-25,"Overall, the Jordan 35 performs really well. It has better cushion and materials than the 34, but I didn't like the eclipse plate as much because it was uncomfortable at times."
24,205,9.0,RicheeKim,2020-11-01,"The Jordan 35 retails for $180 which is pretty steep, but this is a really nice shoe that performs well. Everything about the shoe is amazing besides the traction on dust. Overall, it was extremely fun to play in the AJ XXXV."
29,205,8.3,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"The strong points for the sneaker are that the forefoot Zoom unit keeps you close to the ground while staying bouncy, and the upper materials are comfortable and do a good job of keeping you contained. That being said, there are some inconsistencies with the traction, and the insole takes a little bit of breaking in. Overall, the Jordan 35 is an improvement from the 34."
24,206,8.8,RicheeKim,2020-10-21,For $110 the Dame 7 is definitely a recommended pickup. I don't think you'll be disappointed!
6,206,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2020-10-31,I really enjoyed playing in these! Everything performed well and I think every position player can play in these.
24,207,8.4,RicheeKim,2020-09-13,The Kyrie Low 3 retails for $110 and I think you get a pretty solid performer for the price. The only issues I had with these were the narrowness because of my slightly wide feet and the lack of impact protection.
6,207,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2021-03-10,"Overall the Kyrie Low 3 is very similar to the Kyrie Low 2, but slightly improved. I liked the materials better and they were more comfortable."
1,208,8.7,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-10-06,"The RS Dreamer is one of the best looking hoop shoes of 2020. If PUMA can improve their cushion setup then they will be a serious contender to Nike, Jordan, and Adidas. You will be satisfied if you pick up the RS Dreamer!"
24,208,8.2,RicheeKim,2020-09-15,"For $120, I'd say go get a pair of the RS Dreamer because these are really fun to play in. Overall these are a solid pair of shoes if you like feeling light on your feet."
6,208,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2020-09-15,The RS Dreamer is a solid all-around shoe. The great traction and support make for a shoe that almost anyone can play in. My only issues were that they are pretty heavy and the cushion setup isn't great.
24,209,8.4,RicheeKim,2020-09-22,Overall the LeBron Soldier 14 is a very solid performer for $140 and a lot of fun to play in.
6,209,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2020-09-22,"The Lebron Soldier 14 wasn't my favorite shoe to ball in because of the traction and the stiff heel cushioning. Not the best fit for guards, but if you're a big dude then I think these would be pretty nice."
29,209,8.2,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"The Nike LeBron Soldier 14 is a solid performing shoe. Despite not being a mainline LeBron signature, Nike didn't cut any corners on the cushion in this model. The traction is also what you'd come to expect from the Soldier line. It's grippy and durable. Overall, I really enjoyed playing in this shoe."
1,210,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-09-30,"Overall, I think Under Armour did very well with the Embiid 1. The traction and the cushion were high points of the shoe and everything else is solid all-around. Any player and position can wear these and they're good for outdoor use too."
6,210,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2020-10-02,I really enjoyed playing in the Embiid 1! It's a really supportive and responsive shoe that you never have to worry about. Solid all around and will be loosely in my rotation.
7,210,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-10-24,The Embiid 1 is a solid shoe especially for the price of $120. Every aspect of these performed pretty well and they were ready to go out of the box. Any position or player can play in these.
29,210,8.0,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"The use of Micro G and HOVR provided a great cushioning setup that provided plenty of impact protection while still being bouncy. The traction played well after breaking in, and the materials feel nice when playing. Although, I do wish they were a bit more premium. Overall, the Embiid 1 is built well for performance basketball."
24,210,7.8,RicheeKim,2020-10-04,"The Embiid 1 retailed for $120, but I can't recommend them because of the traction issues I had. If you play on really clean courts then you should be fine, but otherwise, you'll probably have issues."
7,211,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-10-17,"The Kybrid S2 is a well-performing hoop shoe. I liked the combination of the Kyrie 4, 5, and 6! The cushion and the traction could have been a little better though."
24,211,8.4,RicheeKim,2020-10-17,The Kyrie Kybrid S2 is a great performing shoe besides the traction. I wish they used the traction and cushion setups from the Kyrie 5 or 6 because I think those were better. I would recommend these if you play on mostly clean courts.
7,212,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-08-02,"The D.O.N. Issue #2 definitely has some improvements over the #1, but some aspects were worse such as the traction. You're getting solid lockdown and support with these and a responsive cushioning setup. For the price of $100, you're getting a pretty good performance hoop shoe."
1,212,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-11-06,The Adidas D.O.N. Issue 2 is a surprise hit indoors for me. They are a great bang for your buck shoe at only $100!
24,212,8.0,RicheeKim,2020-09-14,"I had fun playing in these while I could tolerate the pain in the forefoot, but eventually I just had to switch shoes. These were solid for the price and are a good pickup if you don't have the same fit issue as me."
6,212,7.6,The Sole Brothers,2020-08-29,"It is kind of hard for me to recommend the D.O.N. Issue #2 as I didn't really enjoy playing in these. The cushioning was good, materials were a little too thick, and they are pretty heavy. If you don't mind bigger and bulkier shoes and want something that is really supportive with pretty nice cushioning than you should give these a try. They definitely weren't for me though."
7,213,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-08-04,"For $120, the Zoom Freak 2s is an affordable signature sneaker that offers a good amount of tech. It doesn't really have a weak point and should be good for all types of hoopers whether you are a guard or a big man. Definitely an upgrade over the Zoom Freak 1s!"
6,213,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2020-08-21,The Nike Zoom Freak 2 feels extremely light and minimal on foot and I really like it. It is one of those shoes you can put on and just focus on playing ball regardless of position. It isn't clunky or heavy on foot and just feels smooth. The only downside was that there isn't a lot of impact protection provided from this cushion setup. This shoe performs really well for the price!
29,213,8.2,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"Nike really listened and made positive changes in the Zoom Freak 2. The support is better and your foot feels secure and locked in. The cushion is improved with the forefoot Zoom unit, and the traction grips well on most court conditions."
24,213,8.0,RicheeKim,2020-08-07,"For $120, I think you're getting a fantastic shoe with the Nike Zoom Freak 2. It's a perfect shoe for guards because you'll feel quick and responsive on your feet. If you are looking for a lot of impact protection this isn't the shoe for you. If you want to pick up a pair, I think you won't be disappointed!"
25,213,7.5,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2020-11-25,The inconsistent traction never allowed me to feel safe in the Nike Zoom Freak 2. There wasn't anything else that was exciting or stood out in this shoe either.
24,214,8.6,RicheeKim,2020-08-07,These retail for $150 which is $30 less than the original Adidas N3XT L3V3L. I think this is a step in the right direction and I you're getting a great performer for the price. This is one of the best implementations of Lightstrike and overall a unique shoe that is worth it.
6,214,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2020-08-19,"Overall I was very surprised with the Adidas N3XT L3V3L 2020. I didn't think I would like them, but I got to playing and I really really like it. Everything was really nice and comfortable, but I did miss laces a bit. I would definitely recommend these and think that any position could play in them."
6,215,8.3,The Sole Brothers,2020-08-17,"For $80, this is a beastly performer. This is the best budget model available right now, even better than the KD Trey 5 VIII."
24,215,7.6,RicheeKim,2020-08-17,"For only $80, I can't complain. The materials feel budget and the Renew cushioning isn't as nice as in the KD Trey 5 VIII. But the fit, traction, and support are good."
11,216,8.8,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2020-11-25,"The Adidas Pro Boost Low is now my go-to hoop shoe for 2020. The traction, cushion, and fit are topped by none. I couldn't think of a bad thing about this shoe."
6,216,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2020-09-07,"Nothing stood out too much on the Adidas Pro Boost Low for me, but it performs like a beast. They were great in every category. If you're looking for a supportive, minimal shoe that you don't have to worry about than these are it. I'd 100% recommend these."
24,216,8.0,RicheeKim,2020-08-17,"At $110, the Adidas Pro Boost Low is definitely a good deal. I didn't expect a firm, responsive cushion setup out of these, but it wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Overall these have you covered if you want to feel light on your feet and quick."
6,217,7.0,The Sole Brothers,2020-09-01,"Don't get it! My feet hurt a lot because of the super minimal cushioning. The traction isn't good, the materials are meh and you can get much better shoes - even at a budget price of $100."
1,217,7.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-09-01,"I didn't get to play in these and I do like the design and the colorways, but for only $10 more you can get the PG4 with a much better cushioning and more premium materials."
24,218,8.8,RicheeKim,2020-09-09,"The Jordan React Elevation was a great pickup for $120. They were very, very fun to play in and I highly recommend them."
6,218,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2020-09-07,These were a solid performer at a very good price. My favorite part was the cushion and overall the Jordan React Elevation performed well in every category. Pretty much every position can play in this shoe.
1,219,8.9,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-08-26,"Overall the Nike Zoom BB NXT is a fun shoe to play in with fantastic traction and cushion! They aren't perfect, but its a good improvement step for Nike and a refreshing change of pace. I do wish they had been able to fix the lateral Zoom Air and lacing cable issues prior to releasing."
6,219,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2020-08-04,"Almost everything about this shoe is awesome: the traction, the heel-to-toe-transition, the materials. But Nike just did too much with the React cushioning - it's super soft and comfortable but I didn't feel secure on lateral cuts because the midsole is so thick and unstable."
24,219,8.4,RicheeKim,2020-08-03,The Nike Air Zoom BB NXT is a very comfortable shoe with interesting new tech. The cushioning is insane and I really liked the traction too. The only downsides are the lacking stability on lateral cuts and the hefty retail price of $180.
7,219,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-07-22,"The Nike Air Zoom BB NXT is an above-average sneaker that is very comfortable and features awesome cushioning and traction. Materials and lockdown are solid but stability is an issue. Overall, a good pick for big hoopers looking for a lot of impact protection, but at a price of $180, there are better and more affordable options on the market."
29,219,8.0,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"The Nike Zoom BB NXT has an amazing cushion setup that feels plush and bouncy. It's a great all-around sneaker to hoop in, and it truly reminds me of the early setups of the Hyperdunk."
24,220,8.4,RicheeKim,2020-07-22,"The Under Armour HOVR Havoc 3 retails for $110 and I think you're getting a pretty solid performer for the price. I wish they had a little nicer materials and more impact protection, but everything else on the shoe was fine."
6,220,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2020-07-31,Overall the HOVR Havoc 3 was a solid performer for $110! It was great in pretty much all categories and didn't have any real low points.
6,221,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2020-06-19,"The performance of the Adidas BYW 2.0 was really good. If you want a comfortable, supportive shoe with a nice cushioning setup and you don't mind the slightly too expensive retail price, then go for it!"
24,221,8.4,RicheeKim,2020-08-02,"For $160, this is not the best shoe in this price range. But if you are a fan of a more responsive Boost cushioning or you can find this shoe on a discount - I would highly recommend it. This is a great performer and one of the best team models Adidas has put on the market in a while."
29,221,8.2,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,I really like how the BYW 2.0 plays. It's low to the ground and still has impact protection because of the Boost. It's also well-ventilated and very stable.
29,222,8.3,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"The Jordan One Take is a good option for anyone not looking to spend money on a signature shoe. It has solid, responsive cushioning, and the traction performed very well, even on dusty courts."
6,222,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2020-06-19,"For $100, the Jordan Westbrook One Take is incredible. If the traction held up better, it'd be amazing. That's my only gripe. The cushion was great for a budget model. I felt fast and responsive. The materials feel nice, and the support is there. There isn't much this shoe is missing."
6,223,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2020-08-02,"The Converse G4 are good performers that I enjoyed playing in. Personally they weren't as fluid or smooth as I would have liked, but I feel like all players can play in this shoe."
24,223,8.2,RicheeKim,2020-08-02,For $120 I would say the Converse G4 is a pretty good shoe. You get a unique shoe that performs well overall and I don't think you'll be disappointed unless you need a lot of impact protection.
7,224,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-04-17,"The performance is off the charts: cushioning is awesome and traction is good too. The materials could have been a little bit more premium and supportive. Overall, the KD 13 is very similar to the KD12 and a phenomenal performance hoop shoe."
24,224,8.8,RicheeKim,2020-07-13,"The KD 13 is a great performer! The materials are just okay, but everything else is really solid."
19,224,8.8,PureKicks,2020-08-10,"We'll say it again... arguably the greatest cushioning setup we've tested at PureKicks! Overall, this is the greatest out of box experience we've ever had. Don't miss out and make sure you cop these!"
29,224,8.8,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,The Nike KD 13 improves on the KD 12 by improving stability and cushioning. It's one of my top shoes for 2020 and really has no flaws.
6,224,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2020-06-04,"I love this shoe! Traction seemed good, cushioning is incredible and the fit was perfect for me"
1,224,8.5,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-07-23,"I really enjoy the Nike KD 13, but they�re not perfect. Cushioning and traction are awesome but containment and stability leave a bit to be desired."
24,225,8.4,RicheeKim,2020-07-22,"For only $90 retail, this is a really nice shoe. The cushion setup is great and traction works really well. Overall, the KD Trey 5 VIII doesn't feel like a budget model at all - I'd highly recommend picking these up if you're interested in them."
6,225,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2020-07-22,"For $90 this has to be one of the best budget shoes I have tried. The KD Trey 5 VII is super light and minimal and you feel very quick playing in these. This shoe doesn't feel cheap and the only downside for me was the support. Overall, a great shoe for the price and should work well for players who want to hoop outdoors."
1,226,8.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-03-07,"Overall, I found that the Nike Adapt BB 2.0 was better than the original Adapt BB, but I still don�t feel that these are necessarily for me."
6,226,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2020-03-03,"Traction, cushioning, support, and fit work well. But the cheap materials, the weight, and the bulkiness made it so that I couldn't enjoy playing in the Adapt BB 2.0."
29,226,8.2,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"The cushion and support are fantastic, but the traction can be inconsistent on dustier courts. Despite this, I still enjoyed playing in the Nike Adapt BB 2.0."
24,226,7.8,RicheeKim,2020-02-27,This shoe is nowhere near worth the $400 price tag.
24,227,8.4,RicheeKim,2020-03-07,$170 is a steep price but I don't think you will be disappointed if you pick up the Lebron 17 Low.
6,227,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2020-03-07,"The traction was really good and the cushioning was pretty damn nice. Overall, the Lebron 17 Low is a solid performer but probably not worth $170, especially considering the cheap upper materials."
29,227,8.4,MARKCHES,2021-05-06,"The Nike LeBron 17 Low is an impressive performing sneaker. The traction is excellent, and the materials do a good job of helping you feel supportive. The cushion is not as plush as the regular LeBron 17, but they do offer more stability."
6,228,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2020-06-19,"I was pleasantly surprised. For $100 retail, the Adidas Pro Model 2G performs really well and is a super solid shoe that will work for most player types!"
3,228,8.2,Schwollo,2020-07-14,"The updated version of the classic Pro Model checks all the boxes compared to modern basketball shoes and gives you good traction, fun cushioning, solid support & stability, and a good fit."
7,229,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-01-03,Everything about this shoe is super solid. If you like the flashy and futuristic design this is a great shoe to pickup!
6,229,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2020-01-03,"The Why Not Zer0.3 is a really good performer. I like it a lot better than the first two models, but I still would have preferred it to be a little lighter and more minimal-feeling."
19,229,8.6,PureKicks,2020-04-01,This is definitely my favorite Westbrook sneaker so far thanks to the amazing Zoom Turbo cushioning and aggressive traction pattern. But the main attraction of the shoe is the deconstructed style that looks amazing!
24,229,8.2,RicheeKim,2020-01-14,"The Why Not Zer0.3 is not a terrible performer overall, but the issues with lateral traction are a dealbreaker for me."
15,229,7.8,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2020-02-09,If it wasn't for the horrible traction in my colorway I could have seen myself playing a whole lot in the Why Not Zer0.3.
1,230,9.1,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-01-14,Ten years later and the Nike Kobe 5 is still just as bad ass as it was before.
7,230,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-02-04,This shoe truly is an updated and improved version of the Kobe V. I really like what Nike did by taking all the good things from the OG and updating traction and cushioning.
6,230,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2020-02-04,"I really enjoyed playing in the Kobe 5 again! It takes a little time to break-in, but then you get a super lightweight, minimal, and super comfortable basketball shoe."
3,230,8.8,Schwollo,2020-02-17,Nike improved the traction of the OG Kobe 5 and changed it up with the Zoom Turbo cushioning. I give it a first-team rating!
36,230,8.4,Snkr Tech Talk,2025-03-12,The Nike Kobe 5 Protro is one of my favourite shoes right now. The standout features are the traction and the support.
24,230,8.2,RicheeKim,2020-01-19,This is still a great performer! But $180 is a little steep for the tech you get.
6,231,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2020-02-04,I love the performance of the PG4. This is one of my favorite shoes to play in right now! Probably the most comfortable basketball shoe you can get right now.
19,231,8.6,PureKicks,2020-03-18,"The cushioning is perfect, the traction is beastly, and material, fit, and support are all above-average. If you need new shoes, I recommend the PG4!"
1,231,8.3,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-02-04,"Overall, the Nike PG 4 was very solid, but not as well rounded as I would have liked. The cushion is super comfortable but the containment and support are lacking a little."
3,231,8.2,Schwollo,2020-04-30,"The PG4 is a good solid shoe with no major flaws at a fair price, but it isn�t something that I�d say wow, I want to hoop in these today."
7,231,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2020-01-14,Traction and cushioning are really good but materials and especially support are a little disappointing.
24,231,8.0,RicheeKim,2020-02-04,"For $110, this is a really good shoe. I like the traction, the cushioning is amazing, and for a signature sneaker, the PG4 is super affordable!"
6,232,7.4,The Sole Brothers,2020-01-14,"For $80 it's a good performer, but not as good as the Kyrie Flytrap 2."
24,232,7.0,RicheeKim,2020-02-04,The cushioning is rock hard and the materials feel cheap. I would only recommend these for outdoor use.
15,233,9.5,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2020-02-29,Overall the Way of Wade 8 was fire! These are just a great hoop shoe and the traction was finally superb. These are a double thumbs up.
1,233,9.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-02-18,"Overall, the Way of Wade 8 surprised me and was a great shoe to play in. They are definitely expensive, but I feel like I got what I paid for in the materials and Carbon Fiber. If these sound interesting to you, I'd recommend trying them out and you might be pleasantly surprised."
6,233,9.2,The Sole Brothers,2020-03-18,"Overall, I fully enjoyed playing in this shoe and it will definitely be in my rotation. It is a very responsive shoe with great traction, cushion, and stability to back it up. The craftsmanship of the Way of Wade 8 is incredible."
27,234,8.3,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2020-02-18,"It's not my favorite hoops shoe, but it might work for guards with wider feet who are looking for a very responsive shoe."
6,234,7.6,The Sole Brothers,2020-02-18,"I don't recommend the UA Spawn 2. Cushioning was really bad, traction wasn't good, and the fit didn't work for me at all. Even at $100, there are much better performers out there!"
24,235,8.2,RicheeKim,2020-02-20,"This is a great performer, especially for a budget model! I had a lot of fun playing in the Harden Stepback."
6,235,7.8,The Sole Brothers,2020-02-20,"For an $80 shoe, this is a pretty good performer! Other than the traction on dust and the firm cushioning, I enjoyed the Harden Stepback a lot."
24,236,8.6,RicheeKim,2019-12-18,"If you are only playing on clean courts, I can absolutely recommend the Dame 6 because it's a great performer. If you play on dusty courts be prepared to wipe or better stay away."
6,236,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2019-12-17,"The Dame 6 is probably my favorite shoe in the Dame series. The Lightstrike cushioning is super nice, traction is really good on clean courts and you get all that for a very affordable price!"
19,236,8.2,PureKicks,2020-02-04,"The Dame 6 is super light, comfortable and provides good traction. Unfortunately, it suffers a little from sizing issues and slightly lacking lockdown."
15,236,8.0,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2019-12-26,"Overall, I'm a fan of the Dame 6 and I think it's worth $110. But the traction of the translucent outsole and the durability of the upper material could be better."
29,236,8.0,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,"The Adidas Dame 6 is a good option for the price. The Lightstrike cushion does a good job of balancing bounce with responsiveness and court feel. It feels quick to play in because it is lightweight, but keep in mind that the traction can be inconsistent on dirtier courts."
3,236,7.6,Schwollo,2019-12-20,"Traction could be a little better and the tippy and unstable outsole might be a non-issue for a lot of players but is a no-go for my oft-injured ankles. Other than that, the Dame 6 plays very well in every category."
1,236,6.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-01-03,Traction and support should have been much better. Fit needs work and the materials are as cheap as they come. I can't recommend the Dame 6.
25,236,6.4,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2020-02-04,"I like the looks of the Dame 6, but it just doesn't play good. The Lightstrike foam worked well, but the rest of the shoe was average at best and the traction was legitimately bad."
6,237,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2019-12-26,"For $160, you get Nike's best tech: full-length Zoom Air, Flyknit materials and FlyEase lacing system."
24,237,7.8,RicheeKim,2019-12-26,"The cushioning and materials are great, but traction and fit were problematic for me. Overall, I couldn't enjoy playing in these shoes because they are just too narrow for my feet."
18,237,6.8,AnotherPair [Youtube],2020-01-04,"These are nice shoes for casual wear, but don't wear these on-court!"
1,238,8.7,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-10-30,"The Under Armour Curry 7 is a beast on-court.  Traction and support are awesome, materials work perfectly, and they fit me like a glove. Only the firm cushioning is slightly disappointing."
6,238,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2019-11-15,"The performance of the Under Armour Curry 7 is really nice, especially if you are looking for a quick, minimal low-top shoe. But for $140, the materials and the cushion technology feels a little underwhelming."
19,238,8.4,PureKicks,2020-02-04,The traction is outstanding and everything else is perfectly good. Under Armour really needs to share the secret to their rubber compound!
24,238,8.2,RicheeKim,2019-11-21,This is a great performer with some slight problems: the materials don't feel worthy of a $140 signature model and the cushioning is very firm.
3,238,8.0,Schwollo,2019-11-21,The Curry 7 is a solid all-around shoe with cushioning on the firmer side and some feedback/bounce.
6,239,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2019-11-03,"Puma really surprised me with the Puma Clyde Hardwood. For $120, I 100% recommend this shoe!"
1,239,8.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-11-13,PUMA really nailed it with the Clyde Hardwood. A nice blend of old school leather and modern performance with beastly traction and decent cushioning.
29,239,8.6,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,"The Puma Clyde Hardwood is a great shoe. It's low to the ground, responsive, and has amazing traction. The materials are nice, and they help to create a solid fit. The only thing I wished Puma did was uncage the foam a little more."
1,240,9.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-12-17,This is one of the best basketball shoes of 2019!
24,240,8.8,RicheeKim,2019-11-20,"This is a great performer. I would highly recommend picking up a pair, Kawhi Leonard and New Balance really knocked it out of the park!"
6,240,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2019-11-06,"Incredible! I really like the shoe, especially the super comfortable cushioning."
3,240,8.0,Schwollo,2020-01-02,"I loved the traction and the fit is pretty good, but cushioning is too dense for my liking and containment is seriously lacking."
1,241,9.1,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-11-19,The Nike Kyrie 6 is a great shoe and an evolution of the Kyrie 5 with a few small improvements that are noticeable once you play in them.
2,241,9.1,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2019-11-27,"If you liked the Kyrie 4 or 5, you are going to love the Kyrie 6!"
24,241,9.0,RicheeKim,2019-11-28,"For $130, I would highly recommend getting a pair of Kyrie 6's! These are one of the best performers of the year!"
6,241,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2019-11-28,"I really liked the Kyrie 6, this shoe feels and plays like a Kyrie. The only downsides are the slight bulkiness and the traction on dusty courts."
3,241,8.8,Schwollo,2020-04-07,The Kyrie 6 is one of the best all-around shoes I�ve played in for a long time. It reminds me of the Hyperdunk line as it will work for every player type.
29,241,8.6,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,"The Nike Kyrie 6 is an impressive performance shoe. It feels quick and provides great responsiveness. The cushion is bouncy in the forefoot while still feeling low to the ground, and the traction is amazing. There really aren't many weaknesses in the Kyrie 6."
19,241,8.0,PureKicks,2019-11-20,We really appreciate the great traction and support and good cushioning. But fit and materials show some room for improvement.
1,242,9.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-09-19,"This is the best Air Jordan game shoe since the Air Jordan XX9. They fit well, respond perfectly and the cushioning is amazing."
19,242,9.2,PureKicks,2019-11-13,"The Air Jordan 34 is the highest-rated sneaker in the history of our youtube channel Perfect fit, perfect cushioning and near-perfect traction. It literally does everything well!"
6,242,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2019-09-26,I love playing in the AJ 34. This shoe feels like a Ferrari!
24,242,9.0,RicheeKim,2019-11-06,This is the best performing Jordan model in the last few years - definitely worth the $180 price tag! This shoe is super fun to play in and should work for big guys as well as guards.
4,242,9.0,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2019-12-17,The AJ 34 is a great all-around shoe that�s easy to recommend for anyone willing to pay its $180 price tag.
29,242,9.0,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,"I really liked the Jordan34. It's one of the best Jordan's in the signature line. The forefoot is bouncy, but remains responsive. They did a very good job with materials that are not only lightweight, but also supportive."
11,242,8.8,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2019-11-16,"Combining fantastic cushioning, great traction, and a streamlined look - the Air Jordan 34 is worthy of the GOAT."
3,242,8.8,Schwollo,2019-10-18,"Finally, a new Jordan that does everything well and gets JB fans excited again! If you are looking for new hoops shoes, these are a safe bet because it performs well in every category, except price."
25,242,8.8,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2019-11-16,"The Jordan 34 is easily my favorite basketball sneaker of 2019! This shoe feels like a direct successor to my favorite shoe ever, the AJ 29."
24,243,9.0,RicheeKim,2019-10-06,The Lebron 17 is an awesome shoe! Strongly recommended if you are looking for the best cushioning setup available and you can afford the steep $200 retail price.
1,243,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-10-11,"If it wasn't for the inconsistent traction I would have really enjoyed the Lebron 17. I liked everything, loved some things, but disliked the traction."
6,243,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2019-10-13,"The Lebron 17 is a great shoe - one of our favorite Lebrons. Insane impact protection, incredible traction - there's really nothing to complain about."
19,243,8.8,PureKicks,2019-11-06,This might be the best shoe in the Lebron series!
29,243,8.8,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,The Nike LeBron 17 are very fun to play in. The combination of the traction and cushion was beastly. It is an impressive shoe 17 models into the LeBron signature lineup.
25,243,7.6,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2020-03-18,"The Lebron 17's just aren't going to be for everyone. How high you sit off of the ground is really jarring, but over time I did start to appreciate the Knitposite upper and the cushioning system that is pretty explosive. The Lebron 17 features the largest Air unit ever to be in a basketball sneaker, so if that caters to your playing styles I'd say check these out."
27,244,9.2,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2019-10-10,"The Harden Vol. 4 is fast, controlled, and has been a personal joy to play in. In my personal experience, this is a top performer!"
11,244,9.1,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2019-12-20,"The Harden Vol. 4 is a nice shoe - the traction is good on most surfaces, Lightstrike works but isn�t overly bouncy or plush, and fit and support are good. But overall,  I can't help but feel the Harden Vol.4 took a step back from the Vol.3."
6,244,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2019-10-06,The Adidas Harden Vol. 4 is a really good performer! A perfect shoe for guards looking for a low-to-the-ground and supportive basketball shoe.
3,244,8.8,Schwollo,2019-11-03,"I think this is the best Harden so far! Outstanding traction when clean, great fit right out of the box, very stable and $10 cheaper than the V3."
1,244,8.7,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-10-10,I loved everything about the Harden 4 except the Lightstrike cushioning which was a little too soft and the elastic band in the midfoot which felt a little too tight and snug.
19,244,8.6,PureKicks,2019-11-18,"I am not a low-top fan, but this is the best low-top I've played in a long time!"
29,244,8.6,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,"The Adidas Harden Vol. 4 is a great performer. Adidas used something other than Boost for the first time in a Harden shoe, and the Lightstrike actually felt good. It's lighter than Boost but still felt bouncy. Combined with its consistent traction and solid fit, the Harden Vol. 4 doesn't disappoint."
24,244,8.4,RicheeKim,2019-11-19,"I really enjoyed playing in the Harden Vol. 4. If you are not looking for a ton of impact protection, this is a great performer!"
1,245,8.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-12-17,"The D Rose 10 is much better than the D Rose 9 and will make any Derrick Rose fan happy. But if you are looking for the best bang-for-the buck shoes, there are much better options out there."
24,245,8.0,RicheeKim,2019-10-10,"Me personally, for $140, I wouldn't pick these up because there are much better performers in the same price range."
6,245,7.6,The Sole Brothers,2019-10-21,$140 for budget tech - I don't think the D Rose 10 is a good deal.  The only thing I really liked about these shoes is the cushioning. I won't be playing a lot in the D Rose 10.
1,246,9.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-10-24,"The ANTA KT signature line is very consistent, similar to Nike's Kobe signature line. Even with changing aesthetics, the performance of the shoe remains very similar. The KT5's highlights are traction and cushioning, but overall stability and fit are great as well. If you like these I would definitely recommend them as they should work great for any position or style of play."
29,246,8.6,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,"For the price, the Anta KT5 is a great performing sneaker. It offers quite the bang for your buck with excellent cushion and traction. The materials are also comfortable and help provide solid support."
6,246,8.5,The Sole Brothers,2019-10-10,For $130 you're getting good materials and a comfortable signature shoe with the Anta KT 5 that is a very good overall performer. There are no real weaknesses and I really enjoyed playing in it!
6,247,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2019-10-11,"The Lebron Witness 4 is a very solid performer - especially for $100. If the traction was a little better, this would be a complete banger!"
24,247,7.6,RicheeKim,2019-10-11,"For a $100 you get a decent performer, but even at this price range there are much better shoes out there. I didn't like the cushioning and had some issues with the traction - I can't really recommend these."
27,248,9.0,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2019-11-27,The Jumpman 2020 offers signature-worthy performance for a much lower price.
6,248,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2019-11-27,"For $110, this is a really good performer - highly recommended! Just watch out if you are playing a lot on really dusty courts."
24,248,8.2,RicheeKim,2019-11-27,"For $110, this is a really nice performance basketball shoe! The traction is solid on clean courts and the cushioning was surprisingly good."
1,249,9.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-08-22,The Nike Zoom Rize is an outstanding shoe that works for all types of players.
29,249,9.0,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,"Overall, the Nike Zoom Rize is a great performer that is definitely worth the price. You get a very nice cushion setup, amazing traction, and solid support."
24,249,8.8,RicheeKim,2019-08-23,I would highly recommend the Nike Zoom Rize. I really loved the traction and especially the cushioning - this is the best implementation of Zoom and Phylon ever!
6,249,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2019-08-22,"I really enjoyed playing in the Nike Zoom Rize because of the good traction and amazing cushioning. This shoe will work very well for big guys, but for my style of play, the court feel could have been a little better and the shoe was a little too bulky."
1,250,8.7,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-09-12,"I enjoyed the Kobe AD NXT FastFit much more than I expected. The shape of the outsole is more traditional compared to the Kobe AD NXT 360, the traction durability is better, and the Fast Fit system improves upon the AJ 33."
7,250,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2019-09-04,"You are getting nice materials, futuristic tech, comfort, and great lockdown. But $200 is just too expensive."
6,250,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2019-09-06,"For $200, the Kobe AD NXT FastFit is a pass. It's a nice shoe to play in and looks really, really good, but the performance isn't worth $200."
24,250,8.4,RicheeKim,2019-09-12,"The performance of the Kobe AD NXT FF is really, really good, but if you care about money, $200 is just too expensive."
24,251,7.6,RicheeKim,2019-09-04,$180 is a huge price for an average performer like that. The traction is just too bad - I can't recommend the Nike AlphaDunk.
7,251,7.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2019-09-16,The Nike AlphaDunk is not a good performance basketball shoe! This shoe is way too bulky and the traction is horrible. I can only recommend this shoe to slow and heavy big guys.
6,251,7.4,The Sole Brothers,2019-09-04,"No! Don't get it! Especially for $180, this is a no go. The traction was just horrible and I don't like the aesthetics either."
6,252,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2019-08-05,"100% recommended, especially for $90!"
24,252,6.8,RicheeKim,2019-08-05,"Even for only $90, I wouldn't recommend this shoe. The materials are absolute trash and there are just too many stability and containment issues."
24,253,9.0,RicheeKim,2019-08-07,"I think the Diamond Mid is a great performer with premium materials, awesome traction, and a unique look."
2,253,9.0,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2019-10-18,"Jordan Brand has really stepped up their game lately. The Jumpman Diamond is a dynamic shoe with great build, fit and materials - and it comes at a very fair price!"
6,253,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2019-08-07,"The ankle area was pretty uncomfortable for me, everything else about this shoe is incredible!"
27,254,8.6,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2019-08-15,"Traction, cushion, and textile choice are all very good but the break-in and fit of this pair were difficult to overcome."
6,254,7.6,The Sole Brothers,2019-08-15,"Don't get it! Traction is trash. Even for $100, this shoe is too expensive for what you get."
19,254,7.4,PureKicks,2019-10-24,The Pro Bounce 2019 is a good shoe but doesn't live up to the Pro Bounce 2018.
24,254,7.2,RicheeKim,2019-08-15,I can't really recommend the Pro Bounce 2019 because of the cheap materials and bad traction.
27,255,9.1,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2019-10-11,"The Jordan Zoom Zero Gravity is a fast, lightweight, low-top performer at a very affordable price!"
24,255,8.0,RicheeKim,2019-08-24,For $100 you get a solid performance hoop shoe. The Zoom Zero Gravity features great traction and solid materials - the only downside is the firm cushioning.
7,256,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2019-07-09,The Zoom Freak 1 is a solid first signature sneaker for Giannis Antetokounmpo. Support and lockdown are great but cushioning and traction feel pretty standard and the quality of the upper materials could be better.
6,256,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2019-07-13,"I enjoyed the Zoom Freak 1, but the cushioning and traction could be better. Unfortunately, this shoe is one tier below the top-performers and, at $120, a little too expensive for what you get."
25,256,8.0,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2019-07-02,"A solid on-court performer. I' give it a B performance-wise, because there are better shoes out there that give you more bang-for-the-buck."
19,256,8.0,PureKicks,2019-08-18,The Nike Zoom Freak 1 has definitely a place in my sneaker rotation because it is super comfortable to play in.
1,256,7.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-07-10,"The Nike Zoom Freak 1 is a good shoe, but not a great one. Court feel and one-to-one fit are great, but impact protection and traction are disappointing."
3,256,7.8,Schwollo,2019-07-18,The Freak 1 does nothing outstandingly well but that�s okay because it does everything well enough.
29,256,7.8,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,"The Nike Zoom Freak 1 is a very low-to-the-ground sneaker. It's lightweight and provides a good amount of court feel, but the cushion could have been better in the forefoot area of the shoe."
24,256,7.5,RicheeKim,2019-07-26,"If you like Kobe models - you are probably going to enjoy the Zoom Freak 1. But for $120, there are better performers out there."
7,257,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2019-07-20,"I am pretty satisfied with the performance of the DON issue #1. My favorite aspects are the traction, the super-responsive cushioning and the awesome price point of $100."
1,257,8.7,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-07-21,I actually loved the D.O.N. Issue 1 with the exception of the traction.
25,257,8.5,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2019-09-09,"At $99, this shoe provides a ton of performance! I'd say this is the best under $100 sneaker currently on the market. The DON issue 1 is a very versatile shoe and should work for all players!"
6,257,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2019-07-09,I didn't like the DON Issue 1 too much. It's heavy and chunky and the traction is too inconsistent.
29,257,8.2,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,"The Adidas DON Issue #1 is a great shoe for anyone who is looking for a quick, responsive and supportive performer. It has plenty of court feel and the traction was consistent. My only gripe is that they could've made the cushion a bit bouncier."
24,257,8.0,RicheeKim,2019-07-23,"I will keep this shoe because of the good-looking Spiderman collaboration but I think there are better performers, even at $100."
19,257,8.0,PureKicks,2019-08-15,The DON Issue 1 is a very comfortable and supportive shoe that works perfectly for explosive basketball players.
24,258,9.0,RicheeKim,2019-07-31,"For only $90, this is an amazing performer! A minimal shoe for players who like court feel over impact protection."
6,258,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2019-07-13,"Great performer! I would not change anything about this shoe, besides the traction."
1,259,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-08-08,The Under Armour HOVR Havoc 2 is another solid basketball shoe with traction that's built Ford tough and cushioning that's a little firm but kept me stable and made me feel faster than I really am.
6,259,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2019-07-13,The HOVR Havoc 2 is a good performer but a step down from top-tier performers. I liked almost everything about this shoe but the traction was a little too inconsistent for me.
24,259,8.6,RicheeKim,2019-07-31,"Except for the occasional slip out, the HOVR Havoc 2 is a very good performer. But I think that you can find better-performing sneakers at $120."
1,260,9.1,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-08-03,The Lebron Soldier 13 performs well in every category - on hardwood and blacktop!
24,260,9.0,RicheeKim,2019-07-18,"For a pretty solid price of $140, you get awesome cushioning, great traction, great fit, and great materials. The straps also work really well on this version of the Lebron Solider and don't come undone like on previous models."
19,260,8.8,PureKicks,2019-09-12,This is one of the best-reviewed shoes in the history of our Youtube channel!
29,260,8.8,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,"The Nike LeBron Soldier 13 features one of the best traction setups to go with the plush cushioning. The materials get the job done. Support and lockdown perform well, with the only complaint being that the lateral containment could be a tad bit better."
6,260,8.3,The Sole Brothers,2019-07-21,I enjoyed playing in the Lebron Soldier 13 - it's a good performer. But cushioning could have been better and the $140 price tag is pretty expensive.
6,261,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2019-06-11,Get them! The Converse All Star Pro BB is freaking awesome.
1,261,8.3,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-06-11,The Converse All Star Pro BB is a really good basketball shoe. I especially liked the one-to-one fit and the lightweight feel but the traction and the insole lining could be improved.
24,261,8.0,RicheeKim,2019-08-22,"For $140, I would not recommend the Converse Pro BB just because of the inconsistent traction."
19,261,7.6,PureKicks,2020-04-01,"The traction and cushioning are A1, but the fit and support are a real lockdown. Wear double socks and an ankle brace and you will have a lot of fun."
1,262,9.1,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-06-20,The CP3 12 is a no-nonsense type of shoe that offers a lot of performance for it�s $100 price point. I'm pleasantly surprised!
6,262,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2019-06-12,This is a top-tier performer with premium materials at a great retail price of only $100!
24,262,8.6,RicheeKim,2019-07-18,For $100 this shoe is a freaking steal! It's an absolute beast of a performer - highly recommended!
1,263,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-06-20,"If you want a fairly light, low and fast shoe without any weaknesses then the Kyrie Low 2 is a great choice!"
27,263,8.6,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2019-07-11,The Kyrie Low 2 ticks all the boxes for me. My favorite Kyrie I have played in so far!
19,263,8.6,PureKicks,2019-07-26,"A supportive low-top, with great traction and good cushioning - it's all I ever wanted!"
6,263,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2019-06-20,"For only $110, get them! This is probably the best Kyrie model out there right now. The only thing that should have been better, is the stiff and uncomfortable cushioning."
24,263,8.4,RicheeKim,2019-07-26,"For $110, this is an absolute steal. Traction is the most important thing in a basketball shoe for me, and the traction of the Kyrie Low 2 is absolutely money!"
6,264,7.6,The Sole Brothers,2019-04-12,"The Mamba Focus is really cheap and the performance is okay, but there are much better shoes even at similarly low prices (Nike PG3, Kyrie Flytrap 2)."
24,264,7.3,RicheeKim,2019-04-12,"I wouldn't recommend the Kobe Mamba Focus. The traction isn't good, impact protection is very minimal, and the fit was really uncomfortable for my wide feet."
1,265,9.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-05-08,The Nike KD 12 is just an all-around good shoe that should cater to most players needs.
15,265,9.2,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2019-05-08,"When they�re this nice, you might want to buy �em twice. I can't stop playing in my KD 12's!"
24,265,9.0,RicheeKim,2019-04-18,This is the best performer of this year so far! A huge step up from the disappointing previous KD models.
7,265,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2019-05-08,The cushioning alone is worth the $150! But I would have preferred a little more premium materials.
3,265,8.6,Schwollo,2019-04-18,"The directly-underfoot Zoom set up makes the KD 12 feel fun and exciting. Other than that, this shoe does everything well from A-Z."
6,265,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2019-04-18,"They fixed a lot of things that I didn't like in the predecessor KD11. The cushioning is amazing, materials are solid, fit and support are great! The only downside is the inconsistent traction of the translucent rubber on dusty courts."
19,265,8.4,PureKicks,2019-06-11,This shoe is not a joke! You never felt anything like this full-length Zoom cushioning system and there is finally solid support in a KD shoe.
19,266,8.8,PureKicks,2019-06-11,Insane traction and amazing cushioning -  this shoe is an absolute madness!
27,266,8.6,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2019-04-06,"No matter what position or style you play, you won't be disappointed with the Adidas Pro Bounce Madness!"
6,266,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2019-04-06,I really like the casual look and the performance on clean courts. Just make sure you don't play on dusty courts with these.
24,266,8.2,RicheeKim,2019-04-06,The Pro Bounce is a solid shoe but the traction just didn't do it for me on dusty courts.
27,267,9.2,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2019-02-11,"Paul George�s signature sneaker represent him well: these are the perfect shoes for a smooth, two-way player that can get busy when necessary."
6,267,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2019-02-01,"The PG3 performs exceptionally well! I really, really enjoyed playing in these. Definitely one of the best basketball shoes out right now."
7,267,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2019-02-11,I really like everything about the PG3 except the materials and the looks.
1,267,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-02-23,"I hated the PG3 after my first few hours in them. However, I�m glad I stuck with them as by the end of the week I was just excited to lace them up for another few hours of pick-up runs"
19,267,8.6,PureKicks,2019-03-07,Easily the best PG sneaker so far! This is one of my favorite Nike shoes in a long time.
3,267,8.6,Schwollo,2019-03-19,The PG3 gives you everything you want in a low top for a lower-than-average price. I have zero complaints!
7,268,9.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2019-02-23,"I promise you will not get disappointed if you pick the Dame 5. If the cushioning was a little softer and the traction a little better on dusty courts, this shoe might have received the first ever perfect rating from me."
11,268,9.0,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2019-02-23,This is the best Dame shoe yet and that is saying a lot! The Dame 5 combines the best categories of the previous models and gives us a shoe that any player can wear and feel strong.
1,268,8.9,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2020-04-26,"The Dame 5 is solid all the way around: great traction, great cushion, superior lockdown, wonderful support, and stability."
24,268,8.8,RicheeKim,2019-02-23,"At $115, the Dame 5 is a very good performance basketball shoe. The traction took a while to break in, but other than that, everything about this shoe is really nice."
19,268,8.8,PureKicks,2019-03-07,The Adidas Dame 5 is an incredible shoe. The Bounce cushioning is absolutely amazing and the herringbone traction pattern is close to perfect.
3,268,8.6,Schwollo,2019-02-23,"Get the basics down and you have a great shoe. Thank you Adidas and Dame! This is the best Dame ever, as Adidas finally found the right combo of everything, especially traction."
6,268,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2019-02-23,"I really enjoyed playing in the Dame 5 on clean courts. The cushion is pretty damn nice, materials are nice, fit is good and it's also very supportive. This is a solid performer at a very fair price. Just make sure you don't get the translucent rubber versions if you plan to play on dusty courts."
6,269,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2019-02-23,"This is a solid, solid performer, especially at the price of $110. The traction is excellent, the cushioning is soft, and the materials are pretty nice and comfortable."
1,269,8.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-02-23,"The traction on this shoe is absolutely awesome and the Micro G cushioning feels really good. Unfortunately, the fit wasn't perfect for my feet."
24,269,8.8,RicheeKim,2019-03-12,"For $110 you really can't go wrong with the Anatomix Spawn Low. It doesn't have the big-name brand attached, and the looks might not be amazing, but the performance is top notch!"
11,269,8.8,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2019-04-06,"If you are looking for a low, fast, cushioned ride that will draw some attention for the looks and colors, the Anatomix Spawn is it."
3,269,8.4,Schwollo,2019-03-07,"Even though this shoe has very little in common with its predecessors, it performs very well all around with excellent traction and a pretty good fit if you ignore the bubbles in the forefoot. I prefer these over the Curry 6 when it comes to performance."
19,269,8.2,PureKicks,2019-04-06,"This is my favorite Under Armour shoe so far! I love the fit, the Micro G cushioning, and the excellent traction."
7,270,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2019-03-07,"Even though this isn't really a performance upgrade to the Kobe 4, this is still a really good performance shoe. However, I don't think they are worth $175."
3,270,8.6,Schwollo,2019-03-07,I love that Nike didn�t change a thing. And why should they when it�s one of the best low tops of all time?
6,270,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2019-03-07,"This shoe feels more Retro than Protro. They will probably make it into my rotation, but the price of $175 is pretty steep."
1,270,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-03-11,"The Nike Kobe 4 is one of the greatest basketball shoes of all-time but I expected the inclusion of forefoot cushion for a performance-upgraded shoe. For $175 they could have, and should have, given us more."
24,270,8.5,RicheeKim,2019-07-07,"The Protro 4 is a very solid performer - if you are a Kobe fan get them! But at the price of $175, there are way better shoes out there."
25,270,8.5,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2019-09-26,"For $175, these feel like a sneaker from 2009 trying to keep up in 2019."
11,271,8.6,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2019-05-28,"The Puma Uproar is a fun shoe! If you are looking for a moderately-cushioned shoe with near-perfect lockdown and traction, look no further."
1,271,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-04-12,"Puma really has impressed me quite a bit. The cushioning could be a little better, but everything else worked perfectly!"
6,271,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2019-03-07,I enjoyed playing in these. This shoe is a jack of all trades but master of none.
6,272,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2019-03-07,Even ignoring the fast-fit adaptive lacing system - this is a really nice performance basketball shoe. On top of that - this is a real head-turner!
19,272,8.6,PureKicks,2019-05-08,The first-ever self-lacing basketball shoe is here - and it's one of the best basketball shoes we have ever played in.
24,272,8.4,RicheeKim,2019-05-08,"The Nike Adapt BB is a good performance basketball shoe. But there are better performers for much cheaper. So if you are a sneakerhead, or really into innovative tech, then this is a great shoe!"
25,272,8.2,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2019-04-06,I had a lot of fun playing in the Nike Adapt BB. The self-lacing system works well and the overall performance is really solid. Pick these up if you are interested in the latest tech and you can afford the hefty price tag!
1,273,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-01-06,The Curry 6 is easily the best shoe in the Curry signature line.
15,273,9.0,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2019-01-06,I am loving the Curry 6! Definitely the #1 in my rotation right now.
7,273,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2019-01-13,"In my opinion, this is the best Curry signature shoe since the Curry 2. Everything about this shoe is great, except the pain I experienced on the top of the feet when cranking the laces tightly."
24,273,9.0,RicheeKim,2019-01-13,"The Curry 6 is a really fun performer that has everything I want from a basketball shoe: amazing cushion, amazing fit, and while the traction is not quite on Curry 2 level, it is still pretty nice! The durability of the rubber on my pair was an issue though..."
11,273,9.0,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2019-02-01,"The Curry 6 brings a great combo of traction, cushioning and support to make fast basketball player very happy!"
2,273,9.0,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2019-02-23,This is easily the most well-rounded Curry we�ve had since the 1.
6,273,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2019-01-09,"I really enjoy playing in the Curry 6. The cushioning is pretty nice, the traction, fit, support and the minimal upper are really fun. The only problem is the durability of my pair - let's hope the glue work is better on future colorways!"
19,273,8.2,PureKicks,2019-02-01,"Easily the best Curry signature shoe! The cushioning is amazing, materials are really nice, the traction took care of us, only the support was a little bit of a letdown."
3,273,8.0,Schwollo,2019-01-17,"The Curry 6 looks good, has great traction and is very stable, but the constant lace pressure, bad heel fit, and a really dumb outsole design make these far from perfect."
1,274,9.1,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-02-01,"The Why Not Zero.2 is quick, comfortable, supportive, and breaks in quickly."
7,274,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2019-01-13,"Traction is superb, materials are 50:50, support is solid, cushioning is responsive in the forefoot and comfortable in the heel. There is nothing bad about the Why Not Zero.2, but there is also nothing phenomenal. Not the best shoe I ever played in but a good performer overall."
6,274,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2019-01-17,"I really enjoyed playing in the Jordan Why Not Zero.2. They look great, the price is right, whatever position you play - you are going to enjoy these!"
3,274,9.0,Schwollo,2019-04-06,I�ve literally got nothing to complain about with this shoe. Jordan made the Why Not Zero.2 a lot more fun with a bouncier cushioning set-up while keeping the shoe just great all around.
24,274,8.8,RicheeKim,2019-03-11,For $125 this is a really nice shoe - highly recommended! The traction and fit are the outstanding features for me.
15,274,8.3,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2019-01-23,Overall this shoe is really dope. The only downside is that the traction is a downgrade compared to the first Russell Westbrook sneaker.
25,274,8.0,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2019-03-07,"I think the Jordan Why Not Zero.2 are a solid performer, and fun to play in. But the hefty materials, the uncomfortableness I experienced in the collar area and the uneven support in the heel to forefoot throw them off."
19,274,8.0,PureKicks,2019-04-06,"The cushioning is absolutely amazing and reminds me of the AJ29. This is an amazing overall performer, Russell Westbrook and Jordan Brand should be proud!"
6,275,8.3,The Sole Brothers,2019-01-21,I really liked playing in these shoes! If just wished the cushioning was a little more comfortable.
1,275,7.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-03-07,"The Nike Kyrie Flytrap 2 is a very solid shoe in most aspects, but cushion could definitely use some improvement."
6,276,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2018-12-14,The $165 is justified by the premium materials and great build quality. This is a great performer with very comfortable cushioning - I thoroughly enjoyed playing in these!
15,276,8.6,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2018-12-14,The Wade 7 is a fun shoe to play - definitely recommended!
1,276,7.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-03-07,I am not a big fan of the Wade 7 on-court and I definitely don�t want to play in them again.
27,277,9.1,Jalique Gabay [weartesters.com],2019-01-06,This modern take on an old school hoop shoe is a great all-around performer but needs a little patience to break-in.
3,277,8.8,Schwollo,2019-01-06,This might just be the shoe of the year 2018!
6,277,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2019-01-06,The Marquee Boost is a very nice performer at an affordable price - I am impressed!
24,277,8.7,RicheeKim,2019-01-06,The Marquee Boost is a great performer but I would recommend the Low version if you like freedom of movement around your ankles.
19,277,8.4,PureKicks,2019-01-13,The most comfortable shoe in the game. Adidas is doing a great job lately!
1,277,8.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-01-17,The Adidas Marquee Boost is definitely one of the more comfortable basketball shoes currently available.
24,278,9.1,RicheeKim,2018-12-17,Adidas really knocked this one out of the park. Really fun to play in!
11,278,8.8,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2019-01-06,"Adidas has made a really, REALLY fun shoe. Luckily, the price matched the performance and was truly� N3XT L3V3L."
6,278,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2019-01-06,"I really, really want to like this shoe, but traction is the most important aspect for me, and the Adidas Next Level didn't work on dusty courts. On clean courts, I liked it a lot!"
19,278,8.4,PureKicks,2019-04-06,"Amazing cushion, fantastic herringbone traction, and comfortable Primeknit upper. The fit works out great, even without laces!"
3,278,8.0,Schwollo,2019-02-11,"The N3xt L3v3l is super comfortable and has a nice cushioning setup, but during play, the laceless system just doesn�t work like it should or could."
24,279,8.6,RicheeKim,2019-01-06,"This is a pretty fun shoe to play in! If you are a T-Mac fan go for them, but there are better bang-for-the-buck shoes out there."
3,279,8.4,Schwollo,2019-01-06,"I really enjoy playing in this shoe because it does everything well. I especially love the cushioning set up, traction, and as shallow as this sounds, its looks."
6,279,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2019-01-13,"I was super-impressed by the performance of the T-Mac Millenium. Much better than the original T-Mac! This is a very durable shoe, that should work well for big guys who need a lot of support and cushioning."
6,280,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2019-02-01,"For $100 this would have been a really, really solid performer if it hadn't been for the cushion.  Only recommended if you play on clean courts."
1,280,8.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2019-02-01,"For under $100 retail I can't think of a more versatile shoe. However, I think there are other decently priced sneakers that perform much better."
4,281,9.3,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2018-12-14,"Simply put, the Kyrie 5 is a fantastic shoe for the money, and would be a fantastic shoe at any price."
7,281,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-11-19,I really like the Nike Zoom Air Turbo and the Flytrap shroud. The Kyrie 5 is an upgrade over the Kyrie 4 and works best for quick players who prefer court feel over soft cushioning.
6,281,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2018-12-03,"I love these! If you liked the Kyrie 2 or 4, then you are going to love the Kyrie 5."
1,281,8.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-12-04,"The Nike Kyrie 5 offers plenty of court feel, a little bit of cushion, great lockdown and aggressive traction wrapped up in a lightweight package."
2,281,8.7,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2019-01-06,The Kyrie 5 is a fun shoe that caters to the needs of those that play a more grounded game and require unrestricted mobility.
3,281,8.3,Schwollo,2018-12-14,"This is a very good shoe that does everything well with great traction, fit, and decent cushioning."
10,281,8.2,MR FOAMER SIMPSON,2019-02-23,"The Kyrie 5 is a very solid shoe. The main pros are lockdown and court feel, cons are the cushioning of the outsole and the lacking padding of the inner material."
19,281,7.6,PureKicks,2019-01-06,"The Kyrie 5 is a solid shoe. The support and cushioning are great, but the traction is disappointing."
25,281,7.6,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2019-02-11,The Kyrie 5 probably won't find its way back into my gym bag any time soon - the traction was just too bad in my pair.
1,282,8.7,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-10-11,The Puma Clyde Court Disrupt wound up being one of the more fun models to play in this year (so far).   Not in the Top 5 discussion but you receive solid performance and cushion for the price.
10,282,8.7,MR FOAMER SIMPSON,2018-10-30,The Puma Clyde Court Disrupt is a very vibrant and well-rounded sneaker. I really like them and I am pleasantly surprised by their performance.
15,282,8.5,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2018-10-20,Overall the Puma Clyde Court is a really fun shoe to play in. Great job by Puma!
25,282,8.4,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2018-12-14,"It's really impressive what Puma was able to do in their first basketball sneaker in a long time. The materials and fit are absolutely A1, the support and traction, however,  could use a little tweaking."
6,282,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2018-11-19,The performance is middle of the road. They won't stay in my rotation but they might work well as a big-man shoe or as an outdoor shoe.
7,282,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-10-08,"I am very impressed by the first hoops shoe by Puma after their comeback to basketball. The cushioning and traction could be a little better, but everything else was great!"
4,282,8.0,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2018-10-30,The Puma Clyde Court Disrupt is a great first impression for Puma's relaunched basketball division.
19,282,7.2,PureKicks,2019-01-06,Welcome back Puma! This is a strong shoe that is only let down by the lacking ankle support and bad traction on dusty courts.
1,283,9.1,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-10-16,The traction and cushion are very solid but the FastFit lacing system has room for improvement and may throw some people off.
6,283,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2018-10-08,We love the new FastFit lacing system. The Air Jordan 33 will definitely be in my rotation even though it is a bit heavy and clunky.
11,283,8.8,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2019-01-06,"The Air Jordan 33 is a great shoe, especially for big guys looking for impact protection and support. Quick guards looking for a light and minimal shoe should look elsewhere."
24,283,8.8,RicheeKim,2019-05-08,"Even at the hefty price of $175, I really enjoyed playing in these. The AIr Jordan 33 is a great performer that really stands out on the court thanks to the fast-fit lacing system."
25,283,8.3,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2019-01-13,"I can't recommend the Air Jordan 33 because they never really broke in for me. The midsole remained extremely stiff and uncomfortable, even after 30 hours of 5 vs 5 play."
3,283,8.0,Schwollo,2019-02-11,"Overall, the Air Jordan 33 is a good shoe if you love the looks and the innovative sneaker tech. It performs well in almost every aspect but I think $175 is too expensive for what you get. $130 would be a much fairer retail price."
19,283,7.2,PureKicks,2018-11-08,"The Fast Fit system is no gimmick, the support is great, but the materials are a letdown - there are just too many!"
7,283,7.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-10-30,"I am very disappointed in the Air Jordan 33. The traction is inconsistent, the materials are subpar and the comfort is a disaster!"
6,284,10.0,The Sole Brothers,2018-10-18,This is the best performer of 2018. I am going to get five pairs of these!
1,284,9.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-11-19,The performance of the Adidas Harden Volume 3 on the court is nearly perfect. It's a special shoe in that it's so simple that it does everything right!
11,284,9.1,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-10-30,"This is the best Harden we have seen so far. Works for players at any position who enjoy freedom of movement, court feel with above-average impact protection, and a great fit."
7,284,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-10-30,This is by far the best shoe in the Harden signature series. Pretty much everything was improved - I especially like the cushioning and materials.
24,284,9.0,RicheeKim,2018-10-30,Definitely an upgrade over the Harden 2. This shoe has pretty much everything I want in a performance sneaker!
4,284,8.8,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2018-11-19,The Harden 3 is a standout when it comes to performance! It checks all the boxes for comfort and fit and does so at a relatively affordable $140 price point.
3,284,8.6,Schwollo,2018-10-30,"Great traction, pretty good fit and fun Boost cushioning - sign me up! I�m going to give this a first-team rating."
19,284,8.0,PureKicks,2019-01-06,"Fit and cushion are awesome, but the traction was a little too inconsistent and the support a little too low."
1,285,9.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-10-30,The Anta KT4 is a ton of fun to play in. You�ve got to try them for yourself.
29,285,8.8,MARKCHES,2021-05-07,"Overall, the Anta KT4 is one of the best performing sneakers available. The cushion is both bouncy and responsive. The traction is awesome, and it has all the support you need."
6,285,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2018-10-30,For $125 you get premium materials and modern tech. I enjoyed playing in these a lot! The only issues are the slightly mushy cushioning and the problematic containment on lateral cuts.
1,286,9.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-10-04,"The LeBron 16 will suit any play style or move � be it slashing, cutting, shooters, defense, rebounding."
6,286,9.3,The Sole Brothers,2018-10-02,"I really, really like the Lebron 16. The price is expensive but justified by the amazing tech and ultra-premium feel."
7,286,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-09-26,"The Lebron 16 is an upgrade in every aspect! They look better, they feel better, and they perform better!"
24,286,9.0,RicheeKim,2018-10-01,The Lebron 16 is an outstanding performer!
3,286,8.8,Schwollo,2018-10-01,"Everything I didn't like about the Lebron 15 was fixed! Better traction, better stability, and containment. This is the best Lebron to come out in years!"
25,286,8.8,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2018-10-01,"The cushioning setup is super fun to play in, the traction worked on every court and the Battleknit 2.0 is super comfortable. The Lebron 16 is a very versatile shoe, but explosive and fast wing players will particularly love this hoops shoe."
10,286,8.8,MR FOAMER SIMPSON,2018-10-18,"Awesone impact protection, really good traction, but the court feel is minimal and the Lebron 16 is pretty heavy."
19,286,8.0,PureKicks,2019-01-06,Cushioning and traction are awesome but the fit and support were a bit of a letdown for me.
24,287,9.0,RicheeKim,2018-09-26,The Adidas Pro Bounce Low is a great shoe that is absolutely perfect for me. Everything about this shoe is amazing and the cheap price point makes it even better!
6,287,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2018-09-26,The Adidas Pro Bounce Low is a great all-around shoe that should work especially well for guards.
19,287,8.6,PureKicks,2018-11-29,"Right now, this is by far my favorite shoe to hoop in. If you enjoy playing in low-tops then this is the perfect shoe for you!"
1,287,8.3,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-10-08,The Pro Bounce Low is a very solid shoe that can be used for all positions.
6,288,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2018-10-19,"These are up there on the budget category. I would totally recommend the Jordan Jumpman Hustle, as they are one of the best performers of the year!"
24,288,8.8,RicheeKim,2018-10-19,"I think the Jordan Jumpman Hustle is a great performer, especially after you break-in the traction a little bit."
1,288,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-10-19,"The Jordan Jumpman Hustle is super comfortable, very lightweight and the shoe won�t break the bank. Traction and cushioning are great but support could be better."
2,288,8.6,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2018-11-19,"Overall, the Jordan Jumpman Hustle was a delight to play in."
24,289,8.1,RicheeKim,2018-09-26,"Personally, I would not recommend the KD11 for basketball because of the missing lateral support. Playing in these shoes had me scared about my ankles."
6,289,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2018-07-16,"The KD 11 is a decent performer, but it just wasn't for me. I would recommend this shoe only to bigger pull-up shooters - there just isn't enough support for quicker players like me."
7,289,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-08-08,I was really disappointed because I expected more. The KD11 looks nice and is very comfortable but the performance aspects like support and traction just aren't as good as I had hoped.
3,289,7.8,Schwollo,2018-09-26,"If you want a sock-like shoe with great cushioning then you are going to love the KD11. Unfortunately, the missing support and lacking containment are issues I personally can't ignore in a performance basketball shoe."
19,289,7.4,PureKicks,2018-09-26,"Cushioning, materials, and traction are great. The only problem is the lack of support."
4,289,7.3,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2018-08-08,The Nike KD11 looks like a comfortable casual sneaker but doesn't work on a basketball court for me because of the lacking support and stability.
1,289,6.7,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-08-10,The KD11 is one of the most disappointing shoes I reviewed in a while. The fully knit build is just not supportive enough for a performance basketball shoe - use some leather Nike!
7,290,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-09-26,"Good traction, good cushioning and the support and lockdown are on point. The materials may look cheap but they perform well.  Overall, a very solid hoops shoe!"
4,290,8.5,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2018-10-08,"The latest Nike Kobe A.D. isn't spectacular, but it is an easy recommendation for players whose priorities lean towards light, minimal, and low shoes."
24,290,8.5,RicheeKim,2018-10-30,"It's a great performing shoe, but for a Kobe signature model, the look and in-hand feel of the materials are disappointing."
15,290,8.4,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2018-10-01,"I like everything about this shoe! I just wished they would have taken the cushion from the Kobe AD NXT 360, because then it would have been my shoe of the year!"
3,290,8.4,Schwollo,2018-10-16,It doesn't have the latest and greatest tech but this is definitely one of the more fun shoes I played in this year.
11,290,8.3,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-10-01,"The Kobe AD Exodus isn't the best Kobe ever, but it does almost everything well on-court and is smooth on foot. Works especially well for quicker ""Kyrie-like"" guards."
1,290,8.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-09-26,"I like the Nike Kobe AD Exodus but I don�t love it. The Exodus is lightweight, low profile, and provides aggressive traction � it�s a shoe built for a fast-paced player that gets up and down the court."
25,290,8.0,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2018-09-26,"I am having fun in the Kobe AD, but the traction is problematic."
6,290,7.1,The Sole Brothers,2018-09-26,"Tech-wise it's not great but performance is solid and it looks good. Overall, we are a little underwhelmed though and the Kobe AD Exodus probably won't make it into our rotation."
24,291,8.8,RicheeKim,2018-09-26,"For a retail price of $100, this is an outstanding shoe."
1,291,8.7,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-09-26,If the Curry 3 Zero2 came with a heel counter it would be the perfect guard shoe.
3,291,8.6,Schwollo,2018-09-26,"The Steph Curry 3 Zero2 does almost everything exceptionally well with traction, fit and stability being the very high highlights."
6,291,7.2,The Sole Brothers,2018-09-26,"The performance is okay for a budget model, but these won't make it into the rotation."
6,292,9.3,The Sole Brothers,2018-10-16,"The HOVR cushioning was a bit disappointing, but other than that, the Under Armour HOVR Havoc is an amazing performer with awesome traction and a very minimal, low-to-the-ground feel."
11,292,9.1,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-10-12,"If you are looking for a seriously quick, responsive, biting-traction shoe, the HOVR Havoc Low will more than satisfy."
24,292,8.9,RicheeKim,2018-10-01,This is one of my top 5 performance basketball shoes of 2018 so far!
3,292,8.2,Schwollo,2018-09-26,"Okay overall, but nothing great aside from traction, stability, and containment."
24,293,8.0,RicheeKim,2018-09-26,I would not recommend this shoe as it felt super stiff and clunky.
6,293,7.4,The Sole Brothers,2018-09-26,I didn't really enjoy playing in these shoes. Probably works better if you are a big guy who plays in the low post.
24,294,8.7,RicheeKim,2018-07-16,"For $110, you will not be disappointed! The Kyrie Low is a good all-around performer and a lot of fun to play in."
11,294,8.7,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-10-20,"The package of traction, court feel, and fit make the Kyrie Low ideal for most guards and any other player not needing a wide shoe or supreme cushioning."
6,294,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2018-08-08,I really enjoyed playing in the Kyrie Low. If you don't need a lot of impact protection then this shoe is a great choice!
1,294,7.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-10-12,"Better than the Kyrie 2 and 1, but not as good as the Kyrie 3 or 4."
24,295,8.0,RicheeKim,2018-08-08,I would not recommend this shoe for $140. The traction is pretty bad and the fit didn't work for me.
15,295,7.8,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2018-09-26,"The D Rose 9 is a solid performer, but there are better performers at a more affordable price out there."
6,295,7.5,The Sole Brothers,2018-08-08,"We loved the cushioning! Unfortunately, the traction is lackluster and the fit works only for players with very wide feet."
11,295,7.0,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-08-08,"If you require traction and lockdown from your basketball shoes you need to look elsewhere. You should only get the D Rose 9 if you are a stationary shooter, you don't rely on quickness and you like the look and casual appeal of the D Rose 9."
7,296,9.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-08-08,"This is an awesome performer with great tech at an affordable price. Cushion, traction, and materials stayed the same but the fit and support are slightly improved!"
24,296,8.8,RicheeKim,2018-08-08,I would pick the PG 2.5 over the PG 2 as they look better and provide a more customizable fit thanks to the forefoot strap.
6,296,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2018-08-08,The performance stayed exactly the same but we think the PG 2.5 looks better than the PG2.
11,297,8.7,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-09-26,"If you need a dependable shoe for any indoor surface, with great cushioning, a semi-durable upper, and killer fit, look no further than the Nike Hyperdunk X"
24,297,8.6,RicheeKim,2018-09-26,"For a fair list price of $130, this is a very solid performer."
3,297,8.4,Schwollo,2019-01-13,"The HD X is a jack of all trades which I really love. If the traction and containment were a little better, these Hyperdunks would be close to perfect!"
19,297,7.0,PureKicks,2018-09-26,"The Hyperdunk X is an above average performer. The fit, materials, and support do very well. Unfortunately, the traction on mildly dusty courts is a bit disappointing."
24,298,8.4,RicheeKim,2018-09-26,"I would definitely recommend the Hyperdunk X Low, the only downside is the inconsistent traction."
6,298,7.8,The Sole Brothers,2018-08-08,"The traction could have been a little bit better, other than that, the Hyperdunk X Low is a good performer!"
19,298,7.4,PureKicks,2018-09-26,The Hyperdunk X Low gets the job done. I really enjoyed playing in these!
6,299,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2018-06-12,For $110 this is a steal! This might be one of the best performance basketball shoes I played in this year.
1,299,8.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-08-08,The Jordan Lockdown is not only a great bang for the buck but also one of the best shoes released in 2018 so far.
11,299,8.6,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-06-12,"The Jordan Fly Lockdown is a budget Jordan model that performs like a signature shoe. Works best if you need a stable, low-riding foot rocket."
11,300,9.2,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-04-17,"If you need traction for days, cushioning that is stable but provides great impact protection, and a supportive, stable base look no further � the CP3.XI should be a shoe for you, no matter the position."
24,300,9.0,RicheeKim,2018-04-30,"The CP3.XI is one of my favorite shoes to play in right now.  Great cushioning, comfortable fit and nice low-to-the-ground feel. This shoe has everything I like in a shoe and nothing that I don't."
1,300,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-06-12,"The CP3 XI is definitely a step in the right direction as cushion, comfort, and traction have all been upgraded compared to the predecessors. It's a very well-rounded shoe that should appeal to a lot of players."
6,300,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2018-04-17,The CP3.XI is a solid performer that works very well for guards who look for a supportive low-cut shoe.
6,301,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2018-04-17,"I love playing in the Curry 5. This shoe excelled in every single category. Sole Brothers recommended, just not on dusty courts."
3,301,8.0,Schwollo,2018-04-30,The Curry 5 is what I call a pretty average shoe with some minor flaws and poor dusty floor traction performance.
7,301,7.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-06-12,The horrible blisters made me not want to hoop in the Curry 5.
1,301,7.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-04-17,"The Curry 5 is simply not a shoe I can recommend. Traction is very inconsistent, and the fit is horrendous."
24,301,7.4,RicheeKim,2018-04-24,The Curry 5 is the worst Curry model I have played in. Stay away from this shoe if you don't have narrow feet!
25,301,7.0,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2018-04-17,I am really confused how this shoe got by the initial testing phase. The fit of the Curry 5 is way too specific and doesn't work for me at all.
19,301,7.0,PureKicks,2018-07-16,"Materials and fit are fantastic, the traction is pretty good, but the support and cushioning are a letdown."
11,301,6.6,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-04-17,I cannot recommend the Curry 5 to a player of any position or size.
6,302,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2018-05-04,This is a top-tier performer for a very affordable price. This is going to be on the list of shoes with the best traction!
11,302,8.5,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-04-17,Very good traction and perhaps the best Boost cushioning in a basketball sneaker. Make sure to go down half a size because the fit didn't work for me in my true size.
7,302,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-04-17,"Insane traction, responsive cushioning and a very affordable price. I actually prefer the Crazylight Boost over the more expensive Adidas Harden 2."
3,302,8.2,Schwollo,2018-08-08,It's almost as if Adidas read my blog and fixed all the issues I had with the predecessor. Great shoe that almost any player will enjoy - especially at the affordable price!
24,302,7.5,RicheeKim,2018-04-17,"Amazing cushioning, good traction and solid materials -  this could have been a 9.0! But dead space in the toebox and excessive heel slippage killed the Crazy Light Boost 2018 for me."
11,303,9.5,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-04-17,"It may be an opinion clouded in sentiment, but there is no denying it: the Protro is a great, great, great performer."
1,303,9.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-04-26,I miss shoes that are built like this. Nike reduced a bit of bulk from the original and created a shoe that I didn't want to take off again.
24,303,9.0,RicheeKim,2018-10-01,"At $175, I wouldn't really recommend the Kobe Protro for on-court use. This is a great performer, but there are cheaper shoes that perform just as well. If you are a big Kobe fan or you like the old school materials, then go ahead and buy these!"
3,303,8.8,Schwollo,2018-08-08,The Kobe 1 Protro feels and plays like the OG which is a good thing! From traction to containment and balanced cushioning - it does everything right and gets a first-team rating from me!
25,303,8.5,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2018-04-30,"At the end of the day, the Kobe 1 Protro still feels like a throwback sneaker. The materials feel heavy and restrictive compared to current basketball shoe models."
6,303,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2018-04-30,"The Kobe 1 Protro is a decent big-man shoe. But for me, it was way too clunky and heavy. I feel like this is more of a lifestyle sneaker."
15,304,9.5,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2018-04-30,"Overall, the Kobe NXT 360 is the best Kobe shoe since the Kobe 9, in my opinion."
6,304,9.4,The Sole Brothers,2018-04-25,There is no other shoe I want to play in as much as these. Even though the traction of the translucent rubber is not the best this still might be the best basketball shoe we ever played in.
24,304,9.2,RicheeKim,2018-07-16,The Kobe AD NXT 360 is a great performer and looks amazing!
19,304,8.8,PureKicks,2018-09-26,This is officially PureKicks best-rated shoe so far!
1,304,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-06-16,The Kobe NXT 360 is a true next-generation shoe and incredibly fun to play in!
7,304,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-04-24,"The traction is subpar, the 360 Flyknit concept is cool but nothing spectacular and the price is too expensive for what you get."
25,304,8.4,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2018-06-12,I absolutely loved playing in these shoes! The Kobe AD NXT 360 truly feels like a high-performance shoe with cutting-edge technology and will be in my rotation for a long time.
3,304,8.4,Schwollo,2018-07-16,"So is the NXT 360 worth the price of admission? In a nutshell, no. The Mamba Instinct delivers similar performance, at a fraction of the price!"
6,305,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2018-06-12,The Lebron Soldier 12 is 100% worth its price! It's just nice to play in a shoe with gnarly traction like this!
3,305,8.6,Schwollo,2018-09-26,"If you want a shoe that does everything very well, this is your shoe."
19,305,7.4,PureKicks,2018-06-12,"The traction was surprisingly fantastic! The fit was brillitant, the support was good, if only the materials would have been better!"
6,306,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2018-03-25,This is by far the cheapest signature model on the market but it's still a very good performer. We enjoyed it a lot!
7,306,7.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-04-24,"Considering that the Kyrie Flytrap is a budget model it gets the job done, but it's nothing spectacular. Save some extra money and get the Kyrie 4."
1,306,7.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-04-17,"Not a bad shoe for $80, but I would opt for discounted Kyrie 4s � unless you happen to have a wide foot."
4,306,6.8,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2018-03-25,I can't recommend the Kyrie Flytrap from a performance standpoint. The Flytrap feels so cheap that it doesn�t even feel like it was made by Nike.
15,306,6.7,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2018-03-25,Is it worth your $80 bucks? I don�t think so.
1,307,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-04-25,The Lebron 15 Low fixes the issues of the mid version with stability and support on lateral movements. This is a shoe that will for everyone.
11,307,8.7,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-06-12,The Lebron 15 Low is a vast improvement over last year's Lows. It's a little more guard-oriented with less cushioning and better stability and traction during lateral cuts. It also works well for lighter players that didn't like the bulky High-top version of the Lebron 15.
6,307,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2018-04-25,"I am not a big fan of the Lebron 15 Low. Expensive, heavier than most Lows and the high ride won't work for quick guards who rely on lateral cuts."
1,308,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-02-26,The PG 2 is a really fun shoe to play because it enhanced nearly every feature found on the PG 1.
7,308,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-03-04,"The PG2 has slightly improved in every aspect: better cushioning, nicer materials, more comfortable fit and slightly improved traction make them a contender for best shoe of 2018."
15,308,9.0,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2018-03-25,The Nike PG 2 is a well-rounded shoe and great for people all shapes and sizes. I�d say its definitely an upgrade from the PG 1.
11,308,9.0,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-03-25,The PG2 is honestly the best all-around shoe that Nike has on the market right now (especially at $110).
24,308,8.6,RicheeKim,2018-02-26,The PG2 performs well across all aspects and comes at an extremely fair price.
25,308,8.6,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2018-03-25,The Nike PG2 is a slight improvement over the PG1 and in the competition for the best bang-for-the-buck basketball shoe on the market.
3,308,8.4,Schwollo,2018-03-25,"The Nike PG2 is all any player would need, everything about it is solid."
4,308,8.3,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2018-08-08,"Lockdown and fit have been greatly improved, the cushioning offers exceptional response after a break-in period and $110 remains a great deal! Unfortunately, the shoe still isn't the most comfortable and traction has taken a small step backward."
6,308,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2018-03-04,"At this price point, you will have a hard time finding another shoe of this quality."
19,308,8.0,PureKicks,2018-03-25,This shoe is an absolute steal! I especially loved the incredible fit and traction.
6,309,9.2,The Sole Brothers,2018-03-04,We really enjoyed playing in these. The Harden Vol. 2 should work well for everyone - responsive enough for guards but the support and comfortable cushioning will work well for bigger guys too!
1,309,8.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-03-04,"Overall a great shoe, but unfortunately, the inconsistency that I experienced with the traction will likely keep the Harden Vol 2 out of my rotation."
3,309,8.8,Schwollo,2018-03-04,The Harden Vol2 is extremely fun to wear! Overall I feel that Adidas improved everything compared to the V1.
15,309,8.7,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2018-03-04,Unless you play on crispy clean courts I wouldn't recommend the Harden Vol 2 because there are a bunch of better options on the market.
25,309,8.6,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2018-06-12,The Harden 2 will defintely stay in my gym bag for a while! I especially loved the comfortable materials and the Boost cushioning. Everything about this sneaker just worked for me - and they are just flat out fun to play in!
24,309,8.5,RicheeKim,2018-02-26,Overall the Harden Vol. 2 is a great performer. Some nitpicking: I would have liked the heel to be a little less clunky and the Boost cushioning to be a little softer in the forefoot.
7,309,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-03-25,"Overall, this shoe is pretty good. Great shoe if you have bad knees, you need a lot of comfort and impact protection and you can live with the lackluster traction."
19,309,7.8,PureKicks,2018-02-26,"Amazing cushioning, very nice materials and support. Traction is solid but I wasn't happy with the fit."
6,310,9.8,The Sole Brothers,2018-11-26,I really like everything about the Adidas Crazy BYW X. The performance is great and should work well for players of all positions.
1,310,8.7,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-11-26,"I think the Crazy BYW X is very good, but the traction definitely could be better."
25,310,7.8,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2018-11-26,"Overall, the performance of the Adidas BYW X is solid. But the uneven ride and the lacking outsole durability are no-gos considering the hefty price tag."
6,311,9.4,The Sole Brothers,2018-01-23,The full-length zoom setup is worth the $125 alone. A great big-man shoe as the cushion is amazing!
15,311,9.4,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2018-01-29,"I didn�t expect the shoe to perform this well, but damn! Solid traction, great cushioning, great fit and lockdown, support was on point."
1,311,9.3,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-01-29,"What a fantastic shoe this is. I�m not a fan of Russell Westbrook, but man, do I love playing in his shoe."
11,311,9.1,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-01-24,"If you are looking for great fit and support, great cushioning, and (almost) great traction, you have got to check this shoe out!"
7,311,8.8,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-01-23,"To me, this will be one of the top performance sneakers of 2018. Full-length zoom at $125 - you can't beat that!"
3,311,8.6,Schwollo,2018-02-26,The Why Not Zero.1 is a very nice start for Westbrook�s signature line from a performance standpoint.
20,311,8.1,Analykix.com,2018-10-08,"I really enjoyed the full-length cushioning, and the support and lockdown. Overall, I'd wish this shoe was a little less bulky."
24,311,8.0,RicheeKim,2018-01-21,"The cushion is great, but the lacking traction and the uncomfortable strap hold back what could have been a top performer.  I am a bit disappointed by Russel Westbrooks first signature sneaker."
19,311,7.2,PureKicks,2018-03-25,"The Why Not Zero.1 is a good first edition of Russell Westbrooks signature line. Full-length Zoom is very nice, but materials could be a lot more comfortable."
24,312,9.1,RicheeKim,2017-12-29,"At $120, the Kyrie 4 is an absolute steal! This is a very well constructed shoe and an absolute beast on the court. Probably my favorite shoe to play in right now!"
1,312,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Overall, the Nike Kyrie 4 is Nike�s best performer this year. There�s just enough cushion for most, solid traction, fantastic fit and adequate support � and all of comes at a �team� friendly price point of $120."
15,312,9.0,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2018-01-14,The Kyrie 4 is the best Kyrie to date. This shoe has everything and is Nike�s best all-around hooping kick right now.
19,312,9.0,PureKicks,2018-01-21,This is the best Kyrie signature shoe ever. The traction is amazing and the cushion and materials are vastly improved.
2,312,9.0,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2018-02-26,The Kyrie 4 is one of Nike�s best-performing signature shoes that works well at all positions.
6,312,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2018-01-05,"The Kyrie 4 is a phenomenal addition to the Kyrie line. It comes with improved cushioning and materials, great fit and support. The traction is a little disappointing, but for $120 these are a great pickup!"
7,312,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,Definitely the best shoe in the Kyrie signature line so far. Perfect for quick guards who don't rely a lot on impact protection.
25,312,8.4,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2017-01-01,"I had a lot of fun in the Kyrie 4! I give them a B+ - it's not quite elite, but almost there. However, at a $120 price these offer great value!"
3,312,8.4,Schwollo,2018-01-05,"All in all, the Kyrie 4 is a solid shoe that does everything fairly well, while doing nothing outstanding or really poorly. Cushioning has improved, the traction is decent overall and I really liked the comfort of the plush interior."
9,312,8.3,KickGenius,2018-01-29,"Overall, I am satisfied with the Kyrie 4. Minimal break-in time, great traction and a fair price. The Kyrie 4 gets the job done!"
15,313,9.0,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2017-12-27,"The Way of Wade 6 is a solid performer, and I enjoy this shoe a lot. I find myself going to this sneaker just about much as I go to my Dame 4s."
7,313,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-02-26,"Materials and cushion are great, support and traction are solid. With a few tweaks this could have been the sneaker of the year!"
1,313,8.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-01-14,The Way of Wade 6 competes with most of the top-tier shoes offered from other brands.
6,313,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2017-12-27,"Very comfortable, really nice traction - I love the performance of these. The only downside is the lateral containment and the excessive toe room."
6,314,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2018-01-14,The Kyrie S1 perform pretty similar to the Kyrie 1 but feels a little bit bulkier.
19,314,8.5,PureKicks,2017-12-29,This is a really nice concoction of the first three Kyrie models.
1,314,8.3,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-01-14,I was surprised with how much I enjoyed the shoe on-court.
6,315,9.6,The Sole Brothers,2018-01-14,"I love how light and minimal the Curry 4 Low feels. Traction and cushion remained unchanged from the High-Top, but materials and fit are much improved."
24,315,8.9,RicheeKim,2018-01-14,I think the Curry 4 Low is an upgrade to the original version and I really love to play in them.
1,315,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-01-14,The Curry 4 Low offers great traction and stability for low-to-the-ground guards that prefer to be quick on their feet.
7,315,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2018-01-21,Better materials and fit compared to the Highs. But the same lackluster cushioning prevents these shoes from being a top performer.
3,315,7.8,Schwollo,2018-01-21,"On the court, the Curry 4 Low doesn�t really do anything better than the mid, plus I had some heel slip."
6,316,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"The Curry 4 feels super-duper responsive. As one of the lightest shoes on the market, it provides great traction, tight fit, and low-to-the-ground feeling which makes it the perfect shoe for quick guards."
24,316,8.9,RicheeKim,2017-01-01,"The Curry 4 is a great shoe for guards that rely on quick, responsive movements. I really liked everything about it except the very minimal impact protection."
11,316,8.8,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Curry 4 is a great shoe for quick, ball-handling point guards who need speed with no lag."
15,316,8.7,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,The Under Armour Curry 4 is a fantastic shoe for anyone looking for court feel. For the people who want impact protection I�d say stay clear from the Curry 4.
1,316,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Curry 4 feels like it should have come after the Curry 2. It provides a better fit, greater stability, and more control."
7,316,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"I have mixed feelings about the Curry 4. Traction is a strong point, materials are 50:50, support and cushion are decent. However, I can't help to be a little disappointed."
9,316,8.5,KickGenius,2017-12-29,These get the job done - especially if you are looking for a shoe that is really supportive.
19,316,8.5,PureKicks,2018-01-14,"This is the best Curry signature shoe so far. Great traction, good cushioning and support - perfect for quick guards."
3,316,8.2,Schwollo,2017-12-27,"The Curry 4 is for the quick guard who likes a low to the ground ride with responsive cushioning, tight traction, stability and containment for quick cuts and movements."
25,316,7.8,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2017-12-27,"Overall, I am a little disappointed by the Curry 4, mainly due to the very firm cushioning and budget material."
6,317,9.4,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"One of the best performance shoes I have played in this year, especially at this price. A very nice shoe that will work for every type of player."
1,317,9.1,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Anta KT3 is a great shoe. Between the Dame 4, Curry 4 and KT3 I have one hell of a lineup to choose from on any given night."
25,317,8.6,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2017-12-27,"I think Anta killed it with the KT3. This is a very affordable signature sneaker with a premium knitted upper, great traction and responsive cushioning."
7,317,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,Premium materials as well as improved cushioning and traction - a definitive improvement over the KT2.
20,317,8.5,Analykix.com,2018-04-17,I enjoyed playing in the Anta KT3 and I would easily recommend the shoe for multiple player positions because of it's adequate cushioning.
2,318,9.3,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2018-01-05,"The LeBron 15 is one of the best LeBron shoes ever. Materials, fit, and cushion are the definite highlights of the shoe."
24,318,9.2,RicheeKim,2017-01-01,"I think this is one of the best Lebrons ever. Material usage is great, cushioning is great, support is great -  basically, everthing is really nice! But keep in mind that this shoe is made for big and heavy players, and won't work as well for smaller guards."
15,318,9.0,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Overall, the LeBron 15 is a fun shoe to play in. Especially, the cushion is fabulous!"
19,318,9.0,PureKicks,2017-01-01,"The Lebron 15 is the best Lebron of all time. This shoe ticks all the boxes, the only slight downside was the traction."
11,318,8.9,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2018-01-21,"This may be the best playing LeBron shoe ever. If you are looking for the absolute best Nike cushioning in basketball and a shoe that bleeds technology, the LeBron 15 is your ride."
1,318,8.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"I love pieces of the LeBron 15. Materials and fit are highlights, and the cushion is the best Nike has offered in years. Stability made them a bit concerning for me while on the floor and I never ended up feeling as comfortable as I wanted to be."
6,318,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"My favorite Lebron ever - I really enjoyed playing in the Lebron 15. The cushioning is insane, the materials are as premium as it gets, unfortunately, the price is too."
3,318,8.6,Schwollo,2017-01-01,"There are a lot of positives with the LBJ 15 especially the cushioning, the fit, and the soft materials. Traction isn�t horrible but it definitely isn�t King worthy and needs some serious break in and wear to improve."
4,318,8.5,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2017-01-01,"The LeBron 15 doesn�t offer anything truly groundbreaking in terms of its design, but it�s taken existing concepts and improved on nearly everything. The traction was the only real downer for me, but it wasn�t bad enough to ruin the things I did like."
7,318,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"As a small guard, I didn't love the high-off-the-ground feeling and the laggy cushioning. However, if you are a bigger, heavier and powerful player than you will love the Lebron 15."
1,319,9.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,The Air Jordan 32 is a huge step in the right direction. Everything feels refined. If Jordan Brand can keep the stability but increase the flexibility then it will have perfected the Flight Speed setup. I think people are going to like this one.
15,319,9.2,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Air Jordan XXXII is a banger for real. This shoe has everything you need: good traction, good cushion, excellent materials, and amazing support."
2,319,9.2,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2017-12-27,"This is hands down the best on-court Air Jordan Model to date, as it should be. Every feature fits the mold to near perfection. Jordan Brand took a huge step in the right direction across all performance aspects."
3,319,9.0,Schwollo,2017-01-01,"The AJ XXXII is a great shoe that should satisfy everyone except the minimalist hoop crowd that love shoes like the Kobe 8, Mamba Mentality, Instinct etc"
24,319,9.0,RicheeKim,2017-12-27,"Across the spectrum, this shoe performs very well and should work for all types of players. Pretty pricey, but worth every penny!"
25,319,8.8,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2017-12-27,The Air Jordan 32 is a great performer and I was a little sad when I had to put these aside to test other performance shoes. The only two downsides are the long break-in period and the hefty price tag.
4,319,8.8,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2017-01-01,"Despite sky-high expectations, the Air Jordan 32 mostly delivers. I liked the more minimal collar and feel of the 31s cushioning better, but thought the 32 offered far superior traction and a smoother transition."
9,319,8.7,KickGenius,2018-01-14,I think this is a great shoe for in-between players who are looking for a good mix of comfortable cushioning and responsiveness.
10,319,8.6,MR FOAMER SIMPSON,2017-01-01,"I think Jordan brand did a great job with the XXXII. This has taken over the Nike PG1 as my go-to basketball shoes.  Traction, cushioning and lockdown are all great - what else do you need in a performance sneaker?"
7,319,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"Pros: Great Traction, Cushioning provides a good balance between impact protection and res"
19,319,8.5,PureKicks,2017-12-27,"Overall, I would describe the Air Jordan 32 as a responsive shoe with ultimate support. Great for big guys, but unfortunately, the traction was pretty disappointing."
6,319,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,Nice shoes with premium materials and nice cushioning. I was a bit disappointed by the traction and the lateral containment. At a steep $185 I wouldn't recommend these.
1,320,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,The Dame line continues to be the best signature you can get for your money. Bang for your buck like no other.
7,320,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,This is a really good performance basketball shoe - probably one of the best basketball shoes of 2017! Especially at the low list price of $115.
15,320,9.0,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,I was having so much fun in this kick I didn�t want to stop. If there was a category for �fun to play in� I would rate the Dame 4 Hall of Fame!
11,320,9.0,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"With good cushioning, good fit, and good materials, the Dame 4 is good at everything. As an overall package, this is one of the most complete and fun shoes to play in that you will ever find."
2,320,9.0,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2017-12-29,"Decent cushion, good fit, good materials � the shoe is good for everything on the court and gives you a great overall package."
6,320,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,I loved playing in these. Perfect for guards who want to be low to the ground and are looking for a very responsive shoe.
24,320,8.8,RicheeKim,2017-01-01,The Dame 4 is the perfect shoe for quick guards and offers amazing performance at a very affordable price.
3,320,8.6,Schwollo,2017-01-01,I really really really enjoy playing in this shoe but only on clean or slightly dusty floors. But the fact that I would even consider playing in these despite the meh traction speaks volumes about how fun this shoe is overall.
19,320,8.6,PureKicks,2017-12-27,The Dame 4 is an underrated shoe that works very well for quick guards.
9,320,8.5,KickGenius,2017-01-01,This is probably the best performing shoe to hoop in right now! This shoe is really smooth and I come back to it all the time.
25,320,8.5,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2017-12-27,"Traction, cushion, fit were all great, and the support system is all I need. This is one of the best-value sneakers I have ever worn!"
1,321,9.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2018-01-24,The Air Jordan 32 is a huge step in the right direction.
24,321,9.0,RicheeKim,2017-12-27,I think this shoe is worth every penny and I like the low-top version better than the regular mid. The Air Jordan 32 Low offers slightly better traction and more freedom of movement.
19,321,8.8,PureKicks,2017-12-27,"You get amazing cushioning, and premium materials. Unfortunately, the traction is a real dust collector. Decent performer, but probably not worth the hefty price tag"
6,321,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2017-12-27,I really enjoyed playing in these! The Air Jordan 32 Low is super comfortable and performs very well.
6,322,9.2,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"The performance of the D Rose 8 is stellar. Feels like a lighter, streamlined and more minimal D Rose 7. I love these shoes and put them on the top of my list of Adidas performance sneakers."
11,322,9.0,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"By combining great traction, awesome cushioning, and serious fit, the Rose 8 is built for every player."
24,322,8.9,RicheeKim,2017-01-01,"For $140 this is a really good shoe. It brings everything you want: impact protection, responsiveness, ventilation, support and really good traction. If you like supportive high-tops, then this is the perfect shoe for you!"
1,322,8.9,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-12-27,"The Adidas D Rose 8 is a very solid shoe. Traction is my main gripe with the Rose 8, but everything from the midsole up worked really well."
3,322,8.6,Schwollo,2017-01-01,"Since the D Rose 5, we�ve gotten great cushioning, traction, support and stability, and a reliable fit year over year and the D Rose 8 is no different. Materials aren�t always the best but that�s always been a non-issue for me."
19,322,8.6,PureKicks,2017-12-27,No distractions! This is a traditional basketball shoe and a great overall performer. This shoe worked very well for my style of game!
6,323,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,You feel super fast in these shoes. The Hyperdunk 2017 is one of the top performers of 2017
9,323,9.0,KickGenius,2017-12-27,I am a big fan of the comfort and amazing traction of the FlyKnit version of the Hyperdunk 2017.
24,323,8.7,RicheeKim,2017-12-27,"Overall, I can highly recommend this shoe for players of every position. Me, as a guard, I love this shoe as I get decent impact protection and a great court feel!"
2,323,8.6,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,The Nike React Hyperdunk 2017 is by far one of the most solid shoes I�ve played in this year
3,323,8.6,Schwollo,2017-01-01,"HD2017 has taken the top Hyperdunk spot. Better traction than previous Hyperdunks, better cushioning than the 2012-14 version, great fit, good stability and excellent containment� what more do you want?"
7,323,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"Overall, this is a really good shoe. Good traction, nice material and solid lockdown. Support could have been a little better. At $160 it is a little expensive."
19,323,8.5,PureKicks,2017-12-27,"Amazing traction, good support and the addition of React cushioning is welcome. I like shoes you can just put on, and they don't get in the way."
15,323,8.0,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Nike Hyperdunk 2017 Flyknit isn�t a bad shoe. The cushion isn�t what I expected, but it�s tolerable. The lateral containment wasn�t the best, but it won�t keep me from hooping in these again."
4,323,8.0,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2017-01-01,I�d say the React Hyperdunk was disappointing. It is a hard shoe to recommend when better options are available at all price points.
9,324,9.0,KickGenius,2017-12-27,I think the Kobe AD Mid is the best Kobe shoe out right now! Better than the NXT or the regular AD.
7,324,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"Overall, the Kobe AD Mid is a solid performer with phenomenal traction, nice cushioning and solid support. The suede material is a little too stiff for my liking, but hopefully, future releases with a Jacquard or Flyknit upper will fix this issue."
24,324,8.9,RicheeKim,2017-12-27,The Kobe AD is an amazing performer but I just wish they had used a different upper material.
3,324,8.6,Schwollo,2017-12-27,"I think the Kobe AD Mid is an excellent all-around performer on the court. Not surprisingly, it�s one of my top five for the year due to its great overall performance."
19,324,8.5,PureKicks,2017-12-27,"The Kobe AD Mid is a beautiful and comfortable shoe that unfortunately suffers from bad ventilation and a small amount of heel slippage. Otherwise, I really like this shoe!"
6,324,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"This shoe feels very different than any other Kobe shoe I ever played in. It provides less responsiveness and court feel than other Kobes. It seems like after his retirement, Kobe wants a little more cushioning and a more ""old school"" vibe from his shoes."
25,324,8.2,JAHRONMON [Youtube],2017-12-27,"This is a very well performing shoe but there are no standout features. Great pickup for Kobe fans, but there are cheaper shoes that perform just as well."
1,324,7.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,The shoe plays and performs really well. Traction was awesome and the cushion was solid � especially for guards. Ventilation and material quality are where the Kobe AD Mid�s could improve.
15,324,7.8,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,The Kobe AD Mid is a beautiful shoe. The only real complaint I have is with the lacing system digging into my foot.
6,325,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"A budget model that performs like a top-tier model. Traction is amazing, the cushion is okay, materials are really nice and they fit me very well. I think this is one of the best-performing Under Armour shoes out right now!"
18,325,8.5,AnotherPair [Youtube],2017-01-01,"Overall, this is a great shoe that will work for every type of player. Good job Under Armour!"
11,325,8.0,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Overall, the Drive 4 is a decent, serviceable shoe � nothing except traction really stands out, yet the shoe is good for players at all positions."
2,325,8.0,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"This shoe is for the every day, every position player and it is a solid performer. If you require more cushion like myself, then you may have to look elsewhere."
7,325,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"The Under Armour Drive 4 is a solid hoops shoe for a low-budget price. I like them more than the Steph Curry 3 Zero. They feel lighter, are more flexible and the traction is on point. The cushioning is not a strong point but is still fairly good."
5,325,7.8,Jarron Ramos [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Drive 4 has some things going for it (traction) and then there are some things that need work (fit and materials). If you�re someone who plays low to the ground, prefers a stable ride and has a wide foot, these are going to be great for you."
1,326,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Outside of the lacking cushioning the Jordan Super.Fly 2017 is so close to being perfect it�s kind of scary,"
2,326,8.6,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Jordan Super.Fly 2017 was an absolute delight to ball in.  If you�re okay with the firmness of React cushioning and enjoy a low profile on-court ride, this has you covered with traction, lockdown, and stability."
6,326,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"It's a good performer made for bigger dudes. Very durable because of the strong materials and hard rubber. However, I wouldn't recommend them for a shifty guard."
24,326,8.4,RicheeKim,2017-12-27,"The Super.Fly 2017 is a decent shoe, but I would rather go with the Nike Hyperdunk 2017 as it comes with the same technology but more premium materials and better-feeling cushioning."
19,326,8.0,PureKicks,2017-01-01,"Some things are good, some aren't. This shoe doesn't quite get my approval."
6,327,9.4,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"Crazy good performance, looks dope, premium materials. Overall, an amazing shoe, get it!"
15,327,9.2,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,The adidas Crazy Explosive 2017 Primeknit is a great shoe! I love this thing like crazy and it is by far my favorite hoop shoe of 2017 so far. It�s number one in my rotation and I�m pretty sure it will be in many of yours as well.
11,327,9.2,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Improved fit and killer cushioning should put the Crazy Explosive 2017 PK on everyone�s radar this year if you play basketball. Grab this shoe if you need traction for indoor courts, #Boostislife cushioning, a locked-in fit, and quick support."
9,327,9.0,KickGenius,2017-01-01,Feels like playing in a sock with good traction and Boost cushioning!
24,327,9.0,RicheeKim,2017-12-27,Great shoe! If you can - get the solid rubber version as it offers slightly improved traction.
19,327,9.0,PureKicks,2017-12-27,"I am really happy with the Crazy Explosive 2017. Crazy comfortable, great cushioning and traction."
3,327,8.8,Schwollo,2017-01-01,I think most players will enjoy the Crazy Explosive 2017 because it does everything well if not great and really gives the player an excellent one to one fit with a low to ground yet well cushioned ride.
7,327,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"I prefer the 2016 version over the Crazy Explosive 2017. The traction is identical, cushioning is a lot firmer and less plush, lockdown and support are a little better and the materials are a lot stiffer and less comfortable. Overall, still a very solid shoe."
6,328,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2017-12-27,This shoe is pretty nice and works well for guards who need a responsive shoe. Feels a little like a low-top Kyrie 2 with nicer materials and worse traction.
9,328,8.0,KickGenius,2017-12-27,Overall this is a solid shoe that has signature model-like qualities at a retail price of $100 - you can't really beat that!
19,328,8.0,PureKicks,2017-12-27,"Overall, this is a pretty good shoe. Nothing crazy, but very good value for the money!"
15,328,7.4,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2017-12-27,"While the Nike Zoom Shift is aesthetically pleasing, the inconsistent traction and the brick-like cushion makes the shoe very unpleasant on-court."
15,329,9.3,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Overall, the Nike Lebron Soldier 11 is the bomb, I love it! I have no complaints about it whatsoever. This shoe jumped up to #2 on my rotation, that's how much I liked it."
1,329,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"While traction could still use a little bit of work, the cushion is immensely better than the last go-around. Suitable for every position on the floor and a great option for players than want a little bit of everything with their on-court shoes."
6,329,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"A well-rounded shoe that provides a ton of support and lockdown. Traction is decent. Not recommended for shifty guards because it feels a little bulky, but a very good shoe for bigger players who value impact protection, lockdown and support."
3,329,8.6,Schwollo,2017-12-27,"Although the Soldier XI doesn�t do anything extremely well, it�s a very solid shoe all the way around."
4,329,8.5,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2017-01-01,"The LeBron Soldier 11 in many ways is �just� the LeBron Soldier 10.1. That�s really not a bad thing though, as the Soldier 10 was a great shoe, and the 11 improves on almost every aspect of its design with very minimal compromise."
9,329,8.5,KickGenius,2017-01-01,"Good for what it does, doesn't quite get the Kick Genius stamp of approval but definitely gets the job done. The best Lebron Soldier I ever played in for sure."
5,329,8.2,Jarron Ramos [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Nike LeBron Soldier 11 is a very versatile sneaker. Any guard or slashing forward will find something that they like. It is a solid option both indoors and on the black top, yet it isn�t quite �elite.� Had Nike went all out on the cushioning and made it a little more stable, it would have easily been a top-tier performer."
7,329,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"It's a really, really solid shoe. I loved the cushioning and responsiveness, the support and lockdown were really solid, but traction was very inconsistent. Not my go-to shoes but definitely in the rotation."
7,330,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"Overall the shoe is very similar to the KD 9. I like the firmer cushioning, the soft and flexible upper, but the support could be better."
19,330,8.6,PureKicks,2017-12-27,The KD10 is a great shoe overall but there are some downfalls like the lacking of lateral support.
6,330,8.5,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,I like the shoe a lot! If you are not looking to do heavy lateral cuts or be really shifty then this is a great shoe! Very comfortable fit and great cushion make these perfect when you want to give your legs some extra comfort.
11,330,8.4,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Compared to the KD9, the Zoom is toned down, for good and bad. The materials are definitely improved. The looks � let�s face it, this is a beautiful shoe. But the traction slid a little and the overall playability seemed a step back from the KD9."
2,330,8.4,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,The KD10 just misses being a great shoe due to minor flaws in construction and traction � but they don�t deter it from being a good performance shoe.
15,330,8.3,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2017-12-27,"Overall, the KD10 is a decent shoe, it just not as good as the KD9."
24,330,8.1,RicheeKim,2017-12-27,"Overall, this is a good shoe. Unfortunately, traction and support keep it from being great."
1,330,8.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Nike KD 9 was an amazing shoe. The Nike KD 10 was almost an amazing shoe. It looks amazing, but it suffered in a few areas due to the bold new design."
9,330,8.0,KickGenius,2017-01-01,Overall the KD 10 performs solid in all categories. There is nothing phenomenal but on the flip side there is also nothing bad.
1,331,9.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Is the Curry 3ZER0 leaps and bounds better than the Curry 3? No. However, the cushion feels more refined and offers a better balance between stability and protection.  If you�re a guard or a shooter and plan on trying out the Curry 3ZER0 I think you�ll be pleasantly surprised."
3,331,8.6,Schwollo,2017-01-01,"Out of the three Curry models released this year, I�d put the Low first, the 3Zero slightly behind at second and then the Mid. The Curry 3 Zero is a more minimal shoe that doesn't rely on bells and whistles or tech mumbo-jumbo, which I personally enjoy."
24,331,8.5,RicheeKim,2017-01-01,For a $120 this is not a bad shoe! Really good on-court performer and I like the fit much better compared to the original Curry 3. I just wish they hadn't downgraded the material from Threadborne to Mesh.
7,331,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"The SC 3Zero is a solid second line shoe. Overall, I wasn't a big fan of the new cushioning setup and the inconsistent traction. However, I did like the improved ankle support."
6,331,7.8,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"Just like the Curry 3, nothing special. I wasn't happy with the fit and the traction. Let's hope for an improved Curry 4."
1,332,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The ANTA KT Outdoor 2 Low is a very good hoop shoe that offers a little bit of everything � court feel, semi-plush cushioning, durable traction that works on a variety of surfaces, and materials that are very much in line with what other brands are offering."
20,332,8.3,Analykix.com,2017-01-01,"The Anta KT Outdoor 2 Low is a solid shoe. It's very light, has good impact protection and superb traction. I highly recommend this shoe for hoopers who love to play in both indoor and outdoor courts."
6,332,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"I was really impressed with this shoes, especially at $80! This will be my go-to outdoor shoe."
9,333,9.3,KickGenius,2017-01-01,"I think this is a very good shoe. Great traction, nice materials and an outstanding fit (for narrow feet). This is a BIG upgrade over the original Kobe AD"
1,333,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,The NXT version of the Kobe A.D. has much more in common with the Kobe 11 than with the ori
3,333,8.8,Schwollo,2017-01-01,"It is just a well-rounded performer with great traction, fun cushioning, excellent fit and stability and decent containment. These edge out the Curry 3 Low for my favorite of 2017."
6,333,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"For $200 this shoe is a no-go. Disregarding the price, the Kobe AD NXT is a really good performer."
4,333,8.8,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2017-01-01,"The Kobe AD NXT has some exciting high points and I truly enjoyed playing in these thanks to the fantastic upper comfort. Unfortunately, at $200 this is the most expensive basketball shoe model in the 2017 Nike lineup. There are far better values out there."
10,333,8.3,MR FOAMER SIMPSON,2017-01-01,User didn't add a summary.
7,334,9.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,At $110 these are by far the best value performance basketball shoes available right now.
5,334,8.8,Jarron Ramos [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Nike PG 1 features a consistent traction experience that holds up on a wide variety of court conditions as well as a decent cushion setup that favors quick, low to the ground players. At $110, it�s worth a shot right?"
9,334,8.7,KickGenius,2017-01-01,Overall I thought that shoe performed great! It's my go-to shoe right now and I will be hooping in them for a while!
24,334,8.6,RicheeKim,2017-12-27,"For $110, I can absolutely recommend these shoes."
4,334,8.5,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2017-01-01,"The PG1 performs on a level that far exceeds its relatively low price tag.  Its cushioning and stability are top-notch, making it my favorite Nike of the season at any price."
1,334,8.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,I will say that the Nike PG1 is very good if you�re looking for a shoe that feels like an extension of your foot without breaking the bank.
2,334,8.4,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The PG1 is a wonderful shoe to play in, as long as you don�t have wide feet and you can get your foot into the shoe. For a first signature model and it�s $110 price point, I think the shoe is fantastic."
6,334,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,I really like to play in the Nike PG1. Cushion and fit are nice and the traction gets good after breaking them in.  At $110 they are a real steal!
10,334,8.3,MR FOAMER SIMPSON,2017-01-01,"For only $110 it  is a very, very good performance basketball sneaker.  You won't worry about sliding around, slipping on the floor, or the lockdown of the shoe. A"
3,334,8.0,Schwollo,2017-01-01,"Overall, the PG1 is a great start to a new signature shoe, far better than the Kyrie 1 in my opinion. Cushioning isn�t the best or very fun but it works fine while  the rest of the shoe performs very well."
7,335,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"When it comes to performance the KD9 Elite is very similar to the original KD9. The most notable difference is the strong lacing cables which slightly enhance support and lockdown. However, this new lacing setup also makes the shoe even narrower which led to some pain on the side of my feet."
9,335,8.8,KickGenius,2017-01-01,A great shoe with slight improvements over the original KD9. The upper material is softer and more comfortable and the new lacing system provides more lockdown and support.
6,335,8.5,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,It's a very specific shoe. Great if you have narrow feet and you are looking for a shoe with a lot of cushion and impact protection. If you are a shifty guard who does a lot of crossovers and cuts then the lacking support of the upper and the slightly unstable platform are not ideal. Not recommended if you have wide feet.
5,335,7.8,Jarron Ramos [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The traction, cushion, and materials all bring out the best of Nike�s technology, unfortunately, the KD 9 Elite doesn't perform as well when it comes to support and fit."
15,336,8.8,Another Pair [weartesters.com],2017-12-27,"At a retail price of $120, the Jordan Ultra Fly offers great bang for the buck."
1,336,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-12-27,This is the first Jordan Brand performance model I�ve bought in a long time that doesn�t make me feel like I was ripped off.
9,336,8.5,KickGenius,2017-12-27,"For $125 this is a great performer. I don't feel like the Ultra Fly series gets enough respect. Heel and forefoot Zoom, mesh upper, nice traction - I can't ask for much more."
11,337,8.2,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Charged Controller is quick, low-riding, well-cushioned but not super soft, with a locked-in fit just stable enough to make me feel bulletproof."
2,337,8.2,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Under Armour Charged Controller is a fantastic shoe. It rides low, is responsive, locks you in and keeps you stable to do battle on the hardwood."
5,337,7.8,Jarron Ramos [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"When you take price out of the equation and put the Charged Controller up against some of the top-tier performers on the market today, it doesn�t quite belong in that group. But right below it? Absolutely. Oh, and did we mentioned that the shoe is only $100?"
7,337,7.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"Overall, a solid shoe. Nothing super spectacular, but also no deal breakers. I wasn't happy with the traction and the cushioning wore out pretty quickly."
6,337,6.1,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"Even at a $100 bucks, we don't recommend this shoe. There are many other shoes out there that provide far better value."
6,338,8.0,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"I didn't like the Melo M13. As a guard, don't get these! The cushioning and the materials are good, but the traction was a dealbreaker for me."
11,338,7.0,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Nice try, but not quite. Felled by traction and support, the Melo M13 had potential."
7,339,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"An improvement over the last year, but I didn't like the clunkiness of the transition and the $175 price tag is pretty steep."
4,339,8.3,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2017-01-01,"Ultimately, the things I like about the 14 overshadow those that I don�t. Because of that, I thoroughly enjoyed playing in it."
1,339,8.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The LeBron 14 isn�t perfect, but no shoe is. Impact protection and overall mobility are great, traction wasn't bad either."
10,339,8.0,MR FOAMER SIMPSON,2017-01-01,"I value impact protection heavily, therefore, they are one of the best sneakers available right now."
11,339,7.8,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The overall court feel, transition, cushioning, and clean-floor traction make the LeBron 14 feel fast and smooth to play in."
3,339,7.4,Schwollo,2017-01-01,I consider the Lebron XIV one of the most comfortable but under performing Lebrons I�ve ever worn. Great cushioning and soft materials can only cover flaws to a certain extent.
6,339,7.2,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"As a guard, I did not enjoy the shoe. But for big guys this should be a great shoe."
6,340,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"As a guard, I don't like playing in these very much. Slightly bulky, and higher off the ground than I prefer. It's definitely a decent shoe, but it just wasn't for me."
5,340,8.2,Jarron Ramos [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"If you�re looking for a cloud-like ride, with great materials and a glove-like fit, the Zoom Rev �17 is going to get the job done really well."
11,340,8.0,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Zoom Rev 17 is an extremely solid option for someone looking for quickness, forefoot cushioning while still riding low, and a great fit."
6,341,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"A really nice shoe, I enjoyed playing in it a lot. This should have been the Kyrie 3. Guards - you will love it!"
1,341,8.6,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Taking the $100 price tag out of the equation, the Nike Zoom Live 2017 stands up against Nike�s higher priced models and outshines them. If you�re a fan of low tops then you�ll likely be a fan of these."
3,342,8.6,Schwollo,2017-01-01,"This is my first pass at the Mentality, I mean Instinct line and I am pleasantly surprised. I had a hard time differentiating performance wise between the Kobe 8; both sit low to the ground with excellent traction and fit."
6,342,8.4,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,At $100 you can't go wrong! A very minimal and responsive shoe for guards who don't need a lot of impact protection.
20,342,8.3,Analykix.com,2017-01-01,I really enjoyed playing in the Nike Mamba Mentality. You get to enjoy a Flyweave upper and a full-length Lunarlon midsole which is perfect for all-around players.
24,343,8.4,RicheeKim,2017-12-27,If you are a quick guard and you don't need a lot of impact protection then the Kyrie 3 is a great choice.
9,343,8.3,KickGenius,2017-01-01,Probably my favorite shoe to hoop in right now!
6,343,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"I really love to play in them, but I can't play a lot because of the lack of cushioning. Incredibly responsive shoe with excellent traction."
1,343,8.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed playing in the Kyrie 3,  If cushion is your main need then you should already know what that means for you and the Kyrie 3. But if court feel and traction are your only concerns then these might be your new best friend."
7,343,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"Decent, affordable shoe, especially if you are a small guard. Personally I didn't really like these shoes but at $120 they are definitely a decent performer."
4,343,7.8,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2017-01-01,"The Kyrie 3 is a solid shoe, but I can�t help but feel a bit disappointed. And this admittedly comes from the high expectations I had after liking the first two shoes so much. But from the design, to the cushioning, to the comfort, it�s just not what I�d hoped for."
10,343,7.7,MR FOAMER SIMPSON,2017-01-01,"Overall, I like the Kyrie 3 but I am not crazy about it. Not in my top-3 rotation, but a good sneaker with a fair price. Especially quick guards will like the traction and court feel."
2,343,7.4,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"I did thoroughly enjoy the shoe, particularly the materials and the traction. It's such a minimalistic shoe that Nike almost had everything working in unison -- almost. More cushion is definitely a much-needed necessity and a well thought out execution with support would suffice. This is a shoe for players that cut heavily, need minimalistic cushion, and rely on that court-feel."
3,343,7.4,Schwollo,2017-01-01,Not the best value out there but a good performer overall...The Kyrie 3 just feels like a quick high cut tennis shoe for players that value lateral quickness over everything else.
1,344,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The adidas Harden Vol. 1 is a very well balanced shoe for guards. Traction, cushion, materials, fit, support�the best of what adidas has to offer all on one sneaker? Reasonably priced? And they�ve been doing this all year long? You best believe it."
11,344,9.0,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"If you are a guard, or forward, or big man who doesn�t mind lows, you will enjoy this shoe. Fit, cushion, traction, and support are all nice for anyone unless you just feel like you need a super-light shoe (you don�t)."
6,344,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"The fit is good, the traction is amazing. The shoe feels light, and the cushion is very responsive. The Harden Vol. 1 is a very good shoe and does live up to the reputation James Harden has as a talented and explosive player."
24,344,8.9,RicheeKim,2017-12-27,These are my favourite shoes as of right now!
7,344,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"I like the cushioning, traction and materials, but I had sharp pain in the toe area and the lacing system is trash. Overall the Harden 1 is a pretty solid performance sneaker."
3,344,8.0,Schwollo,2017-01-01,"The Harden Vol 1 is one of those shoes I like a lot. Its tech is great, it looks good, it�s made well and it isn�t too expensive. However, Adidas ruined an excellent traction set up with the Fibonacci design and as a traction lover, this did the shoe in for me. Well that and my arch pain."
9,344,7.0,KickGenius,2017-01-01,"Overall, the shoe gets the job done. There's nothing special here, the shoe is a decent performer, but the traction threw me for a slip."
10,344,7.0,MR FOAMER SIMPSON,2017-01-01,"The fit was a little bit off, but I'd probably give those a 7/10. It's a great option for guards who are looking for traction and court feel."
11,345,9.2,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The Dame 3 combines great cushioning, good traction, killer materials, and a price that can�t be beat � into a package that, honestly, looks great too."
1,345,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"The adidas Dame 3 is a great sneaker. It�s very well rounded in every category and it will accommodate most players and foot shapes. From the traction, to the plush and bouncy cushion, to the materials that balance durability without the need for break-in time � the adidas Dame 3 has it all."
6,345,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"Overall, it's a really, really nice shoe. The cushion is nice, the traction is good but not the best on dusty courts and the materials are good. The only two things I didn't like are that the shoe feels slightly bulky especially in the heel and the lockdown is not very good."
7,345,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"Overall, this is a pretty solid hoops shoe, especially for the sticker price it goes for. You got great traction and cushioning, good support and lockdown and solid materials. Unfortunately the fit isn't very comfortable."
3,345,8.2,Schwollo,2017-01-01,"The improved traction really got me excited and I liked the faster feel of the Dame 3 cushioning. However, the lack of padding at the midfoot and especially around the ankle really made the lace pressure uncomfortable.  I feel like the Dame 3 is one of those shoes that performs well in every catagory but just under performs as a shoe overall."
9,345,8.0,KickGenius,2017-01-01,"Overall, I would probably still go with the D Lillard 2 over the Dame 3. But the Dame 3 isn't bad at all and gets the job done. Most people will enjoy this shoe, especially once you found a lacing pattern that is comfortable for you."
7,346,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"I love everything about the Kobe AD except the painful break-in period. The overall aesthetics are great, the cushion is on point, the lockdown is there. The shoe is lightweight but still supportive and sturdy."
6,346,8.6,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"Very good looking shoes for guards. I enjoy it, I really like the shoe. Unfortunately rather long break-in period."
3,346,7.8,Schwollo,2017-01-01,"I enjoyed playing in the Kobe AD a lot even though it wasn�t perfect. Great traction and excellent fit with firmer than normal Kobe line cushioning that needs break in but feels decent after. When you see the price of $160, you�ll expect more since other comparative shoes out there under that price point are offering nicer materials than the mesh on the Kobe AD."
24,346,7.6,RicheeKim,2017-12-27,"For $160 there are much better options out there. Great lockdown, but painful break-in period, cheap materials and lacking cushioning."
1,346,7.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,Utter disappointment. Was I duped? $160 spent and wasted. Those are my feelings when thinking about the Nike Kobe A.D. If you enjoy your pair then I am genuinely happy for you as that would mean you enjoy your purchase and don�t share the same sentiment that I do. Every once in a while a brand puts out a dud. This was a giant one.
5,346,6.6,Jarron Ramos [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"To put it bluntly, the Kobe A.D. has no innovation, no ambition, and nothing worthy enough to be associated with the five-time world champion, 18-time All-Star, 15-time All-NBA, future Hall of Famer, Kobe Bryant. The visual appeal of Kobe�s first post-retirement sneaker is off the charts but this is a performance review, and in that regard, the Kobe A.D. is more than just a disappointment."
1,347,9.0,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Tacky traction, much-improved cushion and very comfortable. The KT2 has enough of everything to make them a great option on-court, and it comes in at a reasonable price as well."
6,347,8.8,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,For $120 this is a great deal. The Anta KT2 is really amazing to play basketball in. I have no complaints at all - I love it!
7,347,8.5,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"High-quality materials, great cushioning and phenomenal traction. The Anta KT2 were my first Chinese sneakers and I really enjoyed them on-court!"
2,348,9.0,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2017-12-27,"The Rare Metal gives you premium materials, great cushioning, and damn near great traction."
11,348,8.6,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-12-27,"If you are looking for a highly cushioned, low profile and low-cut rocket for your feet, especially on clean courts, then the Rare Metal is your pick."
3,348,8.4,Schwollo,2017-12-27,"The Rare Metal is a shoe that does nearly everything well. If the traction was more consistent and more aggressive, I wouldn�t hesitate to put this into my rotation maybe even into my top 5."
6,348,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2018-01-26,"I was really disappointed by the traction - otherwise this is a great shoe. If you play on clean courts, then the BrandBlack Rare Metal is a great choice."
1,349,9.2,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,The Curry 3 is a great shoe on-court. Especially speedy guards will enjoy their time in these. If you�re a fan of the Curry 1 and 2 then you�ll likely love the 3.
7,349,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,"I rank the Curry 3 above the Curry 2 and the Curry 2.5 but only by a very slim margin. There are some improvements, but overall the shoe performs very similar."
11,349,8.8,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"You get great traction, Charged cushioning, and great lockdown after a short break in. If you are looking for a quick response and death-grip sticky soles, look no further."
5,349,8.8,Jarron Ramos [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Steph obviously values traction and light-weight support and the Curry 3 gives you exactly that. The cushion setup is highly responsive but delivers only average impact protection.  To me, the Curry 3 falls just short of being a top-tier on-court performer."
20,349,8.8,Analykix.com,2018-01-29,Am I happy with how the shoe performed? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes!
9,349,8.8,KickGenius,2017-01-01,"Overall, I really enjoyed the Curry 3 and hooped in them a lot. They definitely got the job done! I really expect a lot from Under Armour going forward!"
3,349,8.6,Schwollo,2017-01-01,The Curry 3 is a solid and smooth shoe that performs well in every category but nothing outstanding. Slightly softer cushioning than the Curry 2/2.5 and softer materials but not an upgrade overall.
6,349,8.2,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"I really enjoyed the shoe. The traction in dusty conditions was a little lackluster. Other than that, it's a really nice shoe with amazing materials, good support and decent cushioning."
24,349,8.0,RicheeKim,2017-12-27,The Curry 3 is a good performer on the court. I recommend these if you like firm and responsive cushioning.
23,349,7.8,QuickKicks [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Despite the great build quality and solid materials, the Curry 3 is a shoe that didn�t work for my play style. If you�re a fast-paced guard that loves court feel (like Steph Curry himself) you�ll probably enjoy this shoe. However, more explosive players and those who need more impact protection should probably look elsewhere."
2,350,8.8,Stanley T. [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Does the shoe perform? It absolutely does. I do like how the shoe adapts to my movements while providing adequate lockdown and support. The cushion feels fine but I was expecting something totally different or new, and the traction has its suspect points."
9,350,8.6,KickGenius,2017-01-01,I wasn't impressed by the Air Jordan 31 because the traction really holds them back. Other then that it is a pretty solid shoe and get's the job done.
4,350,8.5,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2017-01-01,"I�ve come to expect the best from the modern Air Jordan line when it comes to performance, and the Air Jordan 31 fully delivers. There are a few matters of personal preference, but overall, there is little to criticize."
7,350,8.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,I did like the super soft woven upper and the responsive cushion.But inconsistent traction and pain in the heel from the achilles padding keep this shoe from being in my regular rotation.
1,350,7.8,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,Each piece of the shoe is great. Put them together and it�s not a perfect match. The biggest issue to tackle is how to get full length unlocked Zoom to be more stable underfoot.
6,350,7.8,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,These shoes are absolutely incredible - aside from the catastrophic failure that is the traction. I can't play in these because the traction is literally dangerous.
10,350,7.8,MR FOAMER SIMPSON,2017-01-01,"Overall, my opinion of the Air Jordan 31 is really mixed. Definitely a drop-off from previous models, but still a solid performance sneaker."
11,351,9.0,Duke4005 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"Best. KD. EVER. Seriously. Besides a little less support than some need, there are no problems with this shoe. Traction � excellent. Cushioning � beyond excellent. Materials � the best Nike has to offer."
6,351,9.0,The Sole Brothers,2017-01-01,"Overall, definitely get these. The cushioning feels really nice, the traction is good and the materials are super premium."
7,351,9.0,Nelson Chan @Hoop and Life,2017-01-01,At $150 the KD9 is a good deal considering the great performance it delivers.
10,351,8.8,MR FOAMER SIMPSON,2017-01-01,I think this is the best overall sneaker out right now.  A very versatile shoe that works for all type of players.
9,351,8.5,KickGenius,2017-01-01,"The shoe gets the job done and performs very well. Unfortunately, the upper material is not very comfortable and the price is a little too high for what you get."
1,351,8.4,NightWing2303 [weartesters.com],2017-01-01,"You receive solid traction, fantastic cushion, great materials, and if you get the size that fits you best, you�ll also receive a solid and secure fit for optimal support."
3,351,8.4,Schwollo,2017-01-01,"The KD 9 is a shoe everyone will enjoy, mainly because the fit, comfort and cushioning is amazing right out of the box. However, I need a little more support, containment, and traction during competitive play."
4,351,8.0,Zac Dubasik [SoleCollector.com],2017-01-01,"As a performance sneaker, it just didn�t work for me. Above all else, the one thing I need to have in a shoe is confidence, and I didn�t have it in the KD 9."
